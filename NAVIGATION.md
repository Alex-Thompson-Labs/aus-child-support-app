## 🎯 WHAT TO READ WHEN

### Right Now (Dec 24):
1. Read `/docs/BUSINESS_MODEL.md` (5 min) - understand what you're building
2. Read `/guides/CHRISTMAS_BREAK_PLAN.md` (10 min) - your todo list
3. Start Step 1: Delete old docs ✅ DONE
4. Start Step 2: Add special circumstances fields

### When Confused About Phase 1:
- Read `/guides/phase1/STATUS.md` - quick summary
- Reference `/guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md` - full details (don't redo tasks 0-6)

### When Ready for Phase 2 (Jan 2+):
- Read `/guides/phase2/STATUS.md` - what Phase 2 is about
- Follow `/guides/phase2/CHECKLIST.md` - week-by-week implementation

### When Stuck:
- Check `/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - common issues
- Ask Claude Code for help

---

## ❌ IGNORE THESE (Reference Only)

These are detailed implementation guides. You don't need to read them unless stuck:

- `/guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md` - Tasks 0-6 are done, only reference if needed
- `/guides/phase2/CHECKLIST.md` - Future work, not relevant until Jan 2
- `/guides/phase2/README.md` - Future strategy

---

## ✅ YOUR SIMPLE WORKFLOW

**Today through Jan 1:**
```
Work from: /guides/CHRISTMAS_BREAK_PLAN.md
Follow steps 1-5 in order
```

**Jan 2 onwards:**
```
Work from: /guides/phase2/CHECKLIST.md
Start with Week 1
```
