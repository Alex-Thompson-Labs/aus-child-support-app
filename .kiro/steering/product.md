## Business Model
- **Revenue**: $50 per qualified lead (pay-per-lead model)

- **Target Market**: Family law firms in Australia (3-10 lawyers, major metro areas)

## Current Phase: 3A - Validation (January 2026)

2. **Partner Track**: Pitch exclusive partner model (firm funds $500 ads, zero financial risk)

## Key Conversion Flow
1. Parent uses calculator → instant results
2. Complexity detection identifies high-value cases (income variance, court dates, Change of Assessment)
3. Alert shown with "Get Legal Help" CTA
4. Inquiry form captures lead with consent
5. Lead saved to Supabase database (encrypted, Privacy Act compliant)
6. Admin reviews → sends teaser email to lawyer
7. Lawyer confirms interest → charged $50 → receives Secure Magic Link

## Entry Points
- **Main Calculator**: Standard flow through calculator
- **Direct Inquiry**: `/lawyer-inquiry?mode=direct&reason=X` (blog traffic, bypasses calculator)
- **Special Circumstances**: `/special-circumstances` (factor selection first)

## Critical Rules for AI Assistants
- **NEVER fabricate metrics**: Don't invent traffic numbers, conversion rates, or user counts
- **NEVER claim proven results**: This is Phase 3A validation - we're PROVING the model, not selling proven data
- **ALWAYS be transparent**: When creating outreach materials, clearly state this is a validation pilot
- **ASK for data**: If specific metrics are needed, ask the user rather than making assumptions
- **Validation context**: We have NO paying lawyers yet, NO proven conversion rates, NO historical lead data
- **What we DO have**: Working calculator, complexity detection, admin dashboard, database infrastructure
