## Key Improvements

### Before vs After Examples

**1. Shared Care 50/50 (Your Original Example)**
- **Before (155 chars):** "Yes, you still pay with 50/50 care if you earn more. Learn how equal care affects child support in Australia. Real examples, calculator, and dispute resolution."
- **After (149 chars):** "50/50 care doesn't mean $0 child support. Higher earner pays $100-600/month based on income gap. See real examples + free calculator. Check in 5 minutes."
- **Improvement:** Myth-bust hook, specific payment range, time urgency

**2. Self-Employed**
- **Before (127 chars):** "How business income is assessed for child support. Learn what expenses get added back, trust scrutiny, and when you need legal advice."
- **After (149 chars):** "Self-employed? Services Australia adds back 15+ expenses you claimed. See what counts + trust scrutiny. Errors cost $1,000s/year. Check your assessment."
- **Improvement:** Specific number (15+ expenses), financial consequence, urgency

**3. How to Calculate**
- **Before (139 chars):** "Calculate child support in 5 minutes using the official 2026 formula. Step-by-step guide with examples. Free calculator, no registration. Get accurate estimates now."
- **After (144 chars):** "Manual calculation takes 60 minutes + risks $1,000s in errors. Our calculator uses official 2026 formula. Get accurate results in 5 minutes. Free."
- **Improvement:** Time/risk comparison, error cost, efficiency benefit
