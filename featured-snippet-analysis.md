H2: Does Child Support Change With 50/50 Custody in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Yes, you still pay child support with 50/50 care if you earn more than the 
other parent. In Australia, equal care (183 nights each) means both parents 
have 50% care and 50% cost percentages. However, the higher-income parent 
pays based on the income difference. Only if both parents earn exactly the 
same would child support be zero. Typical payments range from $100-$600/month 
depending on income gap and number of children.

8 steps: calculate child support income (taxable income minus $31,046), 
determine combined income, calculate income percentages, look up costs from 
official tables, convert care to cost percentages, then apply: (Income % - 
Cost %) × Total Costs. This ensures fair payments based on capacity to pay
