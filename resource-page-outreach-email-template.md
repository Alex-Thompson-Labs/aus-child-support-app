Dear [CLC Name] Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out about a free tool that may benefit your clients.

**Resource:** Australian Child Support Calculator

We've developed a free child support calculator that implements the official Services Australia formula. **This is the only calculator that handles all 6 child support formulas** (Formula 1-6), including complex multi-case scenarios that the government calculator doesn't cover.

- Multiple children across different relationships
- Income support and Centrelink payments
- Change of Assessment factors

**Why this matters for your clients:**
Many people come to CLCs confused about child support. This calculator:
- Helps them understand their obligations before appointments
- Identifies complex cases that need legal advice
- Saves time in initial consultations
- Empowers clients with information

**Request:**
Would you consider adding this to your resources page or sharing it with clients? It's completely free, requires no registration, and doesn't collect any personal data.

I'm happy to discuss how this tool could support your work.
