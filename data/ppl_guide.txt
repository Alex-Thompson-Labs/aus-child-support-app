2.3.2 Adjusted taxable income (ATI) for PLP

Introduction

ATI

is used in the

FTB

,

CCS

and

PPL

income tests when assessing an individual's eligibility for these payments. While the income tests are different for the PPL scheme and family assistance payments, such as FTB and CCS, ATI is used to assess eligibility for each payment.

An individual's ATI is:

the sum of the following amounts for the relevant income year

taxable income

the value of any adjusted fringe benefits (

1.1.A.30

)

target foreign income (

1.1.T.10

)

total net investment losses (

1.1.T.80

)

tax free pension or benefit, and

reportable superannuation contributions (

1.1.R.40

)

less 100% of the individual's deductible child maintenance expenditure.

Note:

This is the same definition as applies to family assistance law, FAAct schedule 3, except that subclause

2(2)

relating to when an individual dies and clauses 3, 3AA and 3A relating to members of a couple - have no application to

PLP

.

See FA Guide

Part 3

for detail relating to the above amounts.

Assessment of ATI

In determining whether an individual meets the income test, Centrelink uses either:

the individual's taxable income as assessed by the

ATO

, plus the additional components of ATI, for the reference income year, or

a statement of ATI in the relevant financial year, provided by the individual and assessed as reasonable by Centrelink.

Centrelink may request the claimant to provide details of their taxable income as assessed by ATO, as well as information on the additional components of ATI, where such assessment is available.

If the claimant cannot provide the details of their taxable income during the reference income year as assessed by the ATO, they can provide their own calculation of their ATI.

Reasonable calculation of income

If the claimant has calculated their ATI, Centrelink will determine if the calculation is reasonable. If Centrelink does not consider the calculation reasonable, the claimant has not satisfied the income test and therefore the claimant has no entitlement to PLP.

Review of an income determination

If it has been determined that a person is eligible for PLP and that determination took into account the income of the person, and the person did not knowingly make a false or misleading statement about their income, a review of the eligibility determination may not vary the income determination or substitute a new determination that the person did not meet the income test.

Where claimants have made a reasonable and honest effort to correctly calculate their ATI and their actual income differs from the calculated amount, PLP will still be payable.

Treatment of income if the claimant is a member of a couple

The income of a claimant’s partner will be included in an assessment if they are being assessed against the relevant family PPL income limit. It will not be included if being assessed against the relevant individual PPL income limit.

1.4.4 Liability of decision makers

Decisions subject to a right of review under the Act

A person affected by a decision of an officer under

PPL

law may apply for a review of the decision. Services Australia should not accept liability if an incorrect decision has been made under PPL law when there is a right of review available to the person.

Liability when giving advice

Liability will generally not arise if the reason for the advice being incorrect was that the claimant/recipient had provided incorrect information and there was no reason for the staff member to query the accuracy of that information.

No liability will arise if the advice was incorrect because the officer reached a view of the law that was reasonable.

However, the officer may be negligent if they:

failed to check the relevant law, or

carelessly misread a clear statement of the law.

Avoiding liability when giving advice

To ensure reasonable care is taken when giving advice, staff should do the following:

Ensure that they obtain and understand all relevant facts.

Ensure that the relevant law is identified and understood.

Apply the law to the facts to give advice that is easy to understand and accurate. The staff member should ensure that they understand why the advice is required and tailor the advice to the applicant/recipient's individual needs.

When the staff member does not know the answer to the question, they should inform the applicant/recipient that they will contact them after obtaining the relevant information.

When there are still doubts about the reliability of the information or the authority of the staff member to provide advice, these should be made known to the applicant/recipient.

In some circumstances, suggest to applicants/recipients that they should seek independent advice from suitably qualified people.

Ensure the applicant/recipient understands when the advice or information given is of an interim or conditional nature.

Ensure the applicant/recipient is advised that their question is ultimately for the courts to determine and that they should not rely on Services Australia advice if information or advice is sought on a question of legal interpretation. Where advice is sought on this basis, the applicant/recipient should be advised to seek an independent opinion on the law and its statutory interpretation.

In some circumstances, indicate that while all care is taken in providing the information or advice, no responsibility is accepted for any loss incurred as a result.

Where Services Australia is the authoritative source

Disclaimers of the kind recommended above are not appropriate if Services Australia is the only authoritative source of information or advice on a matter and it is reasonable for Services Australia to provide it.

Call centres

The Attorney-General's Department has advised that liability may arise if advice is issued by a call centre. Services Australia actively encourages claimants/recipients to use call centres as the first point of contact. Claimants/recipients are entitled to assume that if unconditional advice is provided by a Services Australia call centre, they can rely on that advice without taking further action.

Call centre staff must ensure that advice given is correct and, if in doubt, that the claimant/recipient is advised of this doubt and given the option to have the matter referred to an area that can answer the claimant/recipient's query.

4.3.6.40 Referral of matter to FWO relating to employer failure to pay instalment of PLP

Introduction

Where Centrelink has referred a matter to the

FWO

because the employer has allegedly not paid an instalment of

PLP

as required, Centrelink must pay instalments of PLP from the

PPL

instalment period that begins on or after the day after the last flexible PPL day that falls within the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for which the employer has been funded (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)), if Centrelink is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, and provided the FWO has not notified Centrelink before the transfer day that the employer has not complied with a compliance notice given for the failure to pay.

Where the FWO has notified Centrelink that the employer has not complied with a compliance notice given for the failure to pay one or more instalments as required, then the employer determination will be revoked and Centrelink must pay the person instalments from the instalment period that begins on or after the day (the transfer day) the revocation comes into force.

If Centrelink has both revoked the employer determination and has also referred the matter of a contravention by an employer to the FWO, then the provision where the transfer day occurs first is taken to apply (the provision which allows Centrelink to take over payment of instalments earlier will prevail).

2.5 Caring for a child

Introduction

PLP

is designed to support eligible parents who have been in the work force to take time off work to care for their newborn child. It also assists carers to take time off work to care for a recently adopted child or to care for a child in some exceptional circumstances. A claimant must generally be caring for the child (

1.1.C.10

) on a flexible

PPL

day (

1.1.F.70

) in order to be eligible on that day.

A person is caring for a child on a day if the child is in their care on the day. More than one person can be caring for a child on a day.

The PPL Rules prescribe conditions where a PPL or special PPL claimant remains eligible for PLP on a day that they are not caring for a child, where they are temporarily unable to care for the child (

1.1.T.50

) or where they have lost care of the child (

1.1.L.30

) without their consent.

Additionally, a birth mother who relinquishes their child in a surrogacy or adoption arrangement, or a birth mother whose child was removed from their care by a state or territory child protection agency or in accordance with a decision of a court of a state or territory, may be an eligible PPL claimant for PLP even though they are not caring for the child.

The birth mother will only be eligible on a day within:

20 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2023

22 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2024

24 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2025

26 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2026.

4.3.7.20 Payment of arrears of PLP - employer determination revoked after coming into force

Introduction

PPLAct section 107 provides that an employer determination comes into force if either the employer has accepted the determination or because following a review of the determination the employer provides bank account and pay cycle details.

An employer determination that has come into force either must or may be revoked for the reasons outlined in PPLAct section 108.

If an employer determination is revoked under section 108 after it has come into force, under PPLAct subsection 84(4) Centrelink must pay instalments of

PLP

from the

PPL

instalment period that begins on or after the day the revocation comes into force (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)) (

4.3.6.30

).

In addition to this requirement, Centrelink must pay the instalments that are owed to the person as arrears for the period before Centrelink commenced paying instalments under PPLAct subsection 84(4), on the same payday that Centrelink must pay an instalment under subsection 84(4), if:

the employer has not as at the payday for the instalment, paid all or part of an instalment that was payable to the person by the employer, and

either

the

FWO

has notified Centrelink that the employer has not complied with a compliance notice relating to unauthorised deductions or payment of instalments by the employer, or

the employer determination was revoked because Centrelink was satisfied the employer was insolvent.

Centrelink is not required to pay the person all or part of the instalment if the person has recovered all or part of the instalment from their employer through legal proceedings.

6.2.4 Civil penalty orders

Introduction

Employers have a direct role in the delivery of

PLP

. Their compliance with obligations under the

PPL

law is essential for proper administration of the PPL scheme. Civil penalties and infringement notices do not directly affect individuals eligible for PLP as they apply only to employers with obligations imposed by PPL law. Employers have obligations in relation to the payment of instalments of PLP to a person if there is an employer determination in force for the employer and the person.

The Secretary or the

FWO

or their delegates may apply to the Federal Court or a Federal Circuit Court of Australia for a civil penalty order to be made for a breach by an employer of a civil penalty provision. If the court is satisfied that a person has contravened one or more civil penalty provisions, the court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty. This is a civil penalty order.

Note:

The Secretary's power to delegate his or her powers under Parts 4 and 5 of the

Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014

(which deal with civil penalty orders and infringement notices) is limited to delegation to the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Chief Executive Medicare, or to an

SES

employee or acting SES employee.

Under subsection 82(5) of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act, the pecuniary penalty that a court could order a person to pay is the number of penalty units corresponding to the civil penalty provision in the table below. If the person is a body corporate, the penalty must not be more than 5 times the number of penalty units corresponding to the civil penalty provision in the table below.

Example:

The penalty the court could order an individual to pay for a contravention of subsection 72(1) must not be more than 60 penalty units. The penalty a court could order a body corporate to pay for a contravention of subsection 72(1) must not be more than 300 penalty units.

The civil penalty provisions in the PPLAct are listed in column 1 below. The relevant maximum penalty that a court could order a person to pay for contravention of the provision is provided in column 2. If the person is a body corporate, the maximum pecuniary penalty a court could order for a contravention of a civil penalty provision is 5 times the number of penalty units in column 2.

30 penalty units

Subsection 157(4) - in relation to a contravention of a compliance notice given in relation to any other civil penalty provision.

60 penalty units

Factors the court must take into account

The Court has discretion to determine the amount of the pecuniary penalty it considers appropriate. However, in doing so, the Court must take into account all relevant matters. These include:

The nature and extent of the contravention.

The nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention.

The circumstances in which the contravention took place.

Whether the person has previously been found by a court (including a court in a foreign country) to have engaged in any similar conduct.

Other provisions in the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act specify that:

A relevant court may direct that 2 or more proceedings for civil penalty orders are to be heard together.

An application for a civil penalty order must be made no later than 6 years after the contravention by the employer.

Rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters apply to proceedings for a civil penalty order.

If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be brought under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act against a person in relation to contravention of any one or more of those civil penalty provisions. However, a person is not liable for more than one penalty in relation to the same conduct.

If civil proceedings take place AFTER criminal proceedings the court cannot make a civil penalty order against a person who has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention of a civil penalty provision.

Civil proceedings must be stayed where criminal proceedings are commenced for conduct substantially the same as that which constituted contravention of the civil penalty provision, but may be resumed if the person is not convicted.

Criminal proceedings may be commenced against a person for conduct substantially the same as that constituting contravention of a civil penalty provision, whether or not a civil penalty order has been made against the person.

If a person has given evidence in civil penalty proceedings, it cannot be used in criminal proceedings against the person if the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is the same or substantially the same as that constituting the contravention. This does not apply if the criminal proceedings related to false evidence given in the civil penalty proceedings.

In certain circumstances, a person may be required to give all reasonable assistance in connection with an application for a civil penalty order, whether or not the application for the civil penalty order has been made. Failure to comply with a written request by the Secretary to provide all reasonable assistance is an offence, the penalty for which is 12 penalty units multiplied by the number of contraventions.

The Secretary can only request a person's assistance if it appears that the person is unlikely to have contravened the same civil penalty provision to which the application relates; or committed an offence constituted by the same or substantially the same conduct; and the Secretary suspects or believes that the person could give relevant information.

The Secretary cannot request the assistance of a person who is or has been a lawyer for the person who is the subject of the application for the civil penalty order.

The Secretary may apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court of Australia for an order that a person comply with a request for assistance by the Secretary in a specified way.

Fair Work Inspectors have specific compliance powers under the

Fair Work Act 2009

, including powers to interview any person while on premises and to require a person to produce a record or document, which can be exercised for the purpose of determining whether PPLAct section 70 or Part 3-2 is being, or has been, complied with.

1.4.1 Beneficial administration of the legislation

What is beneficial legislation?

Legislation is characterised as 'beneficial' when its purpose is to provide benefits to those affected. The PPLAct is regarded as beneficial legislation because it provides assistance to parents with newborn or recently adopted children. This means where legislative ambiguities arise, the legislation should be interpreted in a way that is most beneficial to claimants/recipients as a whole.

When is the beneficial approach applied?

A beneficial approach can only be applied where the legislation is unclear and there are no policy directives on how the relevant section of the legislation should be interpreted. Consideration must be given as to whether a particular interpretation would be beneficial to most claimants/recipients. Once a favourable interpretation of a section has been made, that approach is to be adopted in all cases. Therefore, it is not possible to apply different interpretations on a case-by-case basis once a beneficial interpretation has been determined for that piece of legislation.

7.2.3 Procedures for ART reviews

Introduction

The rules relating to review by the

ART

are mainly in the ARTAct. However, the PPLAct modifies the rules and procedures contained in the ART Act in some ways for the purposes of ART reviews of

PPL

matters. This section is about the procedures to be followed in relation to ART reviews of reviewable claimant decisions and reviewable employer decisions.

Providing reasons & documents following receipt of application for ART review

The ART must give both the applicant and Centrelink written notice of an application for ART review. If the ART considers that another person's interests may be affected by the decision being reviewed then the ART can give written notice, of the application and their right to apply to be a party, to that person or require the applicant to do so.

Note:

A person whose interests are affected by the decision in their capacity as an employer cannot apply to be a party to a review of an ART reviewable claimant decision (

1.1.A.02

).

Unless the ART orders otherwise or the ART's practice directions state otherwise, Centrelink must provide the ART with a statement about the reasons for the decision under review and a copy of all relevant documents in its possession/control within 28 days of the application.

Note:

The statement of reasons for the decision may be but does not have to be the same as that given to the applicant by Centrelink following the original decision.

After an application by one of the parties or of its own initiative the ART may request that Centrelink send the statement and documents sooner than 28 days. If the ART does so, Centrelink must take all reasonable steps to comply with this request. This may occur, for example, in cases in which financial hardship could occur pending the determination of the appeal.

Centrelink may apply to the ART to extend the period within which it must give the statement and copies of documents. The ART on this application or of its own initiative extend the period even if it has already expired.

Once Centrelink has provided the ART with a statement of reasons for the decision the ART may order Centrelink to provide a statement with further information in relation to:

findings on material questions of fact in relation to the decision

evidence or other material on which the findings were based

reasons for the decision.

The timeframe for providing this statement will be specified in the order.

If any relevant documents, not previously provided to the ART, come into the possession or under the control of Centrelink after the initial statement and documents have been sent but before the determination of the review, Centrelink must send a copy of the later documents to the ART within 28 days, or within a longer period if specified under a practice direction, of the document coming into its possession or control. The ART may also request Centrelink provide a copy of a document (or class of documents) in its possession/control which the ART is satisfied is relevant to a review. Such a request will specify a period in which Centrelink must provide the requested copies.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 227 Procedure on receipt of application for certain ART reviews

ARTAct

Part 3 Division 4 subdivision B Provision of reasons and documents

Centrelink to provide other parties with statements & documents provided to the ART

Centrelink must give a copy of all statements and documents it has been required to provide to the ART to the other parties within the same period it was required to provide them to the ART.

Exception:

The ART can make orders or develop practice directions not to provide copies of statements or documents, including to specific parties.

Exception:

Where the ART is still resolving whether to restrict publication or disclosure of information following an application by a person, and the person has provided the relevant statements or copies of documents to the ART and a copy of their application to restrict the information to all other parties to the review, Centrelink is not required to disclose the information further until the ART has decided on the application and ordered Centrelink to provide it.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 27 Decision-maker must give copies of reasons and documents to other parties—general rule, section 28 Exceptions—Tribunal may adjust requirements, section 29 Exception—while resolving whether to restrict publication or disclosure of information

Hearing of ART reviews in private

The hearing of an ART review of a PPL decision must be in private. The ART may give directions in writing or otherwise, as to who may be present at any hearing of an ART review. In exercising this discretion, the ART must have regard to the wishes of the parties and the need to protect their privacy.

Exception:

Guidance and appeal panel reviews must be held in public unless there is a valid practice direction or ART order requiring otherwise.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 232 Hearing of certain ART reviews in private

Costs of ART review

Each party must bear their own expenses incurred in relation to the ART review. However, the ART may determine that the Commonwealth is to pay the reasonable costs that are incurred by a party for travel and accommodation expenses in relation to the review.

The ART also may determine that the Commonwealth pay the costs of a medical service that the ART arranges for a party to an ART review.

7.1.4 When a decision made on review comes into force

Introduction

A decision to vary a claimant decision (

1.1.C.110

) or set aside a claimant decision and substitute a new decision comes into operation on the day that would give full effect to the review decision.

Example:

A self-employed parent claims 90 flexible

PPL

days to be paid on continuous weekdays from 34 weeks after the child's birth.

Three weeks after payment has started to be received, it is determined that

PLP

is not payable because the claimant was not eligible on the relevant days.

Ten weeks after the determination is made that PLP is not payable, the claimant seeks review of the decision. Although an application for internal review normally should be made within 28 days of the day the decision is made, Centrelink is satisfied that a longer period can apply because of the particular circumstances of the claimant.

The review decision, which is made 14 days before the child's first birthday, sets aside the decision and substitutes a new decision that PLP is payable to the claimant.

The review decision means that PLP is payable from week 34 and that the claimant (at the time of the making of the review decision) should have received 8 instalments of PLP from the first nominated PLP day.

A lump sum payment that equals the amount for the 8 instalments should be made as soon as practicable; in this example this could be paid with the claimants ninth and final instalment of PLP.

The claimant will receive the full 90 days as claimed.

Note:

A decision comes into operation immediately on the giving of the decision if it is a decision to vary an employer determination decision (

1.1.E.70

) or an employer funding amount decision (

1.1.E.80

) or set aside such a decision and substitute a new decision.

6.3.6.20 Waiver of debts - administrative error

Summary

Centrelink must waive the right to recover so much of a debt that is solely attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if:

the debtor received the payment or payments that gave rise to the proportion of the debt in good faith, and

the debtor would suffer severe financial hardship if it were not waived.

Severe financial hardship

The issue of severe financial hardship should be decided on an individual basis, taking into account the recipient's circumstances. These would include:

the make-up of the family group (for example, single parent, number of children)

current family income and expenses

available funds, and

exceptional expenses (for example, funeral or pharmaceutical costs).

There must be clear evidence that severe financial hardship would result (after reasonable expenses are deducted from income) if recovery of the debt were pursued. Reasonable expenditure includes, but is not limited to: rent, mortgage or other minimum loan repayments, groceries, electricity, school fees, medical costs, etc.

The rate of income support, including the family assistance a family group would be paid if they were eligible, may be used as a benchmark when comparing the family's income and expenditure. If the family's income is greater than this amount but their reported expenditure leaves a net income less than the minimum repayment amount, then it may be relevant to examine whether their expenditure is reasonable.

For the purpose of considering waiver or a write off, a person would be subject to severe financial hardship if their net fortnightly income (after reasonable expenses are deducted) over the debt repayment period would be less than the minimum fortnightly amount the person would be allowed to repay under the flexible repayment arrangements for family assistance debts.

Example:

Lydia is a sole parent with a new baby. Lydia received 10 weeks of flexible

PPL

in a block, before starting on 6 weeks of parental leave provided by her employer. Lydia is expecting to resume taking her flexible PPL 2 days a week to support her return to work once her employer-provided leave is exhausted. Lydia has accurately claimed her dates of

PLP

, and assumed that her PLP days would be paid as requested. However, due to an administrative error, she was paid an additional week of PLP.

Unfortunately, Lydia’s employer closed down and she is currently unemployed. Lydia's PLP debt was caused solely by administrative error and was received in good faith. Lydia has appealed against the decision to recover the debt as she says that this would place her family in severe financial hardship. Lydia has provided Centrelink with information to support her request including a detailed fortnightly statement of financial circumstances listing her income and expenditure. Lydia's expenses are reasonable and include necessary costs such as rent, food, petrol, electricity, gas and school fees. She has provided supporting receipts and invoices. In addition to her regular expenses Lydia also has substantial debts due to a recent illness and has no savings or readily convertible assets.

After taking into account Lydia's regular expenses it was found that her remaining income would be less than the minimum repayment amount required over the repayment period. It is clear that Lydia could not sustain her financial responsibilities and repay the debt. Recovery would cause Lydia severe financial hardship and the debt may be waived.

6.3.6.40 Waiver of small debts

Summary

Centrelink must waive the debt if:

the debt is, or is likely to be, less than $200, and

it is not cost effective for the Commonwealth to take action to recover the debt.

Exception:

If the debt is $50 or more and could be recovered by deduction or setting off in relation to a payment to which the debtor is entitled under the PPLAct or another Act, Centrelink will take action to recover the debt. This may include where a person has flexible

PPL

days available to be claimed at a later date and they have been found conditionally eligible for

PLP

for flexible PPL days, or where a person has a payability determination for one or more flexible PPL days for a future date.

Cost effectiveness

In determining whether it is cost effective to pursue the recovery of a debt the following factors should be considered:

the amount of the debt

the cost of any further investigation

the cost of recovery in terms of staff resources, calculating and recording the debt and advising the debtor, and

the prospect for recovery.

9.2.1 Payment of the PPLSC

Determining where a PPLSC is to be paid

If the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) makes a determination of the amount of

PPLSC

payable for a person for an income year (

1.1.I.30

), they must determine where the PPLSC is to be paid. The following table shows how the Commissioner determines where a PPLSC is to be paid.

).

The person has nominated an eligible account (

1.1.E.35

) to the Commissioner for the purpose of receiving a PPLSC.

The eligible account.

The person has one or more eligible accounts and has not nominated an eligible account to the Commissioner for the purpose of receiving a PPLSC.

if paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) do not apply, the eligible account determined by the Commissioner.

The person does not have an eligible account.

An account of the person in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account (

1.1.S.97

).

Note:

If 2 or more items of the table apply to a PPLSC, only the item that is earliest in the table is to be used.

The Commissioner must make this determination as soon as reasonably possible once they have sufficient information to determine where the PPLSC is to be paid.

In circumstances where the person does not have an eligible account, the Commissioner must not make a determination that the PPLSC is to be paid to an account of the person in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account before the end of the 2 year period beginning on the first day that:

a PPL funding amount for the person was paid to the person’s employer for the first time in the income year, or

an instalment of PLP was payable and paid to the person for the first time in the income year.

The Commissioner may revoke a determination of where a PPLSC is to be paid if satisfied that:

payment of the PPLSC cannot be made in accordance with the determination, or

it is appropriate in the circumstances to revoke the determination.

8.1.4 Commonwealth employment

Introduction

The PPLAct applies to a person who is engaged by or on behalf of the Commonwealth as an employee to perform functions in a Commonwealth agency as if:

the employee were employed by the agency (rather than the Commonwealth), for whom the person is to perform functions

the agency were a body corporate, and

the agency head has all the rights, duties and powers of an employer in relation to the employee.

A Commonwealth agency for this purpose means:

a non-corporate Commonwealth entity within the meaning of the

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

(PGPA Act)

any other unincorporated body established for a public purpose by or under a law of the Commonwealth.

This enables an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) to be made for an employee and the specific Commonwealth department or agency they are employed with.

However, in determining whether an employer determination must be made for a Commonwealth employee and an employer, the length of employment with the Commonwealth, rather than with an individual department or agency, must be taken into account.

Centrelink must make an employer determination in relation to a claim for

PLP

, where all the criteria for making an employer determination are satisfied, including where the person has, or will have, been employed by the Commonwealth for at least 12 months prior to their child's expected or actual

DOB

6.3.1.50 Debts under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990

Summary

If an amount has been paid to or in relation to a person by way of an instalment of

PLP

and the amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth under the

Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990

subsection 11(6), it is recoverable by the Commonwealth.

This situation arises if Centrelink gives a person notice under the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act subsection 11(6) that they propose to cancel, suspend, or reduce the amount of assistance and the person does not show cause why the action should not be taken within 28 days of the notice. Any payments made above the reduced rate or amount during that 28-day period is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

1.1.I.40 Indexation factor

Definition

The individual

PPL

income limit (

1.1.I.55

) and the family PPL income limit (

1.1.F.10

) are indexed to the

CPI

. The indexation factor is used to calculate the indexed estimate or indexed actual income that may be used to establish the PPL income limits. It is derived by dividing the index number for the reference December quarter (that is, the most recent December quarter before the indexation day) by the index number for the base December quarter (the December quarter that has the highest index number of the December quarters before the reference December quarter, but no earlier than December 2007).

The index number for a quarter means the All groups CPI number that is the weighted average of the 8 capital cities and is published by the Australian Statistician.

The indexation factor is worked out to 3 decimal places but rounded upwards by 0.001 if the fourth decimal place is more than 4.

If the indexation factor would be less than one, it is to be increased to one.

1.1.C.143 Conditional eligibility determination

Definition

Where a person makes a claim under the PPLAct section 13, or section 14 as the partner of a

PPL

claimant in exceptional circumstances (

1.1.E.100

), Centrelink must make a conditional eligibility determination for the person if:

Centrelink determines that

PLP

is not payable to the person under the relevant section because they do not meet one of the criteria, and

Centrelink is satisfied that the person satisfies the work test and the income test.

The purpose of a conditional eligibility determination is to ensure that people who have already applied for PLP in relation to a child do not have to resubmit an initial claim form and provide work test and income test information multiple times for the same child.

6.2.3.10 Giving an infringement notice

When can an infringement notice be issued?

An infringement notice may be issued under Part 5 of the

Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014

if Centrelink or the

FWO

reasonably believes that the employer (individual or body corporate) has contravened a civil penalty provision (

1.1.C.80

). Centrelink or the FWO can give infringement notices in relation to different civil penalty provisions under the PPLAct.

Centrelink may issue infringement notices for contraventions of the PPLAct:

subsection 82(2) (notifying Centrelink if certain events happen)

section 103 (responding to an employer determination)

subsection 105(3) (giving bank account and pay cycle details etc. following a review), and

subsection 157(4) (non-compliance with a compliance notice given by Centrelink).

The FWO may issue an infringement notice for contraventions of the PPLAct:

subsection 70(2) (unauthorised deductions from instalments)

subsections 72(1), (2) or (3) (when an employer pays instalments)

section 74 (method of payment of instalments payable by an employer)

section 80 (giving a person a record of a payment)

subsection 81(1) or (2) (keeping records), and

subsection 157(4) (non-compliance with a compliance notice given by the FWO).

Centrelink or the FWO is not under an obligation to issue a notice and has the discretion to manage the breach of the civil penalty provision in different ways.

As an alternative for dealing with a contravention of a civil penalty provision, Centrelink or the FWO has the discretion to give a compliance notice or to apply to the court for a civil penalty order in relation to the contravention.

Grounds for issuing a notice

In order to issue an infringement notice, Centrelink or the FWO must reasonably believe that the person has contravened one or more of the civil penalty provisions.

It is, therefore, very important that an alleged contravention of a civil penalty provision has been thoroughly investigated before a notice is issued.

Time limit for issuing an infringement notice

An infringement notice must be given within 12 months:

of the day on which the 14-day period specified in a compliance notice issued by Centrelink or the FWO ends (if the infringement notice relates to a compliance notice given by Centrelink or FWO under subsection 157(4) of the PPLAct), or

after the day on which the alleged contravention occurred.

There is a 12-month timeframe for issuing an infringement notice because not all contraventions of a civil penalty provision will immediately be identified.

Contents of an infringement notice

An infringement notice must:

be identified by a unique number

state the day on which it is given

state the name of the person to whom the notice is given and the name and contact details of the person who gave the notice, and that the person is an infringement officer for the purposes of issuing the infringement notice

give brief details of the alleged contravention, or each alleged contravention, to which the notice relates, including

the provision of the PPLAct that was allegedly contravened

maximum penalty that a court could impose for each contravention, if the provision were contravened, and

the time (if known) and the day of, and the place of, each alleged contravention

state the amount that is payable under the notice

explain how the payment of the penalty is to be made

state that the matter will not be dealt with by the Court if the penalty specified in the notice is paid within 28 days after the notice is given (or a longer period if extended by Centrelink or the FWO)

state that the payment of the penalty is not an admission of guilt or liability

state that the person may apply Centrelink or the FWO to have the payment period extended

state that the person may choose not to pay the amount but if they choose not to, proceedings seeking a civil penalty order may be brought against the person

set out how the notice can be withdrawn and state that if the notice is withdrawn, proceedings seeking a civil penalty order may be brought against the person, and

state that the person may write to Centrelink or the FWO seeking the withdrawal of the notice.

Extension of time to pay penalty

An employer who has been given an infringement notice may apply to Centrelink or the FWO for an extension of the prescribed period in which to pay the penalty. The application must be made before the end of the period specified in the infringement notice and Centrelink or the FWO may extend the period, in writing, before or after the end of the period.

Centrelink or the FWO may extend the period in which to pay the penalty more than once.

If the period in which to pay the penalty is not extended by Centrelink or the FWO, then the period in which to pay the penalty infringement is the later of:

the 28 days after the day that the notice is given, or

the day that is 7 days after the notice was given not to extend the payment period.

Amount of penalties in infringement notices

The table below indicates the amount of penalties that an infringement notice MUST specify in relation to a contravention of the relevant civil penalty provisions in the PPLAct, by a body corporate or persons other than a body corporate.

The amount of a penalty unit is specified in the

Crimes Act 1914

1.1.N.20 Nominal interest rate amount

Definition

The 'nominal interest rate amount' is one component making up the

PPLSC

payable for a person for an income year (

1.1.I.30

). The nominal interest rate amount is intended to compensate for forgone superannuation fund returns as a result of the PPLSC being paid annually.

The nominal interest rate amount is the base contribution (

1.1.B.05

) for the person for the income year multiplied by the

SG

charge percentage (

1.1.S.96

) for that year multiplied by the multiplier amount (

1.1.M.30

).

Example:

Francesca’s child is born on 19 July 2025. Centrelink determines that Francesa’s claim for

PLP

is effective and first pays a

PPL

funding amount to Francesca’s employer on 20 August 2025 to be paid to Francesca in alignment with her normal salary pay-cycle.

A total of $19,910.10 in PLP was paid for Francesca in the 2025–26 income year, which is her base contribution. The SG charge percentage is 12% for the 2025–26 income year.

On 31 August 2026, the Commissioner determines the amount of Francesca’s PPLSC for the 2025–26 income year and where the PPLSC is to be paid.

To calculate the nominal interest rate amount, the Commissioner first works out the multiplier amount as follows:

Step

Description

1

The number of days between 20 August 2025 (the first day a PPL funding amount was paid for Francesca) and 31 August 2026 (the day the Commissioner makes a determination) is calculated and equals 377 days.

2

377 is divided by 365, which equals 1.03287671232877.

3

1.03287671232877 is multiplied by 10% and rounded to 4 decimal places, which equals 0.1033.

The multiplier for the nominal interest rate amount is 0.1033.

The Commissioner then works out the nominal interest rate amount as follows:

Step

Description

1

Francesca’s base contribution of $19,910.10 is multiplied by the SG charge percentage of 12%, which equals $2,389.212.

2

$2,389.212 is multiplied by the multiplier amount of 0.1033, which equals $246.8055996.

The nominal interest rate amount is $246.8055996.

9.1 Payability & calculation of the PPLSC

Introduction

A

PPLSC

is payable in relation to children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025.

A person is eligible for a PPLSC for an income year (

1.1.I.30

) if

PLP

was paid to or for them in that year.

The Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) will generally calculate and pay a PPLSC in the subsequent income year.

PPLSC payability

A PPLSC is payable for a person for an income year if Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

):

paid a

PPL

funding amount (

1.1.P.180

) for the person to the person’s employer in that year, or

paid an instalment (

1.1.I.80

) directly to the person that was payable for that year.

Note:

Any PPL funding amount that is subsequently raised as a debt owed to the Commonwealth by the person’s employer in that year is disregarded when determining whether a PPLSC is payable.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115B Person for whom PPL superannuation contribution payable, section 168 PPL funding amount debts—amounts not paid as PLP instalments, section 63 Instalments of PLP, section 84 When the Secretary pays instalments, section 75 Payment of PPL funding amounts

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

6.3.1.20

PPL funding amount debts,

4.3.4

PPL funding amounts,

4.3.1

Instalments of PLP

PPLSC amount

The Commissioner determines the amount of a PPLSC payable for a person for an income year by adding together

the base contribution (

1.1.B.05

) for the person for that year multiplied by the

SG

charge percentage (

1.1.S.96

) for that year, plus the nominal interest rate amount (

1.1.N.20

) for the person for that year.

The SG charge percentage will be 12% from 1 July 2025.

The Commissioner must make this determination as soon as reasonably possible once they have sufficient information to determine the amount of PPLSC payable and where the PPLSC is to be paid.

Example:

Francesca's child is born on 19 July 2025. Centrelink determines that Francesa's claim for PLP is effective and first pays a PPL funding amount to Francesca’s employer on 20 August 2025 to be paid to Francesca in alignment with her normal salary pay cycle.

A total of $19,910.10 in PLP was paid for Francesca in the 2025–26 income year. The SG charge percentage is 12% for the 2025–26 income year.

On 31 August 2026, the Commissioner determines the amount of Francesca's PPLSC for the 2025–26 income year and where the PPLSC is to be paid.

First, the Commissioner works out the multiplier amount needed to calculate the nominal interest rate amount as follows:

Step

Description

1

The number of days between 20 August 2025 (the first day a PPL funding amount was paid for Francesca) and 31 August 2026 (the day the Commissioner makes a determination) is calculated and equals 377 days.

2

377 is divided by 365, which equals 1.03287671232877.

3

1.03287671232877 is multiplied by 10% and rounded to 4 decimal places, which equals 0.1033.

The multiplier for the nominal interest rate amount is 0.1033.

Then, the Commissioner works out the nominal interest rate amount as follows:

Step

Description

1

Francesca’s base contribution of $19,910.10 is multiplied by the SG charge percentage of 12%, which equals $2,389.212.

2

$2,389.212 is multiplied by the multiplier amount of 0.1033, which equals $246.8055996.

The nominal interest rate amount is $246.8055996.

Finally, the Commissioner works out the PPLSC payable to Francesca as follows:

Step

Description

1

Francesca’s base contribution of $19,910.10 is multiplied by the SG charge percentage of 12%, which equals $2,389.212.

2

The nominal interest rate amount of $246.8055996 is added to $2,389.212, which equals $2,636.02 (rounded up to the nearest cent).

The amount of PPLSC payable to Francesca is $2,636.02.

Where Centrelink has made an employer determination for a person and their employer, and a determination has been made that the person is payable, Centrelink generally will provide fortnightly

PPL

funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to the employer in advance of the pay roll cut-off for the instalment of

PLP

that is to be provided to the person. However, employers can elect to receive the PPL funds for the person in just 3 PPL funding amounts rather than fortnightly.

When does Centrelink provide PPL funding amounts to the employer?

An employer is required to provide PLP to their eligible employee if an employer determination has come into force for the employer and the person, and if the employer has been paid enough (

1.1.P.10

) by Centrelink to fund the instalment.

Centrelink transfers PPL funding amounts to the employer in either fortnightly or 6-weekly funding amounts irrespective of the employee's pay cycle (that is, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). The first transfer of funding amount to an employer could include multiple fortnightly or 6-weekly funding amounts if there is a component of arrears owing to the person.

Examples:

If the employee is usually paid one month in arrears, Centrelink will make fortnightly payments of PPL funding amounts to the employer in a manner that enables the required number of PPL funding amounts to reach the employer before the usual pay cycle cut-off day, so that the correct amount can be paid to the employee one month in arrears on the employee's usual pay day.

If the employer has requested PPL funding amounts be provided in 3 payments and the employee is paid monthly, a fortnight in arrears and a fortnight in advance, Centrelink will provide adequate PPL funding amounts before the usual pay cycle cut-off to fund the usual monthly payment. Each payment may include no more than 6 weeks' advance of the employee's instalments.

Obligations on Centrelink when an employer provides the PLP

Where an employer is required to provide PLP to an employee Centrelink must give the employer written notice of PPL funding amounts each time a PPL funding amount is deposited to their business' bank account. The notice must name the employee for whom the PPL funding amount has been paid, the amount of the PPL funding amount, the flexible PPL days (

1.1.F.70

) covered by the amount and the daily amount of PLP payable for each of the PPL days. If the employer has several employees receiving PLP, Centrelink provides details of the PPL funding amount deposited to the employer's account for each employee.

Obtaining information

Centrelink may require a person (including an employer) to provide information or produce a document for the purposes of:

determining whether a person has made an effective claim for PLP

determining whether a person is or was eligible or initially eligible for PLP - this might include information to verify claims of both PPL and special PPL claimants

determining whether PLP is or was payable to a person

determining whether PLP should be paid by an employer or Centrelink and, if through an employer, which employer

ensuring compliance by an employer with their obligations under the PPLAct, or

any inquiry or investigation into a matter listed above.

In relation to debts owed to the Commonwealth under the PPLAct, Centrelink can require the debtor, including an employer, to provide information or produce a document relevant to the debtor's financial circumstances or can require a person to provide information or produce a document that would help locate the debtor or that is relevant to the debtor's financial circumstances.

Centrelink may also require a person, including a representative of an employer, to attend an interview to give the required information.

4.2.1.10 Centrelink claim determination role

Introduction

Centrelink accepts and determines effective claims (

1.1.E.10

) for

PLP

. Generally, there is a 2-stage determination process as outlined below, to enable parents to lodge claims and make decisions about their care arrangements in advance of their child's birth or placement for adoption.

Initial eligibility determination

An initial eligibility determination may be made if Centrelink is satisfied that a claimant has provided sufficient information to enable a determination about their initial eligibility to be made in relation to the claim.

To determine that a claimant is initially eligible to receive PLP on one or more flexible

PPL

days, Centrelink must be satisfied that the person meets the work test (

1.1.W.30

), the income test (

1.1.I.20

) and that the person satisfies the Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

).

An initial eligibility determination is made on the assumption that the state of affairs known at the time of making the determination will not change. In addition, a claimant who has an initial eligibility determination must notify Centrelink of anything that causes or is likely to cause the claimant to cease to be eligible for PLP.

Employer determination

If Centrelink makes an initial eligibility determination for PLP for a person, and the conditions for making an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) are satisfied, then Centrelink must make an employer determination for the person and the person's employer that the person's employer is to provide PLP.

If Centrelink has not made an initial eligibility determination, but has made a payability determination that PLP is payable to the person, Centrelink must make an employer determination for the person and the person's employer if the conditions for making an employer determination are satisfied.

Centrelink is required to make an employer determination (that the person's employer is required to pay instalments) if the following conditions are met:

a payability determination or an initial eligibility determination is in force for the person

instalments are likely to be payable by the employer for at least 40 consecutive flexible PPL days that are weekdays

the person has, or will have been, employed by the employer for at least 12 months immediately before the expected

DOB

(where the claim is made prior to birth) or the later of the expected DOB and the day the child was born (where the claim is made after the birth)

the person has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for the child and is likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer for the duration of that period

the person is not initially eligible or payable for any flexible PPL days before the person’s continuous flexible period, and

the employer has an

ABN

.

The requirement to have been employed by the employer for at least 12 months prior to the DOB or expected DOB does not have to be met if:

a person’s employer has elected to provide PLP to that employee, or to a class of employees that include that person, and

the person has consented to the employer providing PLP to them.

If an employer determination is made for the person and their employer and if PLP is payable to the person, the employer will be funded for instalments payable by the employer under the employer notice (

1.1.E.85

) relating to the employer determination, and PLP will be provided to the person by their employer for those instalments in their usual pay cycle. Centrelink will provide PLP to the person for flexible PPL days that are payable to the person that do not fall within a continuous flexible period for the person.

If an employer determination will not be made for a person, and PLP is payable to the person, Centrelink will provide all PLP instalments directly to the person.

Payability determination

Centrelink must make a payability determination if a person has made an effective claim. Centrelink must be satisfied the person was or will be eligible for the relevant days. In addition, Centrelink must not determine that PLP is payable to a claimant until the claimant has verified the child's birth and declared that action has been taken to register the child's birth if the person is required to do so, or has provided proof of the child's entry into the person's care.

Changes to determinations

If Centrelink revokes an employer determination for a person and employer, Centrelink must give them a written notice advising of the decision. The notice must contain any information that may be prescribed in the PPL Rules.

Where Centrelink has made an employer determination for a person and their employer and Centrelink then varies, sets aside or revokes a person's payability determination, Centrelink must notify the employer in writing about the effect of the decision. If the effect is to change the person's continuous flexible period, the Centrelink notice must advise the different period and any other information prescribed by the PPL Rules. However, Centrelink is not required to give such a notice if the employer determination has previously been revoked.

6.3.1.20 PPL funding amount debts

Summary

If the amounts paid to an employer by way of

PPL

funding amounts exceed the amount paid by the employer to the person to whom an instalment is payable, a debt arises.

This debt is due to the Commonwealth by the employer. This includes any amounts that have been deducted or withheld from an instalment of

PLP

payable to the person.

If the employer does not pay any instalment amount to the person, then the total PPL funding amount paid to the employer, is a debt to the Commonwealth.

As soon as there is an excess PPL funding amount, this amount becomes a debt by the employer.

These arrangements apply to overpayments of PPL funding amounts or amounts that are mistakenly paid. This may occur because of administrative error or the revocation or setting aside of an employer determination.

Act reference:

section 168 PPL funding amount debts—amounts not paid as PLP instalments

1.4.3.20 Duty to invite claims or volunteer information

Volunteering information

As a general principle, Services Australia has no duty to volunteer information in relation to other entitlements. Generally, failure to provide such advice will not be treated as negligent.

Exception:

If there is a practice to provide such advice in the circumstances under consideration and the person concerned was aware of, and relied on, the practice.

Inviting claims

The question of negligence often arises if Services Australia fails to invite a person to claim a benefit. There is generally no negligent misstatement in these cases as Services Australia's actions in automatically advising applicants/recipients of their likely entitlements are entirely voluntary. Services Australia has never advertised or otherwise suggested that it has voluntarily assumed a strict duty to inform applicants/recipients of their entitlements unless individually approached by such applicants/recipients. The first difficulty for an applicant/recipient is to show that they were aware of Services Australia's practice and relied on that practice as a basis for their actions. Also, even if the applicant/recipient relied on this, they would have to show it was reasonable to rely on Services Australia's voluntary practice without querying whether they were entitled to another payment.

2.9 Maximum PLP entitlements

Introduction

A person is not eligible for

PLP

on a day if they have exceeded their maximum PLP entitlement for the child.

Maximum entitlement for a child

The maximum number of days that can be received for a child for all claimants for the child depends on the date the child was born or adopted:

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 100

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2024 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 110

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 120

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2026 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 130.

PPL

claimant – general

Generally, a PPL claimant who is not partnered at the time of their initial claim can be eligible for up to the maximum number of days for the child. If the person is partnered at the time of claim, some of the entitlement will be reserved for another claimant or claimants (usually the other parent or the partner of the parent), unless an exemption applies (see below). If a reserved period applies, the person can be eligible for up to a lesser number of days, outlined below.

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 the maximum number of days are:

if the person is not partnered at the time of claim – 100 days

if the person is partnered at the time of claim – 90 days, with the remaining 10 days reserved for another claimant or claimants.

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2024 the maximum number of days are:

if the person is not partnered at the time of claim – 110 days

if the person is partnered at the time of claim – 100 days, with the remaining 10 days reserved for another claimant or claimants.

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 the maximum number of days are:

if the person is not partnered at the time of claim – 120 days

if the person is partnered at the time of claim – 105 days, with the remaining 15 days reserved for another claimant or claimants.

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2026 the maximum number of days are:

if the person is not partnered at the time of claim – 130 days

if the person is partnered at the time of claim – 110 days, with the remaining 20 days reserved for another claimant or claimants.

PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances - general

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances can be eligible for up to the maximum number of days for the child for the applicable year in which they became primary carer for the child, whether or not they are partnered at the time of claim. The reserved entitlement does not apply to these claimants.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances who is partnered can choose to receive the whole entitlement for the child, or they may choose to share their PLP days with their partner (if their partner is eligible as a special PPL claimant). They and their partner cannot exceed the maximum number of days for the child.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances (and their partner where relevant) can receive the maximum entitlement of PLP for the applicable year, even if PLP has been paid to another person or persons for the child (for example, the birth mother).

Example:

Jane gives birth to her baby on 3 August 2026 and takes 45 days (9 weeks of her PLP entitlement) immediately after the birth. Jane then falls ill and is unable to care for the child. Her partner Charlie takes primary care of the child. Charlie makes an effective claim as a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances. Charlie can receive up to 100 days for the child, despite the fact that Jane has already received 45 days.

PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances – surrogacy arrangements

Gaining parents in surrogacy arrangements are subject to the reserved period. This is unlike other PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances where the reserved period does not apply.

If the claimant is not partnered at the time of their initial claim, they can be eligible for up to the maximum number of days for the child. If the person is partnered at the time of claim, some of the entitlement will be reserved for another claimant or claimants, unless an exemption applies.

Special PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances

A special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances may receive the remainder of the PLP entitlement not already received by previous claimants for the child, up to the maximum entitlement for the child.

Birth mothers relinquishing care of the child

Birth mothers can be eligible for the maximum PLP entitlement for the child for the applicable year in which the child was born, regardless of whether they were partnered at the time of claim, where they have relinquished care of their child for one of the reasons listed below:

as part of the process for the adoption of the child

because the child was born because of a surrogacy arrangement, or

because the child was removed from their care by a child protection agency of a state or territory, or in accordance with a decision of a court of a state or territory, under a law of that state or territory dealing with child protection.

Exemptions to the reserved period for partnered claimants

A person who is partnered at time of claim may receive an exemption to the reserved period if any of the following circumstance are met:

The partner of the person at the time of their claim is incapable of caring (

1.1.I.05

) for the child and has been, or is likely to be, incapable of caring for the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks.

The child, or another child born of the same multiple birth as the child, is stillborn (

1.1.S.90

) or has died.

The person is experiencing family and domestic violence, or is dealing with the impacts of family and domestic violence.

The partner of the person at the time of their claim is deployed outside Australia as a defence force member, under conditions specified in a determination made under the

Defence Act 1903

that relates to such deployment, for all of the flexible PPL days (

1.1.F.70

) for the child.

The child, or another child born of the same multiple birth as the child, was required to remain in hospital after the birth, or was hospitalised immediately after the birth and has been or is likely to remain in hospital for a period of at least 18 weeks.

The child, or another child born of the same multiple birth as the child, developed a complication or contracted an illness during the period of gestation, at birth or immediately following the birth and because of the complication or illness, the child has higher care needs, and requires medical care or treatment, for a period of at least 18 weeks.

These claimants can receive the remainder of the reserved entitlement for the child, up to the maximum PLP entitlement for the child.

Example:

A baby is born in September 2024 and both parents claim PLP for the child. As they are partnered at the time of claim they can be eligible for a combined maximum of 110 days, with the most one parent can take being 100 days. The father parent receives 2 days of PLP before passing away. The mother of the child can be eligible for the remaining 108 days of PLP for the child.

Claimants may be asked to provide evidence to Centrelink to support that they are eligible for an exemption. Appropriate evidence will vary from case to case.

A person separating from their partner after they have claimed PLP does not make them exempt from the reserved period.

1.2.2.20 Social security & other payments

Note:

On 1 October 2016, changes to the SSAct definition of 'ordinary income' came into effect. These changes mean that

PLP

is considered as income, which may reduce the amount of an income support or other payments that are payable to a person and/or their partner. This topic describes how these changes apply to associated government assistance payments.

Note:

People who receive PLP for a child born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 will receive a

PPLSC

. The PPLSC is not considered income for the purpose of income support or other payments and will not impact the amounts that are payable to a person and/or their partner.

Income support

From 1 October 2016, PLP is included as income for all income support payments (for example, parenting payment (single and partnered), jobseeker payment/youth allowance and

DSP

). This applies to claimants with children born or entrusted into their care on or after 1 October 2016, whether or not a claim for PLP was made before, on or after 1 October 2016.

Similarly, from 1 October 2016, PLP affects the rate of a person's service pension, veteran payment or income support supplement payable under the

Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986

including the exceptional circumstances relief payment and farm help income support provided through the

Farm Household Support Act 2014

.

In addition, where a person is eligible for PLP and is also on income support, from 1 October 2016, Services Australia will make PLP payments directly to that person in place of their employer (

5.1.1

).

Note:

According to the SSAct section 23(1) 'veteran payment' means a veteran payment made under an instrument made under section 45SB of the Veterans' Entitlements Act.

Act reference:

SSAct

section 8(1) Income test definitions, section 23(1)-'income support payment', section 23(1)-'veteran payment'

ABSTUDY

PLP paid in respect of children born or entrusted into care on or after 1 October 2016, is considered income for the purposes of the ABSTUDY personal and partner income tests. For the parental income test, PLP is taxable income and is therefore included in a person's

ATI

(

1.1.A.40

) in assessing entitlement to dependent ABSTUDY.

6.3.7 Departure prohibition orders

Introduction

Centrelink can make a

DPO

, preventing a person with a debt to the Commonwealth under this PPLAct from leaving Australia.

Making a DPO

Centrelink has the discretion to make a DPO in a case where all 3 conditions below are satisfied:

the relevant person has one or more outstanding

PLP

, family assistance or social security debts

they have not made satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge their debts, and

Centrelink believes it is desirable to make such an order to ensure that they do not leave Australia without wholly repaying their debts or making satisfactory arrangements to do so.

Before making an order, Centrelink must also take the following matters into account:

the person's capacity to pay debt/s

whether any debt recovery action has been taken and the outcome of the recovery action

the length of time the debt/s have remained unpaid (after the day on which it became due and payable), and

any other matters as it considers appropriate.

What constitutes a satisfactory repayment arrangement will depend on the facts of the case.

Centrelink cannot make a DPO unless all of these conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, as a DPO places significant restrictions on the debtor's freedom of movement, Centrelink will not make a DPO without considering all the relevant circumstances.

Note:

A DPO cannot be made against an employer for owing a

PPL

funding amount debt.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200A Secretary may make departure prohibition orders, section 168 PPL funding amount debts—amounts not paid as PLP instalments

Centrelink believes it is desirable to make a DPO

The purpose of a DPO is to secure payment of a person's debt owed to the Commonwealth. As such, Centrelink will not make a DPO unless there are grounds for the reasonable belief that making the order will make recovery of the debt more likely.

Situations where a DPO may be appropriate include:

The debtor is about to leave Australia - regardless of any plans to return.

The debtor is transferring assets offshore, either directly or indirectly (for example, borrowing funds overseas by securing Australian assets).

The debtor has resources, whether financial or otherwise, that would enable them to live offshore, such as family, assets, employment or a business.

Departure from Australia prohibited

A DPO made against a person will prevent them from leaving Australia before either discharging all their debts or making satisfactory arrangements to do so.

A DPO places significant restrictions on the freedom of movement of citizens and residents of Australia and visitors to Australia, and will not be made without consideration of all relevant circumstances.

A person must not depart Australia for a foreign country where they have:

a DPO in force, and the person knows that the order is in force (or is reckless as to whether the order is in force), and

the person's departure is not authorised by a

DAC

, and the person knows that the departure is not authorised by such a certificate (or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by such a certificate).

It is an offence for a person with a DPO in force departing Australia without a DAC. The penalty for such an offence is 12 months' imprisonment.

Note:

A DPO does not prohibit travel to Australia's external territories (for example, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island).

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200B Departure from Australia of debtors prohibited

Operation of DPOs

Once a DPO is made, generally it is in force from the time it is made until it is revoked or set aside by a court. However, Centrelink must revoke a DPO in certain circumstances, or may revoke or vary it in other circumstances (see Revoking a DPO below).

Centrelink can revoke or vary a DPO after becoming aware of new information or in response to representations made by the debtor.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200D Operation of departure prohibition order

Notification requirements to make, vary or revoke a DPO

Where Centrelink makes a DPO in respect of a debtor, it must notify:

the debtor to whom the DPO applies

the Australian Border Force

the Australian Federal Police, and

where the debtor is not an Australian citizen, the Department of Home Affairs.

Due to the consequences of a DPO, Centrelink will make every effort to ensure that the debtor receives a copy of the DPO as soon as possible after the order is made.

Where Centrelink makes a decision to vary or revoke a DPO, the person to whom the order applies and any other person to whom a copy of the order was provided must be notified. Centrelink must also notify the debtor where they have rejected the debtor's application to vary or revoke a DPO.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200C Notification requirements for departure prohibition orders, section 200F Notification requirements for revocations and variations

Revoking a DPO

Centrelink must revoke a DPO in any of the following circumstances:

The debts have been wholly discharged.

This condition is met when any combination of repayments, debt waivers or write-offs results in no portion of the debtor's debts being repayable.

Centrelink is satisfied that there are satisfactory repayment arrangements to wholly repay these debts.

A common-sense approach is required to determine whether arrangements are satisfactory in each case. A repayment arrangement that requires the presence of the debtor in Australia to function is not a satisfactory arrangement. Where the debtor has sold property and needs to leave Australia before settlement occurs, a garnishee notice (

1.1.G.10

) in relation to the known proceeds would be a satisfactory arrangement.

Centrelink is satisfied that debts will be completely irrecoverable.

A person's debt will be regarded as completely irrecoverable when there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to make any payment towards it. See

6.3.5.10

for further details.

Even when the tests outlined above are not satisfied, Centrelink has the discretion to revoke a DPO where they believe it is desirable to do so. Centrelink will exercise this discretion in a way that supports the purpose of the Acts.

Varying a DPO

Centrelink also has discretion to vary a DPO. They can only use this discretion to correct errors on the face of the order.

Centrelink will not vary a DPO to allow a social security debtor to depart Australia. Where Centrelink is satisfied that it is appropriate and necessary for a debtor to depart Australia, for a defined period, Centrelink will either revoke the DPO or issue a DAC.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200E Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders

Appeal & review

Appeals to the Federal Court or Federal Circuit Court

A person can appeal to the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court against the making of the DPO.

The court can either dismiss the appeal application or set aside the DPO. It can determine whether an order is properly made, but cannot exercise the administrative decision-making powers granted to Centrelink (

T v Federal Commissioner of Taxation

(1986) FCA 433

).

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200N Appeals to courts against making of departure prohibition orders, section 200P Jurisdiction of courts, section 200Q Orders of court on appeal

Review by the

ART

A person may apply to seek a review of Centrelink's decision by the ART in regard to:

revocation or variation of a DPO

issuing of a DAC, or

the provision of security, and the substitution of later days on a DAC.

The ART will undertake an independent merits review of the decision. The ART can exercise the discretions granted to the Secretary when reviewing decisions.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200R Review of decisions

Enforcement

Australian Border Force Officers and members of the Australian Federal Police are authorised to prevent the overseas departure of a person subject to a DPO.

If an officer believes that a person is about to depart from Australia when a DPO is in force and without a DAC, they can require the person to answer questions or produce documents.

A person is required to answer these questions, even if the answers may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty. However, their answers are not admissible in evidence against them except in relation to a prosecution for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200S Powers of officers of Customs and members of the Australian Federal Police, section 200T Privilege against self-incrimination, 200U Production of authority to depart

Offences

It is an offence for a person to depart from Australia for a foreign country:

knowing, or reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and

the person's departure is not authorised by a DAC, and the person knows the departure is not authorised by such a certificate, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by such a certificate.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

A person commits an offence if they fail to answer a question or produce the document and they are capable of doing so.

Penalty: 30 penalty units.

It is also an offence of strict liability if a person who has a valid DAC fails to produce the certificate at the request of an authorised officer.

Penalty: 5 penalty units

A person who provides false or misleading answers to questions commits an offence and can be prosecuted.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

An attempt to commit any of these offences is punishable as though the actual offence had been committed.

6.3.6.50 Waiver of debts - settlement of civil actions

Settlement of civil action

If the Commonwealth has agreed to settle a civil action against a debtor for recovery of a debt for less than the full amount of the debt, Centrelink must waive the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Settlement of proceedings before

ART

If Centrelink has agreed to settle proceedings before the ART relating to recovery of a debt on the basis that the debtor will pay less than the full amount of the debt, then Centrelink must waive the right to recover the difference between the debt and the amount that is the subject of the settlement.

Waiver where at least 80% of debt is recovered & debtor cannot pay more

The Commonwealth must waive the remaining 20% or less of the value of the original debt if:

at least 80% of the original value of the debt has been recovered by the Commonwealth

the Commonwealth and the debtor agree that the recovery is in full satisfaction for the whole of the debt, and

the debtor cannot repay a greater proportion of the debt.

Agreement for part payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

Centrelink and the debtor may agree that the debt will be fully satisfied by part payment of the outstanding amount. If this occurs, the debtor pays an agreed amount less than the outstanding amount of the debt, and Centrelink waives the right to recover the difference between the agreed and outstanding amounts.

Limits on agreement to accept part payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

Agreement for part payment in satisfaction of the outstanding debt can only be made if the agreed amount is at least the present value of the unpaid amount if it is repaid in instalments.

The present value of the unpaid amount is calculated as follows:

where:

annual repayment is the amount of the original debt Centrelink believes would otherwise be recovered through methods of debt recovery in a year

rp (repayment period) is the number of years needed to repay the unpaid amount if repayments equal to the annual repayment were made each year, and

settlement interest is the annual rate of interest.

6.1.3 Offences against Parts 7.3 & 7.4 of the Criminal Code Act 1995

Introduction

This section is about offences against

Criminal Code Act 1995

Parts 7.3 (Fraudulent conduct) and 7.4 (False or misleading statements).

If a person is convicted of an offence against Parts 7.3 or 7.4 of the Criminal Code in relation to the PPLAct, the court may impose a penalty and order the person to pay the Commonwealth an amount equal to any amount paid to, or in relation to, the person by way of an instalment of

PLP

or a

PPL

funding amount because of the act, failure or omission that constituted the offence.

Evidentiary effect of Centrelink's certificate

When the court orders the person to pay reparation to the Commonwealth as specified above, a certificate signed by Centrelink is evidence of the matters set out in the certificate. This certificate may specify to whom an instalment of PLP or a PPL funding amount has been paid, the amount paid, and the act, failure or omission that caused the amount to be paid.

Where the court makes an order and gives a certificate specifying an amount to be paid to the Commonwealth, and the certificate is filed in a court which has civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount to be paid, the certificate is enforceable as a final judgement of that court.

Penalty

If a person is convicted of more than one offence against the Criminal Code Parts 7.3 or 7.4 above in relation to the PPLAct, the court may impose one penalty for all the offences. That single penalty must not exceed the sum of the maximum penalties that could be imposed if a separate penalty were imposed for each offence.

Charges

More than one charge may be included in the one complaint, information or declaration if they are founded on the same facts or they form a series, or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. However, particulars of each offence charged are to be set out separately. If the charges are joined in this way, the charges must be tried together unless the court considers it just that any of them should be tried separately and makes an order to that effect.

7.1.5 Notice of internal review decision

Claimant decision

Once a review of a claimant decision (

1.1.C.110

) is completed the decision maker must notify the outcome by giving a written notice to:

the applicant who sought the review, and

any other persons whose interests are affected by the decision (other than the employer).

If the decision maker makes a decision that relates to a child the decision maker must give written notice of the decision to:

anyone who has made a claim in relation to the child, and

anyone who has notified that they intend to make a claim and the decision maker is also satisfied that the claim has or would have a reasonable prospect of success.

The notice may include the decision maker's reasons for the decision, findings of fact, and other evidence or material on which the decision was based. However, a notice that does not contain this material will still be valid.

Note:

The general expectation is that the decision maker would supply reasons for the decision, however Centrelink has discretion as to how much information or evidence they provide to each person whose interests are affected by the decision. While there would be no barrier to providing the applicant with a full set of reasons, the provision allows the decision maker to inform others affected by the decision of the decision itself without necessarily providing the reasons for the decision to all affected parties, where doing so may not be supported by the confidentiality provisions in PPLAct Division 3 or the

Privacy Act 1988

. In most cases, affected parties will be advised that a decision has been made, how it may affect them and, where appropriate, their options or rights.

The notice MUST include information about further review rights to the

ART

, except where the review decision relates to claimant decisions which are excluded from ART review (

7.2.1

).

Employers would only be notified of the outcome of a person's application for review of a claimant decision if it affected the employer's obligation to provide

PLP

. For example, if an employer determination is revoked the employer and the person must be notified of the decision or, if a decision is made to vary, set aside or revoke a payability determination, Centrelink must give the employer written notice.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 211 Internal review—notice of decision on review of claimant decision, section 215(2) However, this Division does not apply …

Employer decision

If the decision maker makes a decision (as a result of either an own-initiative review or a review following an application) about an employer funding amount (

1.1.E.80

), payment by instalments by employers, employer determination (

1.1.E.70

), compliance, or any other decision that directly affects the interests of an employer then the decision maker must give written notice of the decision to the employer concerned.

The notice must set out the reasons for the decision, findings by the decision maker on material questions of fact, and refer to the evidence or other material on which the findings were based.

If the review decision is about an employer funding amount decision or an employer determination decision, the notice MUST include a statement that the employer may apply to the ART for review of the decision.

5.2.1 Initial eligibility determinations for PLP

Introduction

An initial eligibility determination may be made where an effective claim for

PLP

has been made, and Centrelink cannot yet make a determination that PLP is payable to the claimant, for example, because the child has not yet been born and hence the birth has not been verified as required before a payability determination can be made.

Initial eligibility determination - claimant is not eligible

In making an initial eligibility determination, Centrelink may determine that a claimant is not eligible to receive PLP for one or more flexible

PPL

days if Centrelink is, at the time of making the determination, satisfied that there is no possibility of the person becoming eligible for PLP in respect of the child.

Example:

An expectant parent makes a claim for PLP one month before the expected

DOB

of their baby. The claimant has only worked for 3 of the past 13 months, and has no prospect of meeting the PPL work test by the time the baby is born.

Initial eligibility determination may be deferred

If at the time when an initial eligibility determination may be made, Centrelink is uncertain about whether a claimant will be eligible to receive PLP, Centrelink may defer making an eligibility determination.

Example:

An adopting parent makes a claim for PLP 2 months before the expected date of adoption. At the time the claim is made the claimant does not meet the Australian residency test, but expects to do so just before the child enters their care as part of the process of adoption. Centrelink may defer making an initial eligibility determination on the claim until after the claimant has met the Australian residency requirements.

Initial eligibility determination - claimant is initially eligible for PLP

If a person makes an effective claim for flexible PPL days (

4.1.1

), Centrelink may make an initial eligibility determination that the person is initially eligible for those flexible PPL days, if Centrelink is satisfied when making the determination that the person satisfies the:

work test

income test, and

Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

).

When the initial eligibility determination comes into force

An initial eligibility determination comes into force on the day it is made.

Notice of initial eligibility determination

If Centrelink makes an initial eligibility determination, Centrelink must give a notice of the determination to the claimant.

In all cases involving a notice of a decision, PPLAct section 306(4) provides that a decision is not ineffective just because the notice was not given or was given late, or the notice did not comply with the requirements of the provision.

Assumptions when making initial eligibility determination

In deciding whether to make an initial eligibility determination, Centrelink may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to Centrelink when making the determination will remain unchanged.

This does not prevent the actual state of affairs being looked at again when a payability determination is being made.

In addition, if a person makes an effective claim for PLP and Centrelink does NOT make a payability determination that PLP is NOT payable to the person, the person must notify Centrelink of anything that causes or is likely to cause the person to cease to be eligible for PLP on a day. A person commits an offence if the person refuses or fails to comply with the requirement.

1.1.P.130 Permissible break

Definition

Permissible breaks may occur either between 2 work days in the work test period (

1.1.W.40

) or at the beginning of the work test period.

A break between 2 days on which the person performed qualifying work (

1.1.Q.20

) (that is, a qualifying work day) in the work test period is a permissible break if there were no more than 84 consecutive days (equivalent to 12 weeks) between those 2 days.

Example:

If a person works for 3 months, takes unpaid leave for 10 weeks for a holiday, then returns to work for another 6 months before having the baby, the holiday would be considered as a permissible break, because it was only around 70 days in length.

A permissible break can also occur where:

a person has performed qualifying work on a day before the start of the work test period and they next perform qualifying work on a day after the first day of the work test period, and

the second qualifying work day is not more than 84 days after the previous qualifying work day.

Example:

A person's work test period starts on 1 February. They worked up until 15 January, went on unpaid leave and returned to work on 15 March. The period of consecutive days on which the person did not perform qualifying work between the first day in the work test period and the later qualifying work day (from 1 February to 14 March) is a permissible break because the number of days between the previous qualifying work day (15 January) and the later qualifying work day (15 March) is not more than 84 days.

Note:

For children born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process prior to 1 January 2020, a break between 2 qualifying work days is permissible if it was less than 56 consecutive days (8 weeks).

Note:

A person can count PLP days for a previous child as qualifying work for a new claim.

1.1.D.10 Daily national minimum wage amount

Definition

The daily

amount for a day is defined as 7.6 times the amount of the NMW (when expressed as a monetary amount per hour) set by a NMW order that is in operation on that day, irrespective of whether or not the order is also in effect on that day.

The daily NMW amount for a flexible

PPL

day applies from the day the determination is made and not the day the order takes effect (if it is an earlier day). The application date of 1 July is consistent with most of the indexation provisions present in family assistance law and the PPL income limit.

The amount of an instalment of

6.3.3 Interest charge on debts

Summary

From 1 January 2017, an interest charge will be applied to outstanding social security, family assistance, student assistance and

PPL

payment debts of former recipients who have failed to enter into, or have not complied with, an acceptable payment arrangement.

An interest charge will be applied to a person's debt from the day after the debt is due and payable, that is, on the 29th day after the date of the debt notice, where the outstanding debt has not been paid in full or the person has not entered into or is not complying with, a payment arrangement.

Exemptions apply where a person is in receipt of a social security or

FTB

payment. These recipients are required to repay their debts through deductions from their ongoing payments.

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

6.3.2

Notice of debts

Exemption from interest charge

The following people are exempt from the interest charge:

a person receiving a social security payment

a person receiving instalments of FTB at a rate above nil

a person receiving a veterans' pension, veteran payment or allowance

a person receiving

ABSTUDY

instalments that includes living allowance, and

a person receiving instalments under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme.

Exemptions are not available for those individuals with outstanding debts who only receive child care assistance and/or payments under the PPLAct. This is because automatic deductions are not able to be made from these payments to repay existing debts.

People on a nil rate of payment (for example, families who defer their FTB payments) are not automatically exempt from the interest charge.

Centrelink has the discretion to determine that an interest charge is not payable in special circumstances. This may include (but is not limited to) where Centrelink is satisfied the person has a reasonable excuse for failing to enter into, or for failing to make a payment under, a payment arrangement.

Note:

According to the SSAct section 23(1) 'veteran payment' means a veteran payment made under an instrument made under section 45SB of the

Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986

.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 178 Exemption from interest charge—general, section 179 Exemption from interest charge—Secretary's determination

SSAct

section 23(1)-'veteran payment'

Payment arrangements

An interest charge will not be applied to a debt where a person has, within 28 days of the date on the debt notice:

paid the debt in full

continued to make payments under an existing payment arrangement (where one is in place), or

contacted Centrelink to enter into an acceptable payment arrangement, made a payment under that arrangement and is continuing to comply with the arrangement.

The rate of the repayment instalment will be negotiated with Centrelink, and will be determined by the size of the debt and the time it would take to repay the debt as quickly as possible without causing severe financial hardship.

A debt may be written off for a specified period of time where recovery would result in the person being in severe financial hardship. The test for severe financial hardship is based on individual circumstances. The interest charge would not be applied during the period of the write-off.

When a debtor has capacity to repay by deductions etc.

Failure to comply with a payment arrangement

Where a person has entered into a payment arrangement and fails to make a scheduled payment under that arrangement, the interest charge will be applied to the debt until:

the debt is paid in full (including any interest charged)

any outstanding amounts due under the arrangement have been paid, or

the arrangement is terminated by Centrelink.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 175 Interest charge—failure to comply with or termination of debt payment arrangement

Termination of the payment arrangement

A payment arrangement may be terminated by Centrelink:

at the person's request

after giving 28 days' notice to the person of the proposed termination, or

without notice, if Centrelink is satisfied that the person has failed to disclose material information about their true capacity to repay the debt.

Where a payment arrangement is terminated, to avoid the interest charge being applied to a person's debt/s, they will have 14 days to either repay the debt and any interest charged or enter into an acceptable payment arrangement, make a payment under that arrangement and continue to comply with the arrangement.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 190 Payment of debts by arrangement, 190A Secretary may determine amounts to be deducted from instalments payable to debtor, section 175 Interest charge-failure to comply with or termination of debt payment arrangement

Calculation of an interest charge

The rate of the interest charge is the 90‑day Bank Accepted Bill rate published by the Reserve Bank of Australia (

Interest Rates and Yields - Money Market - Monthly - F1.1

), plus an additional 7%, as is applied by the

ATO

for tax debts (

General interest charge (GIC) rates

). The interest charge will be updated quarterly.

The interest charge is compounded on a daily basis and is applied to the debt monthly, during the period that the debt remains unpaid or until an acceptable payment arrangement is entered into, a payment is made under that arrangement and the arrangement continues to be complied with.

4.3.8.30 Employer determination for PLP comes into force after review

Introduction

Centrelink is required to pay instalments to a person if their employer has sought a review of the employer determination and the employer determination has not come into force before the 28th day after the start of the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) (

4.3.6.20

).

However, where an employer determination subsequently comes into force, the instalment period for the last instalment payable by Centrelink ends on the day before the employer determination comes into force (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)).

The first instalment period payable by the employer starts on the transfer day. This does not affect when the instalment period ends.

These rules ensure continuity of payment for the person but also make clear when Centrelink's responsibility for paying an instalment stops and the employer's starts, by reference to a transfer day.

2.4.3 NARWP for PLP

Summary

Migrants who are granted a permanent visa or a temporary partner visa on or after 1 January 2019 are required to serve a

NARWP

of 104 weeks before they can receive

PLP

. A NARWP also applies to claimants for certain social security payments,

FTB

Part A and farm household allowance.

There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP. These are detailed in this topic.

For more information on the NARWP for other payments, please refer to SS Guide

1.1.N.70

, SS Guide

3.1.2.40

and FA Guide

2.2.1.10

.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 31A Newly arrived resident's waiting period

Application of the NARWP

A person is subject to a NARWP for PLP if on or after 1 January 2019 they:

become the holder of a visa determined by the Minister for the purposes of SSAct subparagraph 729(2)(f)(v) of the SSAct, or

become the holder of a permanent visa (with some exceptions - see below).

The NARWP for PLP does not apply to a person who:

becomes the holder of a specified Orphan Relative (subclass 117 or 837) or Remaining Relative (subclass 115 or 835) visa (or a kind of visa determined by the Minister), or

was the holder of a temporary Partner (Provisional) or Partner visa (subclass 309 or 820) at any time before 1 January 2019 before being granted a permanent visa.

A person is not eligible for PLP in respect of a day on which the NARWP applies. This means that a person is not able to receive PLP in respect of a child until they have completed the NARWP.

Generally, the NARWP must be completed prior to the birth of the child in order for a claimant to be eligible for PLP. If the person was subject to the NARWP on the date the baby was born, they are generally not eligible for PLP, unless a NARWP exemption applied on that day (see below for exemptions).

For

PPL

claimants in exceptional circumstances or their partner, and special PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances the NARWP must be completed prior to the day the claimant in exceptional circumstances became the primary carer of the child.

General exemptions

PLP claimants are exempt from the effect of the waiting period if they meet one of the following criteria - this means that they may still be eligible for PLP despite the NARWP applying in respect of the day if:

the person holds or was a former holder of a visa of a subclass included in a determination made by the Minister under SSAct subsection 739A(6) on that day

the person is a refugee, or a former refugee (within the meaning of SSAct subsection 7(6B)) on that day

the person is a family member of that other person on that day or, if that other person has died, the person was a family member of that other person immediately before that other person died

the person is an Australian citizen on that day, or

the person is residing in Australia and holds an SCV on that day or has held a

SCV

at any time before that day.

A person is not eligible for PLP for any days in the NARWP where an exemption does not apply.

For information on the visa subclasses specified under SSAct subsection 739A(6), please refer to SS Guide

3.7.1.20

.

Receiving an income support payment exemption

In addition, the NARWP will not apply to PLP claimants in the circumstances outlined below where the person has been receiving an income support payment.

The NARWP will not apply to claimants for PLP for a flexible PPL day if:

on the day before the flexible PPL day the person was receiving

a social security pension or social security benefit (within the meaning of the SSAct)

farm household allowance (under the

Farm Household Support Act 2014

(FHSAct)), or

PLP for the child, and

the person was also receiving one of the above payments on the day of the child's birth.

Additionally, the NARWP will not apply to claimants for PLP for a period of flexible PPL days if:

the person has made a claim for a period of at least 10 consecutive flexible PPL days that consist only of weekdays, and

on the day before the start of that period the person was receiving:

a social security pension or social security benefit (within the meaning of the SSAct)

farm household allowance (under the FHSAct), or

PLP for the child, and

the person was also receiving one of the above payments on the day of the child's birth.

The NARWP will not apply to the claimant for the period of flexible PPL days, including any weekend days in that period.

Example 1:

Duong, Mai and their daughter, Phuong, are granted permanent visas under the Skilled stream in August 2023 and are subject to a 104-week NARWP for PLP. One year later, Duong becomes ill and is no longer able to work. Mai has also been working but has recently stopped as she is pregnant and nearing her due date. Duong and Mai have minimal savings and are in hardship. They both claim and are granted special benefit (SpB) as Duong's illness and inability to work constitute a substantial change in circumstances. Shortly after, Mai gives birth to their second child and claims 18 weeks of flexible PPL days on continuous weekdays. Mai is otherwise eligible for PLP and is receiving SpB on the day of the birth, and on the day before the first flexible PPL day claimed. Mai is exempt from the NARWP for PLP and can receive this payment for her second child.

Example 2:

Ellen is granted a permanent skilled visa in September 2022. After arriving in Australia, she commences a relationship and becomes pregnant in September 2023. Ellen leaves the relationship after experiencing domestic violence. She claims SpB and is granted an exemption from the NARWP for SpB as this constitutes a substantial change in circumstances. Provided she meets the other eligibility requirements, Ellen will be able to claim PLP for a flexible PPL day if she is receiving SpB on the day of the child's birth, and either SpB or PLP on the day before the flexible PPL day.

Example 3:

Maria has a baby on 1 August 2023. Maria and her partner Jack are serving a NARWP, but start receiving SpB on 15 August 2023 after Jack loses the job he had organised prior to coming to Australia. Maria and Jack apply for PLP on 25 August 2023 with an intention for Maria to take 12 weeks of flexible PPL from 25 August 2023 until 17 November 2023, and for Jack to take the remaining 8 weeks of flexible PPL. As neither Maria or Jack were receiving an income support payment on the day of the child's birth, neither are eligible for an exemption from the NARWP, and both are therefore not eligible for PLP.

Example 4:

Angelique is granted a temporary partner visa in January 2022 and is subject to a NARWP. Her partner Phillippe is an Australian citizen. Phillippe loses his job in April 2023 and starts receiving jobseeker payment (JSP). Angelique claims and starts receiving SpB from 1 May 2023. Angelique is pregnant and has a baby on 1 August 2023. Angelique and Philippe apply for PLP on 26 August 2023 with an intention for Angelique to take a 12 weeks of flexible PLP from 26 August 2023 until 17 November 2023, and for Philippe to take the remaining 8 weeks of flexible PPL. Angelique started receiving SpB before the birth of her baby and continued to receive it up until the day before her first flexible PPL day. She is therefore exempt from the NARWP. Philippe is not subject to a NARWP as he is an Australian citizen. Both Angelique and Philippe will be able to receive PLP, if they meet all other requirements.

Example 5:

Maria came to Australia on a permanent carer visa to look after her father in March 2022. Maria claims

CP

and is granted an exemption from the NARWP as a carer visa holder. Her partner Roberto, came to Australia on a permanent skilled nominated work visa in July 2022 to take up a job. The company Roberto works for goes into liquidation and Roberto loses his job unexpectedly on 1 July 2023. Roberto applies for and is granted SpB as the loss of his job constitutes a substantial change in circumstances which exempts him from the NARWP for SpB.

Maria gives birth to their first child on 2 August 2023. Roberto is caring for the child from the date of birth while Maria continues to care for her father. Roberto applies for PLP on 10 August 2023. Maria gives permission for Roberto to claim 18 weeks of flexible PPL. Roberto is exempt from the NARWP for PLP as he was receiving SpB on the day before his flexible PPL days as well as on the DOB of the child. Roberto is able to receive 18 weeks of PLP.

Transitional arrangements

The NARWP for PLP applies to people granted a permanent visa or relevant temporary visa on or after 1 January 2019. People who were granted a permanent visa or relevant temporary visa (under SSAct 729(2)(f)(v)) before 1 January 2019 are not required to serve a NARWP for PLP or DAPP. This applies even if they are granted a visa before 1 January 2019 but do not arrive in Australia until after 1 January 2019.

The NARWP for PLP does not apply to a person for a child who:

is born either before 1 January 2019 or in the 6 months from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, or

becomes entrusted to the care of a person (as mentioned in subsection 275(2) of the PPLAct) either before 1 January 2019 or in the 6 months from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019.

Example 6:

Austin and Sarah are granted permanent skilled visas on 5 January 2019. Sarah is pregnant and gives birth in May 2019. The NARWP for PLP does not apply for this child as it is born before 30 June 2019.

Duration of the NARWP

A NARWP for PLP is usually 104 weeks in duration. The length of a NARWP, how it is calculated and who it applies to depends on the date of a person's arrival in Australia and the benefit they apply for. Only time a visa holder is physically present in Australia will count towards the NARWP.

Example 7:

Alison, who resides in Australia, was granted a permanent visa on 10 February 2019. Alison went to England to visit her parents for 4 weeks in April 2019. The time Alison is not physically in Australia will not be counted towards her 104-week NARWP for PLP. Alison will have to wait an additional 4 weeks (28 days) before she will have served her NARWP.

is subject to the NARWP in any other circumstance (and neither of the above points apply)

their NARWP begins on the later of the date the person arrived in Australia or the date the permanent visa was granted and ends when the person has been in Australia for a period of, or periods totalling, 104 weeks after that day.

See Example 9.

Note:

The specified visas in items 1 and 2 of the above table are temporary Partner visas: subclasses 309 and 820. From 1 January 2019, people who are granted one of these temporary partner visas are subject to a 104-week NARWP for PLP; however, the period on the temporary visa contributes to serving the NARWP if the person is subsequently granted a permanent visa. People granted a temporary partner visa before 1 January 2019 are not subject to a NARWP for PLP while they hold the temporary partner visa or if they are subsequently granted the permanent visa.

Example 8:

On 6 March 2019, Andrew applies for temporary and permanent Partner visas (subclasses 820 and 801). On 14 June 2020, he is granted the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) so he can continue to live with his partner Alice in Australia. Andrew will remain on the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) while his application for the permanent Partner visa (subclass 801) is processed. While on the temporary visa, Andrew is not residentially qualified for most welfare payments, except SpB and family payments (including FTB and PLP); however, he must serve a NARWP before he can access these payments except for FTB Part B, which has no waiting period. The temporary Partner visa subclass 820 is a specified visa under paragraph 739A(3)(b) and paragraph 739A(4)(b) of the SSAct. This means the NARWP for SpB, FTB Part A and PLP begins from the date Andrew applied for the temporary Partner visa. The period Andrew spends in Australia following his application counts towards the NARWP for these payments, which will end on 6 March 2020 for FTB Part A, 6 March 2021 for PLP and 6 March 2023 for SpB, provided Andrew remains in Australia throughout this period. On 24 March 2022 Andrew is granted a permanent Partner visa (subclass 801). A 208-week NARWP will apply for most other welfare payments (for example, JSP) from the day he is granted the permanent visa. However, for SpB and family payments, the time Andrew has spent on the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) will count towards the NARWP for his permanent Partner visa. Therefore, on the date Andrew is granted his permanent visa, he will have completed the NARWP for FTB Part A and PLP and have less than a year left to serve of the NARWP for SpB, and can then access these payments if eligible during the NARWP for other payments.

Example 9:

Andie lives in Canada and is granted a permanent Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme visa (subclass 187) on 24 July 2019 after being nominated by an Australian employer for a job in regional Australia. She moves to Australia on 2 November 2019. Andie is subject to the NARWP. As Andie's visa was granted offshore, the NARWP starts once she comes to Australia. She must wait, from 2 November 2019, 52 weeks before she can receive FTB Part A, 104 weeks for PLP and 208 weeks for most other income support payments (unless she meets the qualification for an exemption to the NARWP).

2.5.2 Caring for a child for PLP - exceptional circumstances

A parent of the child who is not the birth mother, or a partner of a parent of the child

In usual circumstances the parent of the child who is not the birth mother, or a partner of a parent of the child may be eligible for

PLP

on days they are caring for the child. Permission to make a claim is required from the birth mother or in some cases from an adoptive parent.

The

PPL

Rules prescribe the exceptional circumstances (

1.1.E.100

) in which the other parent of a child or the partner of either parent may claim PLP without permission from the birth mother or adoptive parent.

Other carer for the child

A person who is not a parent of the child and is not intended to become the parent via adoption, and is not a member of a couple with a parent of the child at the time of claim, may be a claimant for PLP where they began caring for the child in exceptional circumstances. The PPL Rules prescribe the particular circumstances and eligibility criteria that apply to enable them to receive PLP.

Exception:

Formal non-parent carers, where there is a placement of a child with the carer under formal child protection processes, are not eligible for PLP (but may be eligible for

FTB

and

NBS

). This applies to situations where there has been placement action by the relevant state/territory child protection authority acting under the state or territory child protection legislation or a decision by a court in relation to child protection in the state or territory. This may include placement of the child with a relative or significant other person, or the placement of a child in a formal foster care arrangement.

In order to make an effective claim as a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances or special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, a person must have become the primary carer of the child before the child’s first birthday, and expect to have care of the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks. A person is the primary carer of a child when they are the person who is primarily responsible for meeting the child’s needs.

In addition, in order to be eligible on a flexible PPL day, the person must be caring for the child (

1.1.C.10

).

1.1.G.30 Guidance & appeals panel

Definition

The guidance and appeals panel provides a mechanism for escalating significant issues and addressing material errors in

ART

decisions. The guidance and appeals panel is a way of constituting the ART for review at a more senior level. The guidance and appeals panel can:

hear and determine a matter referred to it by the President of the ART that raises an issue of significance to administrative decision-making, and

review and determine ART decisions referred to it by the President of the ART that may contain an error of fact or law materially affecting the decision or that raise an issue of significance to administrative decision-making.

Matters and decisions can be considered by the guidance and appeals panel where the President of the ART refers them to the panel on their own-initiative or upon application by one of the parties to an ART decision. However, applications for a review by the guidance and appeals panel can only be made for ART decisions related to ART reviewable employer decisions (

7.1.1 Own-initiative reviews

Introduction

If satisfied there is sufficient reason to do so Centrelink may, on its own initiative, review a decision made by an officer under the PPLAct.

Centrelink must not, on its own initiative, review a decision to make an employer determination (

1.1.E.70

). A decision to make an employer determination can only be reviewed if requested by the employer. Centrelink can also revoke an employer determination if the conditions under which an employer determination can be revoked are met (

5.1.8

).

Centrelink may initiate a review of a decision:

whether or not a person has applied for a review, and

even if an application for review has been made to the

ART

.

Having reviewed the decision, Centrelink may affirm or vary the decision or set aside the decision and substitute a new decision.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

5.1.8

Revocation of an employer determination for PLP

Own-initiative review where an ART review has been requested

Own-initiative reviews resulting in a decision being varied or substituted after an application for ART review can impact the ART review.

Under the PPLAct, Centrelink can vary or substitute a decision after an application has been made for ART review of the decision, in which case the decision as varied or substituted is the one reviewed in place of the original decision.

However, this generally only applies to the initial ART review, after an application is made for second review the relevant decision cannot be altered outside of the Tribunal process unless:

the parties to the proceeding for the review consent to the alteration and the ART, by order, consents to the alteration, or

the ART remits the decision to the decision-maker for reconsideration.

Likewise, if the President of the ART refers an application for ART review to the guidance and appeals panel the decision cannot be altered outside of the above, unless an application was made to the President of the ART to refer an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel but the ART has not yet been constituted for the purposes of the proceeding in relation to the application. In such a case the decision can be varied or substituted and the decision as varied or substituted is the one reviewed in place of the ART's earlier decision.

If, on an own-initiative review, Centrelink affirms or varies the decision, or sets aside and substitutes a new decision, and at that time the claimant or employer had applied to the ART for a review of that decision, Centrelink must give a written notice of the decision to the ART Principal Registrar.

4.3.5.40 Employer obligations under industrial instruments or laws not affected by PPL scheme

Employer obligations

To avoid any doubt, the PPLAct clarifies that an employer's obligation to provide

PLP

is separate and additional to any other obligation the employer has in relation to the person, regardless of how those other obligations may arise (for example, an obligation arising under another law of the Commonwealth, a state or territory law, or an industrial instrument).

Note:

A person can elect when in the period from the

DOB

(or adoption) to the day before the child's second birthday they wish to receive their flexible

PPL

. If the person is an employee, they can take their PLP before, after or at the same time as any employer-provided paid or unpaid leave they may be entitled to receive.

Example:

If an employee is entitled to receive a benefit (such as paid leave) under a law or industrial instrument (including, for example, a contract of employment or an enterprise agreement), the employer has an obligation to provide that entitlement for the life of the agreement. An obligation under an industrial instrument or law is separate from and in addition to an employer's obligation to provide Government-funded PLP.

Introduction

days, Centrelink must also make an employer determination (

PLP

provided by their employer are met. Where an employer determination is not made, PLP instalments will be paid directly to the recipient through Centrelink.

5.1.2 Notice of employer determinations for PLP

Introduction

If Centrelink makes an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

), Centrelink must give the employer and the person written notice that the employer determination has been made.

The notice given to the person that an employer determination has been made must identify the employer.

The notice given to the employer must contain the following information:

the name of the person claiming

PLP

whether a payability decision has been made

the person's continuous flexible period for the child (

1.1.C.145

)

the date the preparation of the notice was completed.

This information will identify the person and whether there has been a payability determination and give the employer enough information to know when the employer is likely to have to pay instalments to the person.

If Centrelink decides not to make an employer determination, Centrelink must give the person written notice advising of the decision.

The interest charge rate is the daily interest rate that is applied to debts, calculated by adding 7 percentage points to the base interest rate (

1.1.B.10

) for that day, and dividing that total by the number of days in the calendar year.

The base interest rate is based on the 90-day Bank Accepted Bills published by the Reserve Bank of Australia, using data from a prescribed month in the prior quarter. If no new rate is available, the last published rate is used.

1.1.B.05 Base contribution

Definition

The 'base contribution' is used to derive the amount of one of the 2 components of a

PPLSC

for an income year (

1.1.I.30

).

Essentially, it is the amount of

PPL

paid/payable to a person in the relevant income year.

It is the sum of

all PPL funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) paid in the income year by Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

) to an employer and all payable instalments (

1.1.I.80

) paid in the income year by Centrelink directly to the PPL recipient.

Note:

When calculating the base contribution, the amount taken to be paid in an instalment includes any amount deducted from that instalment (see

4.3.2

for circumstances where deductions can occur). The amount considered in the base contribution is 'before deductions'.

4.1.10 Claims for PLP & SBP for the same child

Introduction

This topic explains the arrangements that apply when a claimant lodges a claim for both

PLP

and

SBP

for a stillborn child.

PLP and SBP cannot both be paid for the same child.

A claimant who meets the eligibility requirements for both PLP and SBP for a child may choose which payment is the best financial decision for their family. A claimant is not prevented from lodging a claim for both payments, but a claimant is able to decide which payment is right for them before lodging a claim, and to lodge a claim for one or the other payment.

Where an individual claims PLP and they or their partner have also claimed SBP for the same child, the Secretary must defer the determination of the SBP claim. The SBP claim cannot be determined until one of the following occurs.

If a determination has been made that PLP is payable for the child

the instalment period that relates to the first PLP payable day has ended

the payability determination is revoked

the claim for PLP is rejected (that is, the individual is not eligible for PLP), or

the claim for PLP is withdrawn (that is, the individual elects to receive SBP).

If the individual does not advise that they wish to withdraw their PLP claim, the PLP determination will be made when a payability determination is made on a flexible

PPL

day and the SBP claim will be rejected. If the flexible PPL days are revoked, the SBP claim can be determined.

Where a person makes a claim for PLP and is notified that PLP is not payable for the child either after the period of 52 weeks beginning on the day of the birth of the stillborn child, or in the last 13 weeks of that 52 week period, that person can claim SBP in the 13 weeks after the day that notice is given.

A person will not be eligible to receive SBP for a child if PLP is payable to them or their partner (or their former partner when they were a couple).

Where a person or their partner receives SBP and later decides to claim PLP for the child, any SBP paid for the child will be raised as a debt once a payability determination is made on a flexible PPL day.

4.3.7.10 Payment of arrears of PLP - employer determination reviewed or revoked before coming into force

Introduction

Centrelink must pay instalments (

1.1.I.80

) to a person in circumstances where the employer (

1.1.E.50

) has applied for review of an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) and the employer determination has not come into force before the 28th day after the start of the person's continuous flexible period (PPLAct subsection 84(3)). In this situation, Centrelink must pay instalments from the instalment period that includes the 28th day after the start of the person's continuous flexible period or a later instalment, and starts before the day (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)) on which the employer determination comes into force, if the employer determination comes into force at all.

If an employer determination is revoked under PPLAct subsection 84(4), Centrelink must pay the instalments of

PLP

from the

PPL

instalment period that begins on or after the day the revocation comes into force (the transfer day).

In either of these situations, Centrelink must also pay the person instalments that are payable from the start of the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) on the payday for the first instalment period that Centrelink is required to pay instalments under subsection 84(3) or 84(4) (

4.3.6.20

and

4.3.6.30

).

8.2.2 Correspondence nominees

Mail directed to a third person

A 'correspondence nominee' may be appointed by Centrelink to receive mail from Centrelink on behalf of the

PLP

recipient (principal) to assist the recipient in their dealings with Centrelink.

Full consideration should be given to the individual circumstances of the proposed principal to ensure that a nominee arrangement is the correct arrangement.

Centrelink must not appoint a correspondence nominee without the written consent of the person to be appointed.

Appointment of a correspondence nominee

Centrelink may appoint a person (or a body corporate) in writing to be the correspondence nominee of another person (the principal) for the purposes of PLP. The nominee may only be appointed if they accept the appointment and their obligations under

PPL

law in writing. Letters giving notice of the nominee appointment are to be sent to both the principal and the nominee. The same person may be appointed as both the payment nominee and the correspondence nominee, but this is not required. In appointing a nominee, Centrelink must take account of the wishes of the principal.

5.2.2.60 General provisions for payability determinations

Assumptions

In deciding whether to make a payability determination, Centrelink may act on the assumption that the state of affairs known to Centrelink when making the determination will remain unchanged.

This does not prevent Centrelink from reviewing the determination if Centrelink becomes aware that the state of affairs has changed or was in fact different at the time that the determination was initially made.

When a determination is in force

A payability determination comes into force on the day it is made and continues to be in force unless it is revoked under PPLAct section 25, or set aside under PPLAct Chapter 5.

Notice of a payability determination

If Centrelink makes a payability determination for

PLP

, Centrelink is required to give a notice of the determination to the claimant, stating:

whether PLP is payable

if PLP is payable for one or more flexible

PPL

days for the child - those days

if PLP is not payable - whether a conditional eligibility determination has been made, and

that the claimant may apply for review of the determination in the manner set out in PPLAct Chapter 5.

In all cases involving a notice of a decision, PPLAct subsection 306(4) provides that a decision is not ineffective just because the notice was not given or was given late, or the notice did not comply with the requirements of the provision.

Revoking determinations on request

A claimant may request a revocation of their payability determination that PLP is payable.

If a payability determination has been made that PLP is payable to a person and the person requests Centrelink to revoke the determination in a manner approved by Centrelink, and the request is made before the last day of the instalment period for a flexible PPL day, then Centrelink must revoke the determination.

The revocation is taken to have come into force on the day the person requested Centrelink to revoke the determination.

5.2.2.50 When a payability determination finds that a person is not payable for PLP

Introduction

In order for a payability determination to be made that

PLP

is payable to a person for a flexible

PPL

day for a child, a person must:

be eligible for PLP on the relevant day, and

make an effective claim for PLP for that day.

Even if these 2 requirements are met, Centrelink cannot make a determination that PLP is payable for a flexible PPL day if:

the child's birth has not been verified

PLP was or is payable for another child in a multiple birth

the person would only be payable for PLP on the basis that they are a COVID-19 affected claimant for PLP for a child born after 31 March 2021, or

another person is payable for the flexible PPL day and the maximum number of flexible PPL days have already been taken by more than one person concurrently.

Child's birth has not been verified

Centrelink cannot make a payability determination that PLP is payable to a person for a child unless a PPL claimant has verified the child's birth (

1.1.V.10

).

An effective claim for PLP that is made from 3 months prior to the expected

DOB

does not need to be accompanied by birth verification for the child for Centrelink to make an initial eligibility determination or a determination that the person is not payable for PLP.

Note:

If an effective claim is lodged in this period, the birth should be verified within 56 days after the expected DOB of the child.

Note:

A PPL claim that is lodged after the child's actual DOB must be accompanied by birth verification. If a person makes an online claim they may satisfy this requirement by providing the birth verification to Centrelink (by post or in person) at around the same time they lodge their claim online.

Birth verification for a newborn child is satisfied if the person:

provides proof of the child's birth

is a parent of the child (other than an adoptive parent)

the child was not stillborn

the person is responsible under state or territory law for registering the birth of the child, and

the person gives Centrelink information showing that

the child's birth has been registered under the state or territory law, or

action has been taken to register the birth under the state or territory law.

Birth verification for a newborn child may be provided by either a birth verification form approved by Centrelink, or a birth certificate.

The birth verification form approved by Centrelink is the 'Newborn Child Declaration' form (FA081) that is usually issued to parents by the hospital or midwife following the birth of a child. The form includes the hospital's or midwife's certification that the child was born. The form also allows the claimant to provide information that the child's birth has been registered or action has been taken to register the birth.

States and territories have primary responsibility for birth registration. Requirements relating to notification and submission of a registration statement are provided in the laws of the individual states and territories. Generally, hospitals are required to notify the Registry of the birth within 21 days of the birth of the child, and parents are required to submit a statement to the Registry within 60 days of the birth of the child.

If a child is stillborn (

1.1.S.90

), verification of the stillbirth may be provided in a form approved by Centrelink. The birth verification form approved by Centrelink is the 'Claim for Bereavement Payment' form that is usually issued to parents by the hospital. The form includes certification that the child was stillborn. There is no requirement to register the birth of a stillborn child for the purposes of a claim for PLP. If the stillbirth has been registered the birth certificate may be provided as verification.

An adoptive parent may provide adoption papers to Centrelink as proof that the child has entered the person's care as part of the process of adoption.

A person who is a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances will be required to provide proof to Centrelink that the child has entered their care. The form of proof that is available will depend on the individual circumstances of the case.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 6 The Dictionary, section 18 The child's birth has not been verified, section 275 How this Act applies to an adopted child, section 276 How this Act applies to claims made in exceptional circumstances

Multiple births

Centrelink must not make a payability determination that PLP is payable to a person for a child if the child and another child are born in the same multiple birth event, and PLP is or was payable to the person or another person for another child born in the same multiple birth event.

This restriction applies even if children born in the same multiple birth event are being cared for within different families, for example, as the result of their parents separating.

NBS

may be available for other children born in the same multiple birth event.

In the case of adopted children, where 2 or more children were adopted as part of the same multiple adoption, PLP may only ever be payable in respect of one of the children adopted as part of the same multiple adoption.

NBS may be available for other children adopted during the same multiple adoption.

Work test period for COVID-19 affected claimants for PLP

Limit on number of flexible PPL days for which PLP is payable to more than one person (concurrency)

Generally, a person may be payable on a day on which another person is already payable for PLP, up to the maximum number of days as specified below:

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 the maximum number of days that can be claimed at the same time for a child is 10.

For children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 the maximum number of days that can be claimed at the same time for a child is 20.

However, a person may be payable on a day on which another person is already payable for PLP for more than the maximum number of days noted above if:

as a result of any of the following applying, it would be unreasonable to count the day towards the total of concurrent PPL days

the birth parent underwent a caesarean delivery or developed a complication or medical condition in connection with the child’s birth

the child was required to remain in hospital after the child’s birth, or was hospitalised immediately after the child’s birth and the child has been or is likely to remain in hospital for a period of at least 14 days

the child developed a complication or contracted an illness during the period of gestation, at birth or immediately following the birth and because of the complication or illness, the child has higher care needs and requires an extended period of medical care or treatment, or

the claimant is affected by a severe medical condition

the child is stillborn or has died

the child was born as part of a multiple birth (including twins), or

any other reason that Centrelink is satisfied would make it unreasonable to count the day towards the total of concurrent PPL days.

Claimants may be asked to provide evidence to Centrelink to show that one of these circumstances applies to them.

Complication or illness contracted during gestation, at birth or immediately following the birth resulting in higher care needs and extended period of medical care or treatment

For it to be considered unreasonable to apply a limit on concurrency because of a complication or illness of the child, the complication or illness must result in care needs that are higher than that expected following the birth of a child, as well as an extended period of medical care or treatment.

The existence of a complication or illness does not in and of itself satisfy the exception.

Example:

Isla and Jacques' newborn son Milo was born with a hearing impairment. Milo is seen by a specialist, however, he does not require ongoing medical support or treatment and does not have higher care needs as a result. While Milo’s hearing impairment is considered a complication, it would not be reasonable to apply an exception in this case.

Example:

Carlos and Mia’s daughter Katy was born with spina bifida, requiring Katy to undergo an operation and ongoing specialist care for a prolonged period post birth. Due to Katy’s condition Carlos and Mia need to provide their daughter with a lot of care. It is considered unreasonable to apply a limit on concurrency in this case so Carlos and Mia are able to take additional PLP days together to care for Katy.

Example:

Benito develops pneumonia following birth. As a result, Benito is on special medication and needs to be closely monitored, temporarily resulting in higher care needs. The pneumonia resolves within a week which is not considered to be an extended period of medical care or treatment. Therefore, Benito’s circumstances are not considered unreasonable and the maximum number of days in which PLP can be taken together does apply to his parents.

finishes at the end of the last day on which the unpaid amount or general interest charge on any unpaid amount remains unpaid.

Example:

On 31 July 2026 the Commissioner pays a PPLSC of $3,017.78 to a superannuation provider for crediting to a person’s account. The correct amount was actually a PPLSC of $2,636.02 for the year. On 7 September 2026, the Commissioner sends a notice to the superannuation provider stating that the overpaid amount of $381.76 is to be recovered, with a due date of 5 October 2026.

The overpaid amount of $381.76 is recovered on 30 October 2026, after the due date. The superannuation provider is liable to pay general interest charge on the amount for each day in the period beginning 5 October 2026 (the day the amount was due) and ending on 29 October 2026 (the last day that the amount remained unpaid). The general interest charge amount must also be paid on 30 October 2026.

7.1.2.10 Internal review of a claimant decision

Introduction

A person whose interests are affected by a claimant decision (

1.1.C.110

) may apply for an internal review of the decision. A person who can apply for a review of a claimant decision may include a

PPL

claimant or special PPL claimant, or other affected person, but not an employer.

Exception:

A person may NOT apply for an internal review of a claimant decision that was made personally by a PPL agency representative (

1.1.P.160

). In this case they may apply for a review to the

ART

.

A claimant decision is a decision of an officer, including determinations that the Secretary is taken to have made, made under the PPLAct, but not including decisions which deal with:

the payment of instalments by employers

employer determinations

compliance.

Note:

If a claim is not effective, the claimant can seek review only of the decision that the claim is not effective and not whether

PLP

was payable as this is unable to be determined without an effective claim. The claimant also may claim again for PLP.

Review of a decision that PLP is not payable to a person would result in the person not being paid PLP until the review is finalised. If the outcome of the review is that the claimant is eligible and PLP is payable, Centrelink may commence payments to the claimant. The payments can be in accordance with the claimant's initial claim.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 11C For a determination to be made, the person must claim, section 55 When a claim is effective, section 206 Internal review—application for review of claimant decision, section 216 ART review of claimant decision—application for review

Form of application for internal review of a claimant decision

An application for review of a claimant decision may be made orally or in writing to Centrelink.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 206(4) A person whose interests are affected by a claimant decision may apply to the Secretary …

Timing of application for internal review of a claimant decision

Applications for review of claimant decisions may only be made within 28 days of the day the decision in contention was made, unless Centrelink is satisfied that a longer period is appropriate.

Example:

A partnered birth mother makes a claim for PLP. They meet all eligibility criteria and reports their

ATI

(for the reference income year) to be $180,000, exceeding the individual income limit. Their partner’s income is $250,000, so together they would also exceed the family income limit. The birth mother is advised that they are not eligible for PLP as their income is too high. Eight months later, when preparing their tax return for the reference income year, the birth mother's accountant asks if they have claimed PLP. The accountant calculates the birth mother's ATI (for the reference income year) to be less than the relevant PPL income limit and they realise that they had incorrectly reported their ATI. Although the 28 day time limit has passed the birth mother can still seek review on the basis that their actual ATI is below the relevant PPL income limit because they did not become aware of this until 8 months later.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 206(5) Internal review—application for review of claimant decision

Notice of decision on review of a claimant decision

Written notice is required when a decision is made on an internal review of a claimant decision. See

2.7.1 Special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances

Introduction

Claims from special

PPL

claimants (

1.1.S.55

) in exceptional circumstances are generally made in respect of unusual situations, where a previous claimant for the child is no longer capable of caring for the child, or where Centrelink is satisfied that it is in the interests of the child to be cared for by the special PPL claimant.

A special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances can receive the remainder of the

PLP

entitlement for the child not taken by previous claimants for the child, up to the maximum entitlement:

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 100

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2024 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 110

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 120

for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2026 the maximum number of days that can be received for a child is 130.

PLP is not payable to a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances unless there is a determination that PLP is payable to a PPL claimant for the child in force.

A special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances does not need permission from another person to make an effective claim.

General eligibility criteria for special PPL claimants

To be eligible for PLP on a flexible PPL day, a person who is a special PPL claimant must:

meet the Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

) on that day and on the day the person became the primary carer of the child

be caring for the child unless

they are temporarily unable to care (

1.1.T.50

), or

they have lost care of the child (

1.1.L.30

), and

not be performing paid work for more than one hour on the day, unless

they have lost care of their child without their consent

they are performing paid work on a day because they have to comply with a summons or other compulsory process to give evidence or information, or to produce documents or other things

they have been recalled to duty (

1.1.R.05

) as a defence force member or law enforcement officer, or

the person returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency and they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker (

1.1.E.95

).

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

Note:

Special PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances are not required to meet the work test or income test requirements in order to be eligible for PLP.

Note:

For special PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances, a reference to the child’s date of birth is a reference to the day the person became the primary carer of the child.

Note:

Claimants can receive PLP concurrently with employer-provided paid leave (for example, recreation leave, employer-provided parental leave) and unpaid leave.

Special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances - partner of the birth mother, partner of an adoptive parent, the other parent or their partner

A person can claim PLP as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances if they are one of the following people:

the partner of the birth mother

the partner of an adoptive parent

a parent of the child that is not the birth mother, or

the partner of the parent of the child that is not the birth mother.

All the following criteria must also be met for a person claiming as a special PPL claimant:

the child is in their care and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks

they are, or are likely to become, the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or if that child is adopted before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child for adoption

on the day the child came into the care of the person, the child is not entrusted to the care of the person or their partner under a decision by a child protection agency, or by a court of a state or territory, under a law dealing with child protection, and

the birth mother or adoptive parent (as relevant) is incapable of caring for the child (

1.1.I.05

) and has been, or is likely to be, incapable of caring for the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks.

Special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances – other people

All other people can claim PLP as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances if:

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks

they became or are likely to become the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or if that child is adopted before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child for adoption

on the day the child came into the care of the person, the child was not entrusted to the care of the person or their partner under a decision by a child protection agency, or by a court of a state or territory, under a law dealing with child protection, and

either

the birth mother and their partner (if any), adoptive parent and their partner (if any) or PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances (as relevant) are incapable of caring for the child and have been, or are likely to be, incapable of caring for the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, or

Centrelink is satisfied that

the person became the primary carer in special circumstances

it would be unreasonable for the birth mother and their partner (if any), adoptive parent and their partner (if any) or PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances (as relevant) to care for the child (

1.1.U.10

), and

taking into account the arrangements for the child's care with the person in comparison with those in the child's pervious family situation, it is in the interests of the child (

1.1.I.90

) for the person to care for the child.

Example:

The child's parents both made successful claims for PLP as PPL claimants. Then 2 weeks after the child’s birth, when both parents had used 2 weeks of PLP each, both parents were killed in a car accident. The child's aunt took on care of the baby. She had not been working for long enough to meet the PPL work test and claim PLP in her own right as a PPL claimant, but she was able to successfully claim the remaining balance of PLP as a special PPL claimant up to the maximum entitlement.

Special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances – previous PPL claimant

A person can claim PLP as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances if:

the person has previously been a PPL claimant for the child

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks

they became or are likely to become the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child for adoption

on the day the child came into the care of the person, the child was not entrusted to the care of the person or their partner under a decision by a child protection agency, or by a court of a state or territory, under a law dealing with child protection, and

either

another person was a PPL claimant or special PPL claimant for the child in exceptional circumstances and those circumstances have ceased to apply, or

another person was a PPL claimant or special PPL claimant for the child in exceptional circumstances is incapable of caring for the child and has been, or is likely to be, incapable of caring for the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks.

Example:

The child's mother had received 2 weeks of her PLP when she was involved in an accident. The mother was hospitalised and in a coma with her future life expectations very uncertain. The child's father became the child’s primary carer and took leave from work. The child's father did not meet the PPL income test so could not claim PLP as a PPL claimant in normal circumstances. The father successfully claimed the remaining PLP for the child as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances. Ten weeks later, the mother had recovered enough to resume primary care of the child. She received the remaining PLP entitlement as a special PPL claimant.

Special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances – where there has been a previous special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances

A person can claim PLP as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances if:

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks

they became or are likely to become the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child for adoption

on the day the child came into the care of the person, the child was not entrusted to the care of the person or their partner under a decision by a child protection agency, or by a court of a state or territory, under a law dealing with child protection, and

either

the previous special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances is incapable of caring for the child and has been, or is likely to be, incapable of caring for the child for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, or

Centrelink is satisfied that

the person became the primary carer in special circumstances

it would be unreasonable for the previous special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances to care for the child, and

taking into account the arrangements for the child's care with the person in comparison with those in the child's pervious family situation, it is in the interests of the child for the person to care for the child.

1.1.I.70 Initial eligibility determination

Definition

An initial eligibility determination may be made where an effective claim for

PLP

has been made, but Centrelink cannot yet make a determination that PLP is payable to the claimant. For example, initial eligibility determinations may be made on claims lodged prior to the birth or adoption, when proof of birth or entry into care cannot yet be provided and if it is not yet known if the person will have care of the child for PLP purposes.

An initial eligibility determination can be made if Centrelink is satisfied that:

the flexible

PPL

days for the child are specified in an effective PPL claim (

1.1.P.165

) or special PPL claim (

1.1.S.55

)

the person satisfies the work test and income test when making the determination (if no other initial eligibility determination is in force in relation to the person and child), and

the person satisfies the Australian residency test when making the determination.

1.1.Q.20 Qualifying work

Definition

A person performs qualifying work on a day if the person either performs at least one hour of paid work (

1.1.P.20

) on a day, or the person takes a period of paid leave of at least one hour on a day.

Paid leave has its ordinary meaning, and generally includes paid recreation, maternity, carer's or sick leave, or unpaid leave while receiving workers' compensation or accident compensation payments. Paid out leave (for example, a payment in lieu of annual leave or long service leave that is paid out to an employee on termination of their employment) is not qualifying work.

From 1 July 2020, any payable flexible

PPL

days for a previous child can also count as qualifying work for a new claim.

A person also performs qualifying work on a day that is in a jobkeeper payment period or COVID-19 Australian Government payment (

1.1.C.166

) period for the person. The COVID-19 disaster payment is the only payment currently classified as a COVID-19 Australian Government payment.

A person is taken to have performed 7.6 hours of work on a week day, and no hours of work on a Saturday or Sunday that is in a jobkeeper payment period or COVID-19 Australian Government payment period. If a person performs at least one hour of paid work or takes at least one hour of paid leave on a day that is in a jobkeeper payment period or COVID-19 Australian Government payment period, the person is taken to have performed the greater of the hours of work performed or paid leave taken, or 7.6 hours on a week day and no hours on a Saturday and Sunday.

4.3.3 Payment of instalments of PLP by employer

Introduction

This section explains payment of instalments of

PLP

by employers (

1.1.E.50

). An employer is required to pay an instalment to a person if:

an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) has come into force for the employer and the person

the instalment is payable to the person in relation to a flexible

PPL

day for the child that falls within the person's continuous flexible period for the child (

1.1.C.145

), and

the employer has been paid enough by Centrelink to fund the instalment.

Centrelink pays PPL funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to employers to ensure that they have been paid enough to fund an instalment.

Employers have obligations relating to paying instalments. Payment of PLP does not affect or replace any other obligations the employer has in relation to the person.

2.6.1 PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances – parent of the child or partner of a parent of the child

Introduction

The PPL Rules prescribe the conditions whereby a person who is the parent of the child (who is not the birth mother) or a partner of a parent of the child may claim

PLP

as a

PPL

claimant in exceptional circumstances.

Eligibility criteria

A person who is the parent of the child (who is not the birth mother) or a partner of a parent of the child can be eligible for PLP, if they meet the core PPL requirements (

2.1

) relating to:

the work test (

1.1.W.30

)

the income test (

ATI

(

1.1.A.40

)), and

Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

).

They must also:

be caring for the child, unless

the child was stillborn or has died

they are temporarily unable to care for the child (

1.1.T.50

), or

they have lost care for the child (

1.1.L.30

), and

not be performing more than one hour of paid work on the day unless

the child is stillborn or has died

they have lost care of the child without their consent

they are a defence force member or law enforcement officer and they have been compulsorily recalled to duty

they have performed work because they had to comply with the requirements of a summons or other compulsory process to give evidence or information, or produce documents or other things, or

they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker (

1.1.E.95

) and they returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency.

A PPL claimant cannot be eligible for a flexible PPL day that exceeds their maximum PLP entitlement (

2.9

).

A person does not need permission to claim in order to make a PPL claim in exceptional circumstances.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances may give permission to claim PLP to their partner as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances.

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

Exceptional circumstances criteria

A person who is a parent or a partner of a parent of the child can claim PLP as a PPL claimant under exceptional circumstances if:

the person became the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or before the first anniversary of the placement of the child for adoption, and

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, and either

the birth mother or adoptive parent or parents (as the case requires) are incapable of caring for the child (

1.1.I.05

) and are expected to remain so for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, or

Centrelink is satisfied on reasonable grounds that

the person became the primary carer in special circumstances

it would be unreasonable (

1.1.U.10

) for the birth mother or adoptive parent or parents to care for the child, and

it is in the interests of the child (

1.1.I.90

) for the person to care for the child.

4.3.6.10 Employer determination for PLP never made

Introduction

Where Centrelink has never made an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) for the person and the person's employer (

1.1.E.50

), Centrelink must pay the person the instalment of

PLP

that is payable to the person on the payday for the instalment.

Centrelink is taken to have complied with the obligation to pay an instalment on a particular day if Centrelink pays the instalment before that day, or as soon as practicable after that day if Centrelink cannot pay the instalment on that day.

Situations in which an employer determination is never made could include where the person is self-employed, or they are no longer employed, or they are employed but the conditions for making an employer determination are not met.

2.3 PPL scheme income test for PLP

Introduction

A person satisfies the income test for

PLP

if any of the following are met:

the person's

ATI

for the reference income year (

1.1.R.10

) is not more than the relevant individual

PPL

income limit (

1.1.R.35

)

if the person does not have a partner at the time of their initial claim for PLP – the person’s ATI for the reference income year is not more than the relevant family PPL income limit (

1.1.R.30

), or

if the person has a partner at the time of their initial claim for PLP – the total of the following amounts is not more than the relevant family PPL income limit:

the person’s ATI for the reference income year, and

the ATI of the person’s partner for the reference income year.

The individual PPL income limit (

1.1.I.55

) and family PPL income limit (

1.1.F.10

) are subject to indexation on 1 July each year.

If a person satisfies the work test and income test requirements on the day a payability determination is made that the claimant is not payable, then the claimant is conditionally eligible for flexible PPL days for the child (

1.1.C.143

).

7.2.6 Appeals to Federal Court & references of questions of law

Introduction

A party to a proceeding in relation to an

ART

reviewable decision (

1.1.A.02

or

1.1.A.03

) can appeal to the Federal Court on a question of law from the decision of the ART in the proceeding. A person may also appeal to the Federal Court a decision that their interests are not affected by a reviewable decision.

Note:

The decision of the President about whether to refer an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel cannot be appealed to the Federal Court.

When & how an appeal can be made

The appeal to the Federal Court must be made:

if the ART is required to give a statement of reasons for the decision or a person has the right to request one and does so, 28 days after the ART gives the person the statement of reasons

if a person has the right to request a statement of reasons but does not do so, 28 days after the last day they could have made the request

in any other circumstance, no later than 28 days after the person is given the decision.

To make an appeal the person must file a notice of appeal in the manner prescribed by the Federal Court Rules. The relevant forms are available on the Federal Court’s website.

A person wanting to apply for an extension to the 28 day time limit may apply to the Federal Court.

Division 33.2–Administrative Appeals Tribunal

Operation & implementation of the ART decision while a Federal Court appeal is ongoing

Generally, an appeal to the Federal Court does not affect the operation of the ART decision or prevent Centrelink taking action to implement the decision.

However, the Federal Court may choose to make an order staying the operation or implementation of the ART decision, in part or in full, to ensure the effectiveness of the hearing and determination of the appeal.

The stay order may specify specific conditions and remains in force for either a stated period or until the decision on the appeal is given. It may also be varied or revoked by the Federal Court.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 178 Operation and implementation of Tribunal’s decision

Referring questions of law

In addition to a person appealing to the Federal Court, the ART may, with the agreement of the President of the ART, refer a question of law arising during an ART review to the Federal Court for decision.

The ART may do so either at its own initiative or at the request of one of the parties to the ART review.

Once a question of law has been referred, the ART must not give a decision to which the question is relevant while the reference is still pending, or proceed in a manner or make a decision that is inconsistent with the opinion of the Federal Court on the question.

8.2.1 Payment nominees

When a payment nominee might be used

A person (the principal) who is receiving or is to receive

PLP

directly from Centrelink and who wants their payment to go to another person on an ongoing basis can request the appointment of a 'payment nominee'.

Centrelink may appoint a payment nominee in other circumstances, although only after taking into consideration the wishes (if any) of the proposed principal regarding the making of such an appointment. Full consideration should be given to the individual circumstances of the proposed principal and other avenues of payments to a third party to ensure that a payment nominee arrangement is the correct arrangement for the principal, bearing in mind that the principal must be caring for the child (

1.1.C.10

) to remain eligible for PLP.

In practice, a person who is eligible for PLP is unlikely to be in a situation where payments should be directed to a nominee. If a nominee is needed, it may be likely that the person is unable to provide enough care for the child to meet the

PPL

eligibility requirement to be caring for the child. The more appropriate course of action may be for the other person to claim PLP, depending on the circumstances surrounding the ongoing care of the child.

Similarly, when responding to a third party requesting information regarding the recipient's payments, it may be more appropriate to consider the release of information under other provisions of the PPLAct rather than by appointing a nominee.

Appointment of payment nominee

Centrelink may appoint a person (or a body corporate) to be the payment nominee of another person (principal) for the purposes of PLP. The appointment must be in writing and Centrelink may direct that the whole or a specified part of each instalment of PLP be paid to the nominee. The nominee may only be appointed with their written consent indicating their acceptance of appointment and their understanding of obligations under PPL law.

Letters giving notice of the nominee appointment are to be sent to both the principal and the nominee. The same person may be appointed as both the payment nominee and the correspondence nominee, but this is not required. In appointing a nominee, Centrelink must take account of the wishes (if any) of the principal.

Payment of instalments to payment nominee

Payments to nominees must be to an account maintained by the nominee or as directed by Centrelink.

Instalment payments to a nominee are taken to be payments to the principal.

Centrelink may give a notice under PPLAct section 289 to the payment nominee of a principal, requiring the nominee to give Centrelink a statement about a matter relating to the disposal by the nominee of an instalment of PLP, paid to the nominee on behalf of the person.

Act reference:

4.3.5.30 Employer required to notify Centrelink if certain events happen in relation to PLP

Introduction

If Centrelink makes an employer determination for a person and an employer, then the employer is required to notify Centrelink if one of the events listed below occurs:

the employer's bank account details change

the person's instalment period (

1.1.I.80

) changes

the person's pay day changes

the payroll cut-off for instalments payable to the person changes

the employer becomes aware that they (the employer) is ceasing, or is likely to cease, to carry on a business

the person performs more than one hour of paid work for the employer at any time during the person’s continuous flexible period

the person ceases to be employed by the employer before the end of the person's continuous flexible period

the employer does not pay an instalment the employer is required to pay to the person

the employer is not paid enough to fund a particular instalment at the payroll cut-off for the instalment

the employer is not paid the agreed PPL funding amount

a PPL funding amount paid to the employer is for a greater amount than it should be for the number of days for which the PPL funding amount has been paid, or

the sum of the funding amounts paid to the employer for the person is more than the sum of amounts of the instalments that are payable by the employer to the person.

These events are relevant:

to whether the employer is required to pay an instalment

to the payment of PPL funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

)

to the payment by the employer of instalments of

PLP

, and

to whether an instalment of PLP is payable to the person.

A notice, in a manner approved by Centrelink, must be given as soon as practicable after the employer becomes aware that the event has happened. In the case of ceasing, or being likely to cease, to carry on a business, notice must occur as soon as practicable, but, not more than 30 days before the event.

A failure by an employer to comply with these notification provisions may result in a financial penalty.

An employer's obligation to notify of the events listed above ceases to apply if the event happens on or after the earliest of the following days:

if the employer determination comes into force and

is not revoked - the day after the person's continuous flexible period ends, or

is revoked - the day the revocation comes into force.

if the employer determination never comes into force, the day Centrelink, instead of the employer, becomes required to pay instalments to the person.

9.3.3 PPLSC infringement notices

Introduction

An infringement notice may be served on a superannuation provider (

1.1.S.98

) where the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) reasonably believes that the provider has failed to properly give the

ATO

a statement in relation to returning an underpaid amount (

1.1.U.05

) or a

PPLSC

that can’t be credited to an account.

The PPLAct sets out the provisions regarding these ‘PPLSC infringement notices’, including when they can be served, what is to be included in one and under what circumstances an infringement notice may be withdrawn.

Note:

Section 159 of the PPLAct, which deals with PPL infringement notices generally, does not apply to PPLSC infringements, which are treated separately, under Division 3 of Part 3 of the PPLAct.

Note:

Division 3 of Part 3 of the PPLAct provides the Commissioner with discretion to serve PPLSC infringement notices, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the superannuation provider has committed an offence. However, a superannuation provider’s liability to be prosecuted for an offence is not affected by a relevant infringement notice not being served or it being withdrawn. It is also not affected if the superannuation provider does not comply with the infringement notice. Division 3 of Part 3 also does not limit the amount of the penalty that may be imposed by a court on a person convicted of an offence.

Act reference:

PPLSC offences & penalties

Multiple offences & notices

A PPLSC infringement notice must not relate to more than one offence unless the offences involve refusing or failing to comply with a requirement before a specified time or period and are multiple daily offences involving the continued refusal or failure to comply.

More than one infringement notice is not able to be served on a superannuation provider for the same offence/s.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115T(2) An infringement notice must not relate to more than one offence …, section 115X More than one infringement notice may not be served for the same offence

Crimes Act 1914

section 4K Continuing and multiple offences

When an infringement notice can be served

A PPLSC infringement notice does not have any effect unless it is served within one year after the day on which the earliest of the offences is alleged to have been committed.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115T(3) An infringement notice does not have any effect unless …

Things included in an infringement notice

An infringement notice must state:

the name of the person on whom it is being served

that it is being served on behalf of the Commissioner

the nature of the alleged offence/s

the time (if known), date and place at which the earliest of the offences is alleged to have been committed

the maximum penalty that a court could impose for the alleged offence/s

the penalty that is payable for the alleged offence/s

that, if the person does not wish the matter to be dealt with by a court, they must pay the penalty amount specified in the notice to the Commissioner within 28 days after the date of service of the notice

that the person may write to the Commissioner seeking withdrawal of the notice.

Note:

The infringement notice may also contain any other matters considered necessary.

The penalty amount specified in the infringement notice is 20% of the maximum amount of the fine or fines that a court could impose for the offence/s.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115U Matters to be included in an infringement notice

Period for payment of penalty

While an infringement notice must state that the superannuation provider has 28 days to pay the penalty, the Commissioner may, by writing, extend this period on a case-by-case basis. The Commissioner can extend the period before or after the end of the 28-day period.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115Z Commissioner may extend period for payment of penalty

Withdrawing an infringement notice

A superannuation provider served with an infringement notice may write to the Commissioner seeking withdrawal of the notice.

Regardless of whether the superannuation provider has written to the Commissioner, the Commissioner may withdraw an infringement notice by serving them with written notice of the withdrawal within the time the penalty is required to be paid.

When deciding whether to withdraw an infringement notice, the Commissioner may consider the following:

whether the superannuation provider has previously been convicted of an offence for a contravention of the PPLAct

the circumstances in which the offence/s specified in the notice are alleged to have been committed

whether the superannuation provider has previously been served an infringement notice and paid the penalty in that notice

any written representations made by the superannuation provider.

Note:

The Commissioner may consider other matters that may be relevant.

If an infringement notice is withdrawn after the superannuation provider has already paid the penalty within the allowed time period, then the Commissioner must refund the entire amount paid.

1.4.3 Duty of care

Introduction

This section explains duty of care in the context of the PPLAct. This applies to any advice given and/or any actions performed.

What does duty of care mean?

Australian Government employees have a duty of care to the public when performing their duties. This extends to any advice given and/or any actions performed.

Breaches of duty of care

A breach of duty of care can result from negligent advice and/or a negligent action or failure to advise or act.

Compensation can only be paid if

DSS

, Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

) or the

ATO

has breached its duty to exercise reasonable care.

The payment is made under section 23 of the

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

(PGPA Act).

Act reference:

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

section 21 Non corporate Commonwealth entities, section 23 Power in relation to arrangements and commitments

Decisions under

PPL

law

The majority of decisions made under PPL law are decisions that are subject to a right of review. Challenges to decisions made under the PPL law may be resolved by review, rather than being settled under section 23 of the PGPA Act. Therefore, if negligent advice is given and/or a negligent action occurs, it will rarely result in a breach of a common law duty of care requiring settlement under section 23 of the PGPA Act.

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

Part 7

Review of decisions for PLP,

9.4

PPLSC decisions & reviews

Contributory negligence

Contributory negligence may arise if Centrelink or the ATO gave negligent advice and/or acted negligently, and either the person affected by the negligence or a third party also contributed to the negligence. In such a case, a reduced payment could be made to compensate for that part of the loss that resulted from Centrelink's or the ATO's negligence.

Loss because of taxation liability on arrears payments

The

Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

allows for a 'lump sum payment in arrears' tax offset (formerly called a rebate) on arrears of income payable to a recipient for previous financial years. The tax offset applies retrospectively to payments made on or after 1 July 1986 and includes assessable pensions, benefits and allowances under the SSAct, the

Veterans' Entitlement Acts 1986

and

PLP

under the PPLAct.

The tax offset is designed to alleviate the problem of more tax being payable in the year in which the lump sum is received than would have been payable if the lump sum had been taxed in each of the years in which it had accrued.

If a person seeks compensation for a loss in these circumstances, they should first be referred to the ATO for clarification of their entitlement to this tax offset. It may be that after application of the tax offset, no economic loss may exist.

If the tax offset does not apply, or does not relieve the person of the additional taxation liability in full, the claim should be considered under section 23 of the PGPA Act. If it can be accepted that the taxation liability in question arose from Centrelink's negligence, then the claim may be settled under that direction. If no negligence occurred, the matter may still be considered under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment Caused by Defective Administration.

9.2.3 Return of a PPLSC or underpaid amount

Return of an amount that cannot be credited to an account

If a trustee (

1.1.T.100

) of a complying superannuation fund (

1.1.C.141

) or provider (

1.1.P.275

) of an

RSA

(

1.1.R.50

) does not credit a

PPLSC

or an underpaid amount (

1.1.U.05

) to an account of a person within 28 days of receiving the amount, the trustee or provider is liable to repay the PPLSC or underpaid amount to the Commonwealth.

The trustee or provider must give the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) a statement in the approved form (

1.1.A.77

) at the time when the PPLSC or underpaid amount is repaid. Failure to do so is an offence (

The Commissioner may recover an amount a trustee or provider is liable to pay as a debt (

1.1.D.50

) due to the Commonwealth.

PPLSC offences & penalties

General interest charge

If a trustee or provider is liable to repay a PPLSC or underpaid amount, the amount is due 7 days after the day they first became liable to repay the amount.

The trustee or provider will be liable to pay general interest charge (

1.1.G.15

) on any amount that remains unpaid after this due date.

General interest charge will be applied for each day during the period that:

starts at the beginning of the day the unpaid amount was due to be paid, and

finishes at the end of the last day on which the unpaid amount or general interest charge on any unpaid amount remains unpaid.

Example:

On 31 July 2026, the Commissioner pays a PPLSC of $3,017.78 to the trustee of a complying superannuation fund for crediting to a person’s account. The trustee does not credit the amount to the account within 28 days, so becomes liable to repay the amount to the Commonwealth on 29 August 2026. The amount is due to the Commonwealth 7 days later, on 5 September 2026.

The trustee repays the amount of $3,017.78 to the Commonwealth on 30 September 2026. As the amount was not repaid by the due date, the trustee is liable to pay general interest charge on the amount for each day in the period between 5 September 2026 (the day the amount was due) and 29 September 2026 (the last day that the amount remained unpaid). The trustee must also pay general interest charge for the amount on 30 September 2026.

8.1.1 Adopted child

Introduction

This section details how the PPLAct applies to an adopted child.

An adoptive parent may make a claim for

PLP

.

The PPLAct applies to an adopted child if:

as part of the process for the adoption of a child by a person, the child becomes, or is to become, entrusted to the care of the person by an authorised party, and

the child is, or will be, under 16 years of age on the day the adopted child becomes entrusted to care.

The PPLAct applies in relation to such a child as if:

a reference to the birth of a child were a reference to the placement of the child

a reference to the expected

DOB

of the child were a reference to the expected day the child becomes entrusted to the care of the person

a reference to a child's first or second birthday were a reference to the first or second anniversary of the day the child becomes entrusted to the care of the person

a reference to a completed birth verification form for a child were a reference to information required by Centrelink about the adoption of the child, and

a reference to a child being born during the same multiple birth were a reference to the child being adopted during the same multiple adoption.

These provisions modify the PPLAct so that it applies correctly for adopted children.

5.1.8 Revocation of an employer determination for PLP

Introduction

The circumstances in which Centrelink must revoke an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) and the day the revocation comes into force are listed in the table below.

Matter of which Centrelink must be satisfied

Day revocation comes into force

1. A condition for making the employer determination was not satisfied when the determination was made.

The day of the revocation.

2. The employer has not given an acceptance notice for the person as required by a compliance notice given for a contravention of the PPLAct section 103.

The day of the revocation.

3. A decision is made that has the effect that

PLP

is not payable to the person for a flexible

PPL

day in the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

), whether or not the decision is a payability determination to that effect.

3.1 A payability determination is made for one or more flexible PPL days that are not weekdays that fall within the continuous flexible period for the child.

The day specified by the Secretary.

4. The person has ceased to be employed by the employer.

The day the person ceased to be employed by the employer.

5. The employer is insolvent.

The day the employer became insolvent.

6. The

FWO

has notified Centrelink that the employer has not complied with a compliance notice given for a contravention of PPLAct sections 70, 72 or 74 (which deal with unauthorised deductions and payment of instalments by an employer) that relates to the person.

The day of the revocation.

The day specified by the Secretary

For items 3 and 3.1 the day revocation comes into force depends on the timing of the change in circumstances that gives rise to a revocation. For events in the past or on the current day, the revocation day is the day of decision. For future events the revocation day is that future day or the day of decision, whichever in the later day of the 2.

Other circumstances in which Centrelink may decide to revoke an employer determination are:

where the employer is not a fit and proper person (

5.1.1

)

if the child in relation to whom PLP is payable is stillborn or has died, or

for any other reason Centrelink considers it appropriate to revoke an employer determination.

A revocation under the above 'other circumstances' comes into force on the day of the revocation.

Note:

An employer determination may be revoked where a child is stillborn or has died, if a person would prefer to receive their PLP from Centrelink in these difficult circumstances.

Note:

The discretion to revoke for any other reason covers unforeseen or unusual circumstances where it would not be appropriate to continue to pay PLP funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to the employer and would enable particular situations to be managed efficiently or appropriately.

If Centrelink revokes an employer determination for a person and employer, Centrelink must give the person and the employer a written notice advising of the decision.

If, when Centrelink revokes an employer determination, the employer has applied for

ART

review of a decision relating to the employer determination and the AAT has not determined the review, Centrelink is also required to notify the ART of the revocation.

8.1.2 Claims for PLP in exceptional circumstances

Introduction

This section explains how the PPLAct applies to claims for

PLP

in exceptional circumstances, as prescribed by the PPL Rules.

A claim is made in exceptional circumstances (

1.1.E.100

) when it is made in circumstances prescribed as exceptional by the PPL Rules. These circumstances generally relate to an unexpected change of primary care for the child, for example, as the result of a death or serious illness of a parent of the child. The unexpected change may allow a person to make a PPL claim or a special PPL claim, and be eligible as a PPL claimant or a special PPL claimant, depending upon the eligibility criteria as prescribed by the PPL Rules.

Note:

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances must satisfy the work test, the income test and the Australian residency test in addition to the conditions prescribed by the PPL Rules.

For a claim made in exceptional circumstances, the legislation applies as if a reference to:

the birth of a child were a reference to the claimant becoming the child's primary carer

the day the child was born were a reference to the day the claimant became the child's primary carer

the expected

DOB

of the child were a reference to the day the claimant expects to become the child's primary carer

a child's first or second birthday were a reference to the first or second anniversary of the day the claimant became the child's primary carer

a completed birth verification form for a child were a reference to information required by the Centrelink about the claimant becoming the child's primary carer, and

a child being born during the same multiple birth were a reference to the claimant becoming the primary carer of the child at the same time as becoming the primary carer of another child.

Note:

PPLAct subsection 18(3), which deals with birth registration, is excluded from the effect of section 276 so that a PLP claimant in exceptional circumstances MAY still be required to comply with the requirements of that subsection by registering the birth.

The Keyword Index and the Act Section Index have been updated to reflect the restructured Paid Parental Leave Guide released on 2 October 2012.

DAPP will be available to eligible working dads or partners who care for a child born or adopted from 1 January 2013. DAPP will provide eligible working dads or partners (including adopting parents and same-sex couples) with 2 weeks of Government-funded DAPP at the rate of the National Minimum Wage (currently around $606 per week before tax).

4.1.7 When to claim PLP

Introduction

A claim for

PLP

must be made no earlier than 97 days before the expected

DOB

or date of placement, and no later than:

If …

then …

no effective claim has been made before the child’s first birthday

the day before the child’s first birthday or the first anniversary of the child’s placement in the case of adoptions.

an effective claim has been made before the child’s first birthday

the day before the child’s second birthday or the second anniversary of the child’s placement in the case of adoptions.

Example:

If a

PPL

claim is made 360 days after the child’s birth, the claimant will have made an effective claim for PLP. Additional claimants for the child will then be able to claim flexible PPL days up until the day before the child’s second birthday.

Example:

If a PPL claim is made on or after the child’s first birthday and no PPL claim for the child has previously been made, the claimant will not have made an effective claim for PLP. Claimants for the child will be unable to effectively claim any flexible PPL days for the child.

A pre-birth claim for PLP is only effective if made no earlier than 97 days before the expected DOB of the child or expected day of placement for adoption. Ninety seven days is a period equal to approximately 3 months prior to birth/placement, and this is the earliest date from which the claimant could satisfy the work test (

1.1.W.30

).

Example:

A child is due to be born on 26 September. A pre-birth claim may be lodged from 21 June (97 days before 26 September). If a claimant chooses to lodge their claim 3 calendar months before the expected DOB on 26 June, the claim will be lodged within the allowable 97 day period.

Note:

In cases of stillbirth, reference to the child’s birthday is reference to the anniversary of day of the child’s delivery.

4.2.2.20 When can employers elect to provide PLP?

Introduction

An employer may elect to provide

PLP

for all employees, or a class of employees, or a particular employee or employees.

Where an election applies in relation to an employee at the time their claim is lodged, Centrelink can make an employer determination for the person and their employer even though the employee has not been employed by the employer for the required 12-month period. The other requirements would still need to be met, including:

a payability determination or an initial eligibility determination for the person is in force

the person has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for the child and is likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer during that period, and

the employer has an

ABN

.

Employers are able to elect to provide payments by:

pre-registering their details online with Centrelink (that is, registering details for use in connection with a claim made by any of its employees, regardless of whether any employee has claimed at that time) and indicating a group they wish to elect to provide PLP for, or

contacting Centrelink to indicate a group of employees that they wish to provide PLP for.

Which groups of employees can an employer elect to provide PLP to?

An employer can elect to provide PLP for any one of the following groups:

mandatory employees only

all employees - all full-time, part-time, permanent and casual employees, regardless of how long they have been working for the employer

all employees with at least 6 months tenure - all employees who have been working for the employer for at least 6 months, regardless of whether they are full-time, part-time, permanent or casual

all permanent employees - all employees who are employed on a permanent basis, regardless of how long they have been working for the employer, or

all permanent employees with at least 6 months tenure - all employees who are employed on a permanent basis who have been working for the employer for at least 6 months.

If an employer advises Centrelink that they wish to elect to provide PLP for a group of employees, Centrelink must obtain the consent of the individual claimant before making an employer determination. The individual may indicate their consent on the claim form.

Employer may withdraw election

The employer may withdraw an election by written notice given to Centrelink in a form approved by Centrelink. However, withdrawal of an election does not affect an employer determination that has already been made.

Centrelink may cancel an election

Centrelink may cancel an employer's election if satisfied that the employer is no longer a fit and proper person (having regard to the matters set out in

5.1.1

). However, a cancellation does not affect an employer determination that has already been made.

An employer determination can be revoked under PPLAct subsection 108(2) on the basis that the employer is not a fit and proper person.

If Centrelink cancels an election, Centrelink must advise the employer of the cancellation.

When an election is in force

An election remains in force from the time it is received by Centrelink until either the continuous flexible period for each relevant employee ends, or the employer withdraws the election or the election is cancelled.

Which employer provides PLP where the employee has more than one employer?

If a claimant has more than one employer, the employer who provides PLP is decided as follows:

If the claimant has worked for 2 or more employers in the previous 12 months, but was an employee of only one of those employers immediately prior to the child's

DOB

, that employer will provide the pay.

If the claimant has worked for 2 or more employers in the previous 12 months, and was employed by more than one employer immediately prior to the child's DOB, the claimant must nominate which employer will provide the pay.

7.1.2.20 Internal review of employer determination decision

Introduction

An employer may seek a review of a decision that they are to pay an employee instalments of

PLP

(an employer determination decision (

1.1.E.70

)). Only an employer can apply for a review of an employer determination decision or an employer funding amount decision, precluding claimants from applying.

There are no provisions for an employer to seek a review of a debt raising or debt recovery decision.

An employer may apply, in writing, to Centrelink for review of an employer determination decision that relates to the employer if the employer believes that:

the employee will not receive PLP for at least 40 consecutive

PPL

days that are weekdays

the employee has not, or will not, have been an employee for at least 12 months before the baby's expected

DOB

(for pre-birth claims) or the later of the expected DOB or actual DOB (for post birth claims)

the employee has received PLP prior to their continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

)

the employee is not an employee for which a mandatory employer determination is made AND the employer has NOT elected to provide PLP to that employee, or class of employee

the employee is not likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer for the required period, or

the employer does not have an

ABN

.

Exception:

An employer cannot apply for internal review of an employer determination decision that was made personally by a PPL agency representative (

1.1.P.160

). In this case they may apply for

ART

review.

Act reference:

5.1.1

Making employer determinations for PLP

Timing of application for internal review of employer determination decision

An application for internal review of an employer determination may only be made within 14 days after the date of the notice given by Centrelink advising the employer of the making of the employer determination. This is consistent with the timeframe for employers to respond to the Centrelink notice by either giving an acceptance notice or seeking review of the decision to make the employer determination.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 103 Employer must respond to notice of employer determination, section 207 Internal review—application for review of employer determination decision

Content of application for internal review of employer determination decision

In applying for review of the decision, the employer MUST specify which condition or conditions the employer believes are not satisfied. In cases where the employer believes payments are not likely to be payable for at least 40 consecutive weekdays to a person or the person will not have been employed by the employer for at least 12 months before the expected/actual DOB, the employer must also state whether an election to provide PLP to an employee, or to a class of employees that includes that employee, applies to the person. The application must be signed by a person authorised by the employer and be accompanied by documentary evidence supporting the application, or a statutory declaration supporting the application if the employer is unable to provide documentary evidence (for instance, where the employer does not have any records about the claimant as the claimant was never employed by the employer).

The disclosure of personal information for the purposes of making an application for review of an employer determination decision, is taken to be authorised by law for the purposes of the

Privacy Act 1988

and any provision of a law of a state or territory that provides that personal information may be used or disclosed if the use or disclosure is authorised by law. This is intended to cover situations where the employer may have to disclose personal information about one of its employees (such as that a particular person no longer works for the employer) in order to be able to apply for a review of the employer determination.

2.2.7 Activities considered as 'work' for PLP

Introduction

Qualifying work (

1.1.Q.20

) includes paid work, paid leave, a previous

PLP

and/or

DAPP

period or previous flexible PLP days.

Paid work

Paid work includes work performed as an employee, including full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal or contract work, or through self-employment, where the person is engaged in some form of gainful activity for reward or financial gain. Financial reward or gain includes the provision of goods or services for hire or reward under a contract for services, carrying on a business, including as a partnership or enterprise, or working for a trust operating as a business. The fact that a business enterprise has not yet become profitable should not prevent the activity of operating the business from counting as work.

Paid work includes work for non-cash benefit, for example, the use of a car, employer contributions of rent on a home or to school fees. Qualifying work may include ongoing or non-going activities, or activities which may not universally be regarded as work for all purposes. For example, activities such as the following count as work for PLP purposes:

jury service

time spent as a full-time member of the armed services or as a Defence Reservist

work by prisoners in formal prisoner employment programs - the features of this work are that it is genuine employment in the community with a real employer, which attracts the same employment conditions as other employees in the business

farm labour undertaken as part of exceptional circumstances relief payment

work at an Australian Disability Enterprise, and

operating a business while receiving payments under the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme.

Paid work does not include income earned for activities, which essentially do not involve personal exertion, for example, passive income, such as income gained from interest or by holding a share portfolio.

Exception:

Receipt of interest by a person may be taken to be paid work if the person's principal business consists of lending money or the interest is received in relation to a debt due to the person for goods supplied or services rendered in the course of the person's business.

The fact that a claimant has an

ABN

indicates that income is not being earned passively.

An activity which is in the nature of volunteering does not constitute paid work even if the person directly or indirectly agrees to take an honorarium, gratuity or similar payment.

Similarly, an activity required to be performed by the person as a condition for receipt of a social security payment, as defined in SSAct, is not paid work. For example, work for income support only, such as 'Work for the Dole', which is an approved program of work for income support payments, does not constitute qualifying work for PLP purposes.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Part 2-3 Division 3—The work test

PPL Rules

Part 2 Division 3—Matters relating to the work test

Paid leave

Paid leave has its ordinary meaning, that is, it is leave taken from work on a day that the person would ordinarily be at work except for being absent on that day with pay. It would include, for example, paid recreation, carer's, sick, maternity or bereavement leave. Leave paid out on termination of a person's employment does not count as qualifying work because a person cannot take leave from their employment after that employment has terminated. For example, a payout of accrued annual leave where a person has resigned or has been made redundant is not paid leave from their employment and therefore does not count as qualifying work for PLP.

The

PPL

Rules also provide that a person is taken to be on paid leave where the person receives a payment for workers' compensation or accident compensation for that day from an entity other than the employer. The payment must be in respect of the person's employment, meaning that the payment must be made to compensate a person for an injury or illness suffered at, or as a consequence of, the person's employment. Where an employee is on paid leave from their employment or is absent from work and receiving worker's compensation, the employee's normal hours of work count as qualifying work for PLP purposes.

6.2.1 Referring matters to the Fair Work Ombudsman

Introduction

The

FWO

's functions are to enquire into and investigate matters referred to the FWO by Centrelink under PPLAct section 143, commence proceedings in court in relation to a contravention of section 70 (which deals with unauthorised deductions from instalments) or Part 3-2 (which deals with payment of instalments by an employer), and any other function that is incidental to those functions.

Fair Work Inspector compliance powers

A Fair Work Inspector may exercise compliance powers within the meaning of the

Fair Work Act 2009

for the purpose of determining whether PPLAct section 70 (which deals with unauthorised deductions from instalments) and PPLAct Part 3-2 (which deals with employer payments of instalments) are being or have been complied with.

Note:

Fair Work Inspectors may exercise their compliance powers in the Fair Work Act, except for the powers under section 715 or 716 of that Act. Fair Work Act sections 715 and 716 relate to enforceable undertakings (employers cannot give enforceable undertakings relating to a breach of a civil penalty provision of the PPLAct) and giving compliance notices under the Fair Work Act (because compliance notices can be given under PPLAct section 157).

Referral to the FWO

Centrelink may refer a matter to the FWO for investigation if the Secretary or delegate has reason to believe that an employer has not complied with an obligation under PPLAct section 70 (which deals with unauthorised deductions from instalments) or Part 3-2 (which deals with payment of instalments by an employer), and Centrelink believes that the employer and employee cannot resolve the matter themselves. (See paragraph

143(1)(a) and (b))

.

Centrelink must advise the employer and employee in writing if the matter is referred to the FWO.

If the non-compliance relates to unauthorised deductions from instalments (section 70), when an employer pays instalments (section 72) or method of payment of instalments (section 74), Centrelink must also provide the FWO with information about when funding amounts were paid and a copy of the notice given to the employer in relation to each PPL funding amount. In any case of a referral, Centrelink must advise the FWO of action taken or information obtained in relation to the matter (paragraph

143(3)(a))

.

The FWO must notify Centrelink in writing of the outcome of the investigation as soon as practicable after completing the investigation.

If the FWO gives a compliance notice to an employer, the FWO must notify Centrelink of the outcome of the compliance notice.

1.1.F.20 Family tax benefit (FTB)

Definition

FTB

is a family assistance payment that consists of 2 parts: FTB Part A and FTB Part B.

FTB Part A is designed to help families with the cost of raising children. Payment of FTB Part A is based on the combined income of a family, and generally is paid in respect of each eligible dependent child.

FTB Part B provides extra help for single parent families as well as couple families with one main income earner. The payment has a primary earner income test for both couple and single parent families. For single income couple families and single parent families, the standard rate of payment is paid based on the age of the youngest child. For couple families with 2 incomes, the rate of payment is assessed on the income of a family's secondary income earner and the age of the youngest child.

4.1.1 Effective claims for PLP

Introduction

A claim for

PLP

is only an effective claim if it:

is made by a person who can make an effective

PPL

claim (

1.1.P.165

) or special PPL claim (

1.1.S.55

)

is in a form and manner required for the type of claim, and if it contains any information required and is accompanied by any documents required

4.1.6

) in relation to the child has been given and not revoked, the person has permission to make claims from the relevant person.

A PLP claim that does not meet these requirements and does not contain all the information and accompanying documents required by Centrelink is not an effective claim and is taken not to have been made. A non-effective claim cannot be determined by Centrelink.

4.2.1.20 Centrelink provision of PLP to individuals

Centrelink required to provide

PLP

Centrelink will provide PLP directly to claimants if the conditions for an employer providing PLP are not met, for example, if the claimant is self-employed, or if it is expected that the claimant will receive less than 40 weekdays' worth of PLP from their employer, or where PLP is payable in relation to a special

PPL

claim.

Where an employer is providing some of a person's PLP, Centrelink will provide PLP for any payable flexible PPL days that are not part of the person's continuous flexible period (if any).

Change of circumstances

There are other situations where Centrelink eventually provides PLP, even though originally an employer determination was made for a person and their employer. This can occur, for example, as a result of the person's change of circumstances, such as resigning from employment, or where the person revokes or becomes ineligible for a flexible PPL day during their continuous flexible period.

Example:

Janeen claims PLP and chooses to take 14 weeks of PLP as a continuous flexible period. Janeen and her employer meet the conditions for Janeen's employer to provide her PLP to her. Twelve weeks into her continuous flexible period Janeen works for 5 days, then resumes her leave. Janeen will be ineligible for flexible PPL on the days she was working, breaking her continuous flexible period. Janeen's employer will not have to provide PLP to her for her remaining flexible PPL days. Janeen can claim these days later for days she is not performing more than one hour of paid work and they will be provided to Janeen directly by Centrelink.

This may also occur if the employer experiences a change of circumstances such as ceasing to trade, or where the employer fails to comply with their obligation to accept an employer determination or to provide PLP to their employee. In these situations, Centrelink must revoke the employer determination.

8.1.6 Persons issued with a security notice

Introduction

This section explains the impact of a security notice being issued on security grounds to a person claiming or receiving

PLP

.

Issuing of a security notice

The Minister for Home Affairs (the Minister administering the

Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979

) may issue a security notice in relation to a person if the person has had:

their Australian passport cancelled, or their passport application refused, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or

their visa cancelled by the Minister for Home Affairs.

Before issuing the security notice, the Minister must consider:

the extent, if any, that payments of PLP are being, or may be used for a purpose that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country, and

the likely effect of no PLP being paid on the person's dependants.

In these cases the Minister for Home Affairs will issue a security notice to the Minister for Social Services naming the person in writing. The Minister for Social Services must provide a copy of the security notice to the Secretary of

DSS

and the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia.

Impact of a security notice on the person

While the notice is in force:

no PLP is to be paid to the person

the person is not eligible for PLP

PLP is not payable to the person.

A security notice remains in force until it is revoked.

Annual review of security notice

The Minister for Home Affairs must review a security notice within 12 months of it coming into force, and thereafter, within 12 months after the Minister for Home Affairs last considered whether to revoke the notice.

Revoking a security notice

The Minister for Home Affairs may revoke a security notice they have given to the Minister for Social Services. The revocation must be in writing and it takes effect on the day it is made. The Minister for Social Services must give a copy of the revocation notice to the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia and the Secretary of DSS.

Review & appeal of security notices

Any decision made under PPLAct Part 6-1 Division 5 regarding PLP is taken for the purposes of Chapter 5 not to be a decision of an officer under the PPLAct and is not reviewable under PPLAct Chapter 5.

However, the decision to cancel PLP may be subject to judicial review under section 39B of the

Judiciary Act 1903

or section 75(v) of

The Constitution

1.1.I.05 Incapable of caring for a child

Definition

A person is incapable of caring for a child if the person is not able to care for the child because:

there is a parenting order (within the meaning of the

Family Law Act 1975

) in force resulting in the person not providing care for the child

the person is deceased

the person is in prison or otherwise institutionalised

the person's whereabouts are unknown after all reasonable efforts have been made to locate the person

the person suffers from a medical condition, or

Centrelink is satisfied that there is another reason, beyond the control of the person, that means the person is not able to care for the child.

Example:

A person may voluntarily choose not to care for a child by deciding to travel overseas without the child or by deciding to look after other relatives and not the child.

Note:

A person is considered to be incapable of caring for a child if as a result of a medical condition, or a reason outside of their control, they have no capacity or such a limited capacity that it could be considered as no capacity, to care for a child.

1.1.M.30 Multiplier amount

Definition

A ‘multiplier amount’ is used to calculate the nominal interest rate amount (

1.1.N.20

) for a person for an income year.

The following table shows the steps involved in calculating a multiplier amount.

Step

Action

1

Calculate the number of days (elapsed days) in the period:

beginning on the first day in the income year (

1.1.I.30

) that

a

PPL

funding amount (

1.1.P.180

) for the person is paid to the person’s employer, or

an instalment (

1.1.I.80

) is payable and paid to the person by Centrelink, and

ending on the day that the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) makes a determination for the person for the income year.

Note:

The period of time may end in the income year or in a subsequent income year.

2

Divide the number of elapsed days by 365.

3

Multiply the amount worked out at Step 2 by 10% (rounded to 4 decimal places and rounding up if the fifth decimal place is 5 or more).

Example:

Alex is eligible for a

PPLSC

for the 2026–27 income year. Alex’s first PPL payment was made on 1 December 2026. On 1 October 2027, the Commissioner makes a determination of the PPLSC payable to Alex, which includes Alex’s nominal interest rate amount for the 2026–27 income year. To work out the multiplier amount needed to calculate Alex’s nominal interest rate amount, the number of elapsed days (305) is divided by 365. Multiplying the result by 10% produces a multiplier amount, rounded to 4 decimal places, of 0.0836.

6.3.4.60 Recovery from an authorised deposit-taking institution

Introduction

A debt that is recoverable by the Commonwealth arises in cases where an instalment of

PLP

or a

PPL

funding amount is paid to an

ADI

for the credit of an account kept with the ADI in the name of a person or persons, and:

the payment was intended to be paid to someone other than the person, or those persons, or

the payment was intended to be paid to the person, or one of those persons, but the person for whom the payment was intended dies before the payment was made.

Centrelink may recover these debts from the ADI. Any amount recovered by the Commonwealth from an ADI in this way reduces the amount of the debt.

Payment into an account of someone other than the intended recipient/s

If an instalment of PLP or a PPL funding amount is paid to an ADI for the credit of an account kept with the ADI, and the payments were intended for someone other than the person in whose name the account was kept, Centrelink may give a written notice to the ADI requiring it to pay back the lesser of the following amounts:

the amount of the instalment of PLP or PPL funding amount, or

the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is given to the ADI.

Death of intended recipient

If Centrelink has paid an instalment of PLP or PPL funding amount to the account of a person who has died, then Centrelink may issue the ADI with a written notice requiring the ADI to pay to the Commonwealth the lesser of:

the amount of the instalment of PLP or PPL funding amount, as stated in the notice, or

the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is given to the ADI.

If the notice relates to payment to a person who has died, Centrelink must inform the deceased estate in writing of the amount sought to be recovered from the deceased person's account, and reasons for the recovery action.

Offence for contravening notice

An ADI that refuses or fails to comply with a repayment notice is subject to a penalty of 300 penalty units.

1.4.2 Privacy & confidentiality

Introduction

This section explains the difference between confidentiality and privacy.

Confidentiality under PPLAct

Protected information (

1.1.P.270

) is defined in the PPLAct to include information about a person that is or was held in the records of Services Australia or

DSS

.

The PPLAct sets out the circumstances in which protected information can be obtained, recorded, disclosed and otherwise used. Services Australia, DSS and

ATO

staff can only deal with protected information as authorised under the PPLAct.

In limited circumstances, protected information may also be disclosed if it is in the public interest.

It is a criminal offence to access or use protected information without authorisation. A breach of the protected information framework in the PPLAct carries a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.

As the Commissioner of Taxation (

1.1.C.125

) is responsible for the administration of parts of the PPLAct related to the

PPLSC

(PPLAct Chapter 3A), people who acquire information under that Chapter are also subject to the confidentiality of taxpayer information provisions in the

Taxation Administration Act 1953

, including those relating to the disclosure of protected information within the meaning of that Act.

Explanation:

Confidentiality provisions govern the actions of Services Australia, DSS and ATO staff.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Part 4-1 Division 3—Confidentiality

Taxation Administration Act 1953

Division 355—Confidentiality of taxpayer information

Policy reference:

6.1.2

Confidentiality

Privacy law

The

Privacy Act 1988

governs the manner in which 'personal information' is handled by Commonwealth agencies and businesses. It also provides safeguards for the collection and use of

TFN

s.

'Personal information' is defined in the Privacy Act to mean information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

Services Australia, DSS and the ATO are required to comply with the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act. The APPs are grouped as follows:

consideration of personal information privacy (APPs 1 and 2)

collection of personal information (APPs 3, 4 and 5)

dealing with personal information (APPs 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9)

integrity of personal information (APPs 10 and 11), and

access to, and correction of, personal information (APPs 12 and 13).

Services Australia, DSS and ATO staff must comply with the APPs when dealing with personal information. Unauthorised collection, access, use or disclosure of personal information is a breach of the Privacy Act.

Explanation:

Privacy provisions govern the practices of Government agencies and businesses.

Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015

The Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 (TFN Rule), made under section 17 of the Privacy Act, regulates the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of individuals' TFN information.

A breach of the TFN Rule is an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner. Where a breach is very serious, the Information Commissioner may seek to impose a civil penalty.

As well as constituting a breach of the TFN Rule, unauthorised use or disclosure of TFNs may constitute an offence under the Taxation Administration Act, with a maximum penalty of an $18,000 fine (100 penalty units) or 2 years' imprisonment, or both.

Services Australia, DSS and the ATO are authorised recipients of TFN information for the purposes set out in the PPLAct.

More detailed information about privacy and the TFN Rule is available at the

OAIC's website

, and TFN queries or enquiries can be directed to the DSS Feedback and Complaints team using the following contact details:

2.2.6.10 Supporting evidence for special circumstances claims

Introduction

To meet the work test (

1.1.W.30

) through a claim of special circumstances, a person must show to Centrelink’s (

1.1.C.20

) satisfaction that:

one of the special circumstances in the PPL Rules (

1.1.P.220

) applied to them on a specific day

the special circumstances prevented them from doing paid work on that day, and

they would have met the work test on that day if not for the special circumstances.

There is no single type of evidence required for a successful

PPL

claim (

1.1.P.165

) under special circumstances. The purpose of evidence is to satisfy the decision maker that:

there were special circumstances, and

the claimant would have met the work test if those circumstances had not applied.

This topic provides examples of situations and key points for claimants and Centrelink to consider when making or assessing special circumstances claims.

section 24B Special circumstances—satisfying the work test on a day

Policy reference:

Work test for PLP

Evidence of special circumstances

Types of appropriate evidence a claimant can provide depends on their situation. Evidence will carry greater weight if that evidence is relevant to a situation of special circumstances and from a reputable source. Examples include:

a medical certificate

a letter from a treating doctor

a letter from an employer

a letter from a social worker or another allied health professional.

The evidence should:

explain the claimant’s circumstances

link those circumstances to one of the criteria in the PPL Rules

link those circumstances to the claimant not being able to do paid work.

Example:

Kristy has worked full-time in hospitality for 5 years. In October 2022, she is diagnosed with heart failure and takes 6 months off work to recover and rehabilitate.

She becomes pregnant in February 2023 and returns to work part-time in April 2023. Her child is born on 29 October 2023.

Kristy’s work test period is between 3 October 2022 and 29 October 2023. She did not work or have a permissible break for at least 295 consecutive days in her work test period. This means she does not meet the usual work test.

However, Kristy provides evidence from her doctor explaining her medical condition and how it prevented her from performing paid work during her work test period. She also provides a letter from her employer stating that, if not for her illness, she would have kept working during those 6 months. Finally, Kristy had returned to work after her rehabilitation.

These pieces of evidence show Kristy would meet the work test were it not for her severe medical condition.

Example:

Riley has worked casually for 3 years. Over the last year, her work becomes irregular because of a mental health condition.

In January 2023, she provides her employer with a medical certificate stating she is unable to work regularly due to her mental health condition. During this time, Riley works only when she is able to.

Riley gives birth in January 2024. Riley has not worked or had a permissible break for at least 295 consecutive days in her work test period. This means she does not meet the usual work test.

Riley provides evidence from her doctor verifying that her mental health condition has prevented her from working regular hours. She also provides evidence from her workplace stating that she worked regular hours before her mental health condition had become more severe, and if her condition were not as severe, she would have otherwise worked those hours.

Together this evidence satisfies the decision maker that Riley has been affected by a severe medical condition that prevented her from performing paid work and would have met the work test were it not for her mental health condition.

Evidence of meeting the work test on a day if the special circumstances had not existed

In addition to a claimant showing they had special circumstances, they must also provide evidence that they would have met the work test if the special circumstances had not existed. That is, without the special circumstances, the claimant would have:

completed 330 hours of qualifying work during the work test period (

1.1.W.40

)

worked for 295 consecutive days during the work test period or had a permissible break (

1.1.P.130

).

An example of an acceptable form of evidence of this is a letter from the claimant’s employer (or former employer) confirming:

the claimant was working before the special circumstances began

a number and pattern of hours worked by the claimant that would have likely met the work test at the time, and

whether the work pattern indicated for the claimant, was expected to continue during the work test period if not for the special circumstances.

Note:

Evidence showing a clear pattern of work that would have met the work test had it continued can be compelling and readily available, but is not a requirement for a decision maker to be satisfied that a claimant would have met the work test if the special circumstances had not existed. An example of alternative evidence might be communication from an employer that the claimant was to begin full time work at a future date in a situation where the work ultimately did not eventuate due to the special circumstance.

Example:

Eden has worked full-time as a barista for 5 years before she is injured on a ski holiday in February 2022. Her injuries are serious and require long-term rehabilitation. She takes 6 months of sick leave, followed by another 6 months of unpaid leave. She returns to work in February 2023, working 2 days a week to fit in with her ongoing rehabilitation. Her employer agrees she will resume her full-time role once she recovers.

On 1 July 2023, Eden gives birth to her child. Her work test period is from 4 June 2022 to 1 July 2023. Eden has not worked enough consecutive days of qualifying work during this time to meet the usual work test. However, Eden provides medical evidence of her injuries and their impact. She also provides a letter from her employer confirming that she worked full-time until her injury and returned to work on a shared understanding that she would gradually resume full-time hours as her rehabilitation progressed.

This evidence shows that a serious medical condition prevented Eden from working and that she would have met the work test if not for her injury. Eden therefore meets the work test under the special circumstances provisions.

Example:

Lucy returns to Australia in January 2021 after working overseas as a tattoo artist. Seeking a career change, she begins a 4-year full time bachelor’s degree at a local university. Lucy begins working at a tattoo studio a few hours each week on a casual basis to supplement her student payments. After studying for a year, her father becomes ill and requires full time care. Lucy cares for her father while studying part-time and continuing to work casually.

Lucy gives birth on 14 December 2024. Her work test period is from 18 November 2023 to 14 December 2024. Despite working, Lucy has not worked enough hours of qualifying work to meet the usual work test.

She provides medical evidence from her father’s doctor confirming his condition and the need for ongoing care, and that Lucy has been his primary carer. The decision maker is satisfied that Lucy’s circumstances meet the criteria for a special circumstance because of her father’s medical condition and her caring role.

Lucy also submits a letter from her employer confirming her casual work arrangement, including the number of hours Lucy worked per week. The decision maker is not satisfied that Lucy would have met the work test had she not been caring for her father. This is because her work prior to being her father’s carer was limited and there is no logically probative evidence which shows that this pattern of work would have changed but for the special circumstances.

As a result, Lucy is not eligible for PPL for this child. She claims, is found to be eligible for, and receives

FTB

(

1.1.F.20

), including

NBS

and

NBU

.

Example:

Johanna applies for PPL with an expected birth date of 20 June 2025. She states that she cannot meet the work test because she has been providing full-time care for her mother, who has dementia, for the past 4 years.

As part of her claim, Johanna provides a letter from her mother’s doctor confirming the diagnosis, the need for full-time care, and Johanna’s role as primary carer. She also includes a letter from her previous employer stating she has worked full-time until resigning to care for her mother, and that she would have remained employed during the work test period if not for her caring responsibilities.

The decision maker accepts the medical evidence as supporting special circumstances. However, due to the time since Johanna last worked and the limited detail in the employer’s letter, more information is requested from the employer to confirm Johanna would still have been employed during that 4-year period.

The employer responds noting that the position Johanna had previously held had recently been made redundant and that it is more likely she would not have remained employed. Johanna is unable to provide additional evidence. Her PPL claim is rejected as she does not satisfy the work test.

After her child is born, Johanna continues to receive

CP

and

CA

. She also begins receiving FTB, including the NBS and NBU.

Decision makers must consider other reasons why a person may have failed to meet the work test

When deciding if a claimant would have met the work test without the special circumstances, the decision maker must make a retrospective assessment of the claimant’s situation and consider if there were other reasons the claimant might not have met the work test.

Example:

Camille has worked at a steelworks for 15 years. The steelworks is the only one in town and is key to its economy. Camille has a strong personal attachment to both the town and steelworks.

In February 2018, Camille sustains serious injuries in a car accident. Following this, she takes 6 months paid sick leave followed by 6 months unpaid leave.

Her employment ends in January 2019, and her doctor advises she is unlikely to return to work.

Camille gives birth in April 2024. Her work test period is from 19 March 2023 to 14 April 2024. She has not performed any qualifying work within the work test period so does not meet the usual work test. Camille provides medical evidence from her doctor showing her injuries have prevented her from working.

To support her claim for a work test exemption, Camille provides a previously obtained letter from the steelworks stating she would have remained employed if not for her injuries. However, just prior to her work test period, the steelworks she was working in closed. This event was publicised nationally. The decision maker is aware of the closure and its impacts and assesses that, had Camille continued to be employed at the steelworks if not for her injuries as her evidence states, she would not have been employed during the work test period as the closure was sudden and most residents have remained unemployed while a bailout package is negotiated. While her injuries have clearly been a barrier to work, the evidence does not establish that she would have remained employed given the profound changes to the local economy and her enduring connection to the area.

The decision maker determines that Camille does not meet the criteria for a work test exemption and is not eligible for

PLP

under the special circumstances' provisions.

Where claimants cannot produce acceptable evidence

Claimants who have been out of the workforce for some time may find it difficult to show they would have been working if the special circumstances had not existed. However, it is important that possibilities for showing acceptable evidence are explored before a decision is made.

To make decisions fair and defensible when a claimant has not provided enough evidence to show they would have met the work test without special circumstances, Centrelink must:

tell the claimant they need to provide further evidence showing they would have met the work test if the special circumstances had not applied, and

if the claimant says they cannot get more evidence, clearly explain why the evidence is needed, how the decision maker can be satisfied, and what types of evidence may be acceptable.

Example:

Jeremiah was injured in an accident in January 2018 that prevents him returning to work. He receives

DSP

and has not been in paid employment since the accident.

Jeremiah adopts a child in May 2024. He does not meet the usual work test but knows that exemptions are available for severe medical conditions. He provides evidence from his doctor saying that his injuries prevented him from working during the work test period. However, Jeremiah is not able to provide any other evidence that he would have met the work test if not for his condition. His doctor’s evidence only shows his condition prevented him working, not that he would have worked otherwise.

The decision maker decides Jeremiah is not eligible for PLP. He is advised that he can receive FTB, including the NBS and NBU, along with his DSP. These payments begin in May 2024.

Example:

Jane claims PPL with an expected birth date of 5 March 2025. Her work test period is from 7 February 2024 to 5 March 2025.

In August 2024, Jane contracts COVID-19 while working as a doctor and develops chronic fatigue. This prevents her from continuing work and she eventually loses her job. She is unable to meet the usual work test.

Jane successfully lodges a compensation claim against her employer, but the employer disputes liability, resulting in the 2 developing a strained relationship.

When completing her PPL claim, Jane indicates she may be eligible for a work test exemption due to special circumstances and is required to attach evidence. She provides a medical certificate confirming her condition and its impact on her ability to work during the work test period. Jane is unable to get a supporting letter from her employer due to the strained relationship.

She contacts Centrelink and identifies her payslips as alternative evidence. The payslips show a consistent work pattern from February to August 2024, followed by reduced hours and extensive sick leave. Jane also provides a copy of her employment contract, which outlines her full-time role and expected ongoing employment prior to her illness.

This combined evidence satisfies the decision maker that Jane has been affected by special circumstances and would have met the work test if not for her illness. Based on the medical certificate, payslips, and employment contract, Jane is granted a work test exemption, and her PPL claim is approved.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.2.3

NBS and NBU eligibility for individuals

Claimants must consider whether they are permitted to disclose certain information & documents

Medical and other evidence obtained in relation to court proceedings (in particular personal injuries and workers compensation claims) may be, or may contain, material relevant to a claim of special circumstances. An example is an independent medical expert report commissioned by another party for court which directly addresses the nature and extent of a person’s injury, and the extent the injury has impacted on the person’s ability to participate in paid employment.

However, this material may not be able to be used to support PPL claims. Certain material obtained as a result of compulsory processes of a court or tribunal cannot be used for a purpose other than that for which it was sought without permission from the court (see

Hearne v Street

(2008) 235 CLR 125)

. In these circumstances claimants MUST ensure that, BEFORE using any such documents or evidence in support of a claim for an exemption from the work test due to special circumstances, leave has been obtained from the court or tribunal. Alternatively, a claimant may be able to show the material was tendered in open court. If there is any uncertainty, a claimant should obtain independent legal advice.

Introduction

The situation may arise where Centrelink or the employer is required to pay an instalment of

PLP

on a payday for a later instalment period but there is no later instalment period. An example might be where Centrelink is required to pay arrears to a person but the person does not have a subsequent instalment period.

6.3.1.10 Overpayments or mistaken payments of PLP instalments

Summary

A debt to the Commonwealth may arise if a claimant has been paid an instalment of

PLP

from an employer or Centrelink in excess of the total amount payable to the claimant.

If the claimant was paid the excess amount of PLP from their employer, the claimant owes a debt to the Commonwealth. The amount of this debt is the amount that the claimant received that exceeds what was payable to them. Any excess amount that the employer has received as a PLP funding amount and has NOT paid the claimant is a debt owed by the employer to the Commonwealth.

If Centrelink pays an excess amount of PLP to the claimant, the amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the claimant. If the claimant has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for the child, the debt arises after the end of that period. Otherwise the debt arises when the excess payment is made to the claimant by the employer or Centrelink.

Debts may be raised if instalments of PLP stop being payable retrospectively, if the payability determination is later set aside or varied.

) applies for internal review of the decision

an employer applies for internal review either of an employer determination decision (

1.1.E.70

) or an employer funding amount decision (

1.1.E.80

).

Centrelink may authorise officers to be

ARO

s (

1.1.A.140

6.2.3.30 Consequences of payment & non-payment of penalty

Payment of penalty

An infringement notice can be given as an alternative to commencing proceedings for a civil penalty order. The penalty in an infringement notice which a person is liable to pay, is one-fifth of the maximum penalty that a court could order in a civil penalty order.

An employer can pay the penalty specified in an infringement notice in order to avoid going to court. If the employer does not comply with an infringement notice, Centrelink or the

FWO

could bring proceedings for a civil penalty order. Once an employer has paid a penalty in accordance with an infringement notice Centrelink or the FWO cannot apply for a civil penalty for the same contravention and the employer is discharged from any liability in respect of the contravention in the infringement notice.

Extension of time to pay amount

A person to whom an infringement notice is given may apply for an extension to pay. If the application is made before the 28 day extension period is complete, the relevant Chief Executive may in writing, extend the period. If the Chief Executive does not approve the request for extension, the period to pay the infringement will end 28 days after the notice was issued or 7 days after the person was given notice of the decision not to extend the time to pay.

Non-payment of penalty

Where an employer does not comply with an infringement notice (or elects not to pay a pecuniary penalty), Centrelink or the FWO may decide to take further action.

If Centrelink or the FWO decides to pursue the matter, they must commence proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit Court of Australia for a civil penalty order in respect of the contravention, no later than 6 years after the contravention. If the court is satisfied that the person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the court may on the application of Centrelink or the FWO order the person to pay to the Commonwealth such amount as the court determines appropriate, up to the maximum penalty specified in PPLAct section 147.

1.1.P.20 Paid work

Definition

A person performs paid work, including work as a self-employed person or work as the result of engagement, for example, as a defence force member or law enforcement officer, on a day if, on that day, the person performs work (whether as an employee, a contractor or otherwise and whether or not in Australia) for another entity for remuneration or other financial benefit.

Other financial benefit includes non-financial remuneration. As a result, for example, work performed on a family farm for remuneration in the form of housing and food etc. would be included.

Paid work would include jury service.

A person who is regarded as self-employed, performs paid work on a day if the person performs work for the purpose of a business that is carried on (whether in or outside of Australia) by the person (whether alone or with others) or an entity that is controlled by the person (whether alone or with others). The business must be carried on for profit, that is, not entirely for a charitable purpose.

A person 'controls' an entity if the person has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the entity's financial and operating policies.

1.2 PPL scheme - description

Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of the

PPL

scheme. The brief descriptions draw together key elements of the scheme including its objectives, eligibility and the impact on certain other entitlements.

The PPL scheme provides for

PLP

, a Government-funded payment to support eligible parents and other carers to take time off work after a birth or adoption.

The length of the PLP entitlement varies depending on the date the child was born or adopted. The PPL scheme provides for PLP to be paid for:

up to 20 weeks or 100 payable days for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2023

up to 22 weeks or 110 payable days for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2024

up to 24 weeks or 120 payable days for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025

up to 26 weeks or 130 payable days for children born or adopted on or after 1 July 2026.

For maximum entitlements for specific types of claimants see

2.9

.

Claims for PLP can be lodged up to 97 days (3 months) before the expected

DOB

or adoption.

Payments under the PPL scheme can be made between the child's DOB or adoption, and the day before the child's second birthday, or second anniversary of entry to care.

The payment rate for PLP is calculated by reference to the

NMW

order and funded by the Australian Government.

The PPL scheme does not provide a leave entitlement and does not change existing employer-provided leave entitlements. PLP complements parents' existing entitlements to employer-provided paid and unpaid leave, such as access to 12 months unpaid parental leave under the National Employment Standards (NES) for long-term employees. PLP can be taken before, after or at the same time as existing employer-provided paid or unpaid maternity or parental leave, or other employer-funded leave entitlements (such as annual leave or long service leave).

To be eligible for PLP, a claimant must generally meet the scheme's:

work test (

2.2

)

income test (

2.3

), and

residency test (

2.4

).

In addition, a claimant for PLP on a flexible PPL day must generally be:

caring for a newborn or recently adopted child, and

not performing more than one hour of paid work on the day.

The payment is available to full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers.

PLP is usually provided by a person's employer where the person:

has been an employee of the employer for 12 months or more prior to the DOB or adoption of the child

has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) and is likely to be an employee of the employer for that period

is an Australian-based employee

there are no flexible PPL days prior to the person’s continuous flexible period for which the person is payable or initially eligible, and

expects to receive at least 40 consecutive weekdays of PLP from their employer.

In other cases, and for flexible PPL days that are not part of the person's continuous flexible period, Centrelink makes the payment of PLP directly to the parent.

A person who receives PLP for a child will not be eligible for

NBS

for that child. In the case of a multiple birth, a person can receive PLP for one child and NBS for a second or subsequent child.

A person (or their partner if they are a member of a couple) who receives PLP for a stillborn child will not be eligible for

SBP

for that child. In the case of a multiple birth, a person can receive PLP for one child and SBP for a second or subsequent child.

A person who receives PLP will not be entitled to

FTB

Part B on payable flexible PPL days.

The PPL scheme also provides for the

PPLSC

, a Government-funded contribution to the superannuation funds of people who receive PLP.

The amount of a PPLSC is calculated and paid by the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

). The calculation is made on the basis of the sum of all PPL funding amounts and instalments paid for the person during the income year, multiplied by the

SG

charge percentage (

1.1.S.96

), and includes an interest component. The Commissioner will generally calculate and pay a PPLSC in the subsequent income year.

8.2.5 Protection of principals & nominees

Introduction

When a nominee is appointed, the nominee is required to act in the best interests of the principal (the recipient, whether a

PPL

claimant or special PPL claimant).

Centrelink must be satisfied that a proposed nominee understands the responsibilities they are taking on and appears capable of carrying them out.

If Centrelink has given the nominee a notice under PPLAct section 288 (

8.2.4

) and the nominee notifies Centrelink of an event or change of circumstances that affects, or is likely to affect, their ability to continue to be a nominee or fulfil nominee responsibilities, Centrelink may suspend or cancel their appointment.

If any allegations of misuse of the payment by a nominee are received, the nominee arrangement must be reviewed immediately.

The principal is not guilty of an offence under the PPLAct where the offence is due to the correspondence nominee's act or omission. Conversely, the nominee is not subject to criminal liability under the Act because of an act or omission of the principal or anything the nominee has done in good faith in their capacity as nominee.

6.1.1.10 Obtaining information - person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth

Obtaining information from a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth

Centrelink may require a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth under or because of the PPLAct to give information or produce a document to a specified agency if Centrelink considers the information or document is relevant to their financial situation. If the person's address changes Centrelink may also require the person to provide information of their new address, within 14 days after the change.

Example:

Documents may include:

bank statements

property title deeds

employment details

financial management and existing loan details, and

details of share or stock trading activities.

Obtaining information about a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth

Centrelink may require a person to give information or produce a document to a specified agency if Centrelink believes that the information or document would help the specified agency locate another person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth (the debtor), or that is relevant to the debtor's financial situation.

Explanation:

The Commonwealth has an obligation to prevent people who are not eligible for payment from receiving

PLP

. To help with this process Centrelink may require information from other sources such as the

ATO

and other Australian and overseas government departments, banks and financial institutions in order to determine an individual's entitlement to a payment. Centrelink is limited in the type of information they may request to verify and validate claims (

4.1.3

).

Written notice to request information

A notice in writing to request information from a person or about a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth must be by a written notice, which may be given:

personally

by post, or

in any other manner approved by Centrelink.

The written notice must specify the following:

a description of the information or document to which the requirement relates

how the person is to provide the information or produce the document

the period within which the person is to provide the information or produce the document

the agency and contact officer (if any) to whom the information is to be given, or the document is to be produced

that the notice is given under PPLAct section 120, and

if the notice requires the person to appear before an officer to answer questions, that the person may be accompanied by a lawyer and the time and place at which the person must appear (which must be at least 14 days after the day the notice is given, unless the Secretary is satisfied that it is reasonable in the circumstances to specify an earlier time).

Note:

The notice may describe the information or documents by class (see

Acts Interpretation Act 1901

subsection 33(3AB)).

Explanation:

Providing a written notice to the claimant/recipient or employer enables Centrelink and the claimant/recipient or employer to retain and keep records. Allowing a minimum of 14 days for providing information enables Centrelink to make allowances for claimants/recipients or employers located in remote areas.

Relationship with other laws

No state or territory law can operate to prevent a person from giving information or producing a document or giving evidence where required to do so for the purposes of the PPL law, unless in doing so they would contravene a law of the Commonwealth (other than the law of a territory).

Refusing or failing to comply with a request

Refusing or failing to comply with a requirement to provide information or produce a document is a criminal offence with a penalty of imprisonment for 6 months.

This does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to provide information or produce a document.

Exception:

It is not a criminal offence under this section if the person to whom PLP is payable refuses or fails to provide their bank account details.

Self-incrimination

A person is not excused from giving information, or producing a document on the grounds that the information or the production of a document might tend to incriminate or expose the person to a penalty.

However, in the case of an individual, any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of giving the information or producing the document are not admissible in evidence against the individual in any criminal proceedings, other than:

proceedings for an offence against subsection 122(1) of the PPLAct

proceedings for an offence against section 137.1 or section 137.2 of the

Criminal Code Act 1995

, or

proceedings for an offence against division 145 of the Criminal Code.

Use of information in investigations etc.

Information given, or documents produced by a person in response to a request from Centrelink can be used in an inquiry or investigation into a matter or criminal proceedings.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 118 Power to obtain information from a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth, section 119 Obtaining information about a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth, section 120 Written notice of requirement, section 121 Relationship with other laws, section 122 Offence—failure to comply with requirement, section 122A Self-incrimination, section 122B Use of information in investigations etc.

6.2 Compliance

Introduction

This chapter is about employer compliance with obligations relating to the payment of instalments of

PLP

to a person and penalties that may apply to non-compliance.

Employers have a direct role in the delivery of PLP to their long-term employees. An employer's obligations under the PPLAct only arise where an employer determination has been made for the employer and the person. Employer compliance with obligations under the PPLAct is essential for the proper administration of the

PPL

scheme.

Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

) and the

FWO

each have a role in ensuring that employers comply with their obligations under the PPLAct. Centrelink may refer certain matters to the FWO for investigation and compliance action where it is believed that an employer may have contravened his or her obligations in relation to the payment of instalments of PLP to a person.

Note:

For a person who is a defence force member, a reference to the FWO or the Fair Work Inspector is taken to be a reference to the Defence Force Ombudsman.

Civil penalties

Certain employer obligations under the PPLAct are civil penalty provisions (

1.1.C.80

). Those provisions are listed in the table at section 146 of the PPLAct (

6.2.4

). Under the PPLAct, Centrelink and the FWO can enforce employer obligations in 3 ways:

Centrelink or the FWO can issue a compliance notice for contravention of a specified civil penalty provision, requiring the person to rectify the contravention

Centrelink or the FWO can issue an infringement notice under Part 5 of the

Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014

for contravention of a specified civil penalty provision including failure to comply with an infringement notice, requiring the person to pay pecuniary penalty, or

Centrelink or the FWO can apply to the court for a civil penalty order under Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act for contravention of a civil penalty provision, potentially requiring the employer to pay a higher pecuniary penalty.

Centrelink or the FWO does not have to issue a compliance notice before issuing an infringement notice or applying for a civil penalty order. Centrelink or the FWO may choose to issue an infringement notice or apply for a civil penalty in the first instance. If the employer complies with an infringement notice by paying the required pecuniary penalty, Centrelink or the FWO will not be able to apply for a civil penalty order in relation to the same contravention.

Compliance notices

Centrelink or the FWO may give a compliance notice (

1.1.C.140

) in certain circumstances if they reasonably believe that the employer has contravened one or more of the civil penalty provisions specified. Compliance notices must require the employer to take the action specified in the notice to rectify the contravention and produce reasonable evidence of compliance within 14 days of the day on which the notice is given. More information about compliance notices can be found in

6.2.2

.

In some instances it will be inappropriate to issue a compliance notice because the employer who has contravened the civil penalty provision cannot rectify the contravention.

Example:

An employer has contravened a civil penalty provision by failing to make payments to an employee and Centrelink has taken over payments to rectify the situation. In this case, the employer will be unable to rectify their contravention. Centrelink may then issue an infringement notice or seek a civil penalty order instead of a compliance notice.

Infringement notices

Centrelink or the FWO may issue an infringement notice (

1.1.I.60

) under Part 5 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act if Centrelink or the FWO reasonably believes that the person has contravened one or more of the civil penalty provisions of the PPLAct. An infringement notice must specify a pecuniary penalty and contain a statement that the matter will not be dealt with by a court if the penalty is paid within a specified timeframe. More information about infringement notices can be found in

6.2.3

.

A person who is given an infringement notice can choose to pay a penalty. If the penalty is not paid, a civil penalty order may be sought in relation to the person.

Civil penalty orders

Centrelink or the FWO can apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia to grant a civil penalty order under Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act for contravention of any of the civil penalty provisions listed under PPLAct section 146. If the court is satisfied that a person has contravened one or more civil penalty provisions the court may order them to pay a pecuniary penalty, subject to the limits and matters that must be taken into account by the court under subsection 82(5) and subsection 82(6) of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act.

Centrelink or the FWO can apply for a civil penalty order regardless of whether a compliance notice or infringement notice has been issued. Centrelink or the FWO will usually apply for a civil penalty order only after a person has failed to comply with an infringement notice. Failure to comply with an infringement notice, however, is NOT grounds for a civil penalty order. A civil penalty order can only be made under Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act for contravention of a civil penalty provision under PPLAct section 146. More information about civil penalty orders can be found in

6.2.4

.

Note:

Civil penalties and infringement notices do not directly affect individuals eligible for PLP as they apply only to employers with obligations imposed by PPL law.

The Secretary can only delegate powers under Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act (re civil penalty orders) and under Part 5 of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act (re infringement notices) to the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Chief Executive Medicare, or to an

SES

employee or an acting SES employee.

2.2.8 Permissible break for PLP

Permissible break

A break between consecutive days in the work test period will be a permissible break (

1.1.P.130

) where it was between 2 days on which a person performed qualifying work (

1.1.Q.20

) (that is, qualifying work days), and the break was no more than 84 consecutive days (12 weeks) in length.

For children born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process on or after 1 July 2020, a person can count the days they have received flexible

PPL

(for a previous child) as qualifying work for a new claim.

Note:

For children born or entrusted to care prior to 1 January 2020, a break between consecutive qualifying work days is permissible if it was less than 56 days (8 weeks).

There are 2 situations when a break can be considered a permissible break. The first is where the break occurred between 2 work days in the work test period (that is, in the 392 days before the expected or actual

DOB

, or the day the person becomes the child's primary carer) and the break is not more than 84 days.

Example 1:

Jane is expecting to give birth to a child on 13 January 2020. Jane's 392 day work test period commences on 17 December 2018. Jane did not work on this day, but she worked on 20 December 2018 and then worked on 31 December 2018 and thereafter for a continuous period up to 13 October 2019.

To satisfy the work test, Jane needs to establish a qualifying period of 295 consecutive days between the start of the work test period on 17 December 2018 and when she ceased work on 13 October 2019. As Jane had performed qualifying work on 20 December 2018 and on 31 December 2018 and as the period between these dates was less than 84 days in length, Jane can be considered to have been on a permissible break between the start of the work test period on 17 December 2018, and the day she performed qualifying work on 20 December 2018 and 31 December 2018.

As a permissible break can count towards the work test, Jane is considered to have worked 301 days between 17 December 2018 and 13 October 2019. Therefore, providing the requirement for 330 hours of qualifying work is met, Jane would meet the work test, as the period of qualifying work performed during the work test period is at least 295 consecutive days.

In the example above, Jane's hours worked on 1 December 2018 do not count towards requirement for 330 hours or the 295 consecutive days as it was outside of her work test period. This day is only used to establish that a period within the work test period was a permissible break and provides some flexibility in circumstances where the claimant does not work on the start day of the 13-month work test period.

The second situation is where there was a break between 2 consecutive qualifying work days and the break started before, and ended after, the start of the work test period. In this situation, providing the period between the 2 work days was no longer than 84 days, the period from the beginning of the work test period until the first qualifying work day in the work test period can be considered to be a permissible break, and this period can be considered towards the qualifying period of 295 consecutive days.

Example 2:

Salima is expecting to give birth to her first child on 12 December 2020. Salima's 392 day work test period starts on 16 November 2019. Salima finishes her job 20 October 2019 and does not start work in another job until 18 January 2020, a break of more than 84 days. Salima then works every week from 18 January 2020 until 14 November 2020, a period of 300 consecutive days. The break between qualifying work days that occurred early in the work test period is not a permissible break as it was a break of more than 84 days.

The break does not affect Salima's eligibility for

PLP

because there was still a qualifying period of at least 295 consecutive days in the work test period where Salima performed qualifying work or had a permissible break, that is, weekends off work.

A break of more than 84 days between 2 consecutive qualifying work days is considered not to be a permissible break.

Example 3:

Maria is expecting to give birth to her second child on 6 July 2020. Maria's 392 day work test period commences on 10 June 2019. To prepare for the baby's arrival in July Maria took unpaid leave from 12 December 2019 until 13 March 2020. From 13 March 2020 until 22 June 2020 Maria returned to work, 3 days a week. The break between qualifying work days between December 2018 and March 2019 was more than 84 days, therefore it was not a permissible break.

In the example above, as there was no period of qualifying work performed during the work test period of at least 295 consecutive days (including permissible breaks), the claimant will not meet the work test requirements and will not be eligible for PLP.

6.1.1 General power to obtain information

Introduction

Centrelink can only require a person to give information or produce a document for

PLP

purposes if it reasonably believes that the person will be able to give the information or produce the document.

For PLP purposes, Centrelink may require a person to provide information or produce a document, if Centrelink considers that the information or document may be relevant to one or more of the following:

determining whether a claimant has made an effective claim for PLP, and if so, whether the person is or was eligible or is or was initially eligible for PLP

determining whether PLP is or was payable to a person

determining who should pay instalments of PLP to a person

ensuring instalment payments are able to be paid into the bank account of the person to whom they are payable

determining whether to make an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) or whether one should have been made

determining whether

PPL

funding amounts are or were payable to an employer

ensuring that an employer complies or has complied with its obligations under the PPLAct

any inquiry or investigation into a matter listed above.

Example:

Information required may include:

evidence relating to a person's period of employment

evidence relating to Australian residence

the claimant's

ATI

for the relevant year.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 116A Reasonable belief needed to require information or documents, section 117 General power to obtain information

Written notice to request information

A requirement to provide information or produce a document under PPLAct Part 4-1 Division 2 Subdivision A must be made by a written notice, which may be given:

personally

by post, or

in any other manner approved by Centrelink.

The written notice must specify the following:

a description of the information, document or records to which the requirement relates

how the person is to provide the information or produce the document

the period within which the person is to give the information or produce the document

the agency and the contact officer (if any) to whom the information is to be given, or the document is to be provided

that the notice is given under PPLAct section 120, and

if the notice requires the person to appear before an officer to answer questions, that the person may be accompanied by a lawyer and the time and place at which the person must appear (which must be at least 14 days after the day the notice is issued unless the Secretary is satisfied that it is reasonable in the circumstances to specify an earlier time).

Explanation:

Providing a written notice to the claimant/recipient enables Centrelink and the claimant/recipient to retain and keep records. Allowing a minimum of 14 days for providing information enables Centrelink to make allowances for claimants who reside in remote areas.

Note:

The notice may describe the information or documents by class (see subsection 33(3AB) of the

Acts Interpretation Act 1901

)

Relationship with other laws

No state or territory law can operate to prevent a person from giving information, producing a document or giving evidence that the person is required to give or produce for the purposes of the PPL law, unless that in doing so would contravene a law of the Commonwealth (other than a law of a territory).

Refusing or failing to comply with a request

Refusing or failing to comply with a requirement to provide information or produce a document is a criminal offence. The penalty for such a failure or refusal is 6 months imprisonment.

This does not apply if the person has a reasonable excuse for failing or refusing to provide information or produce a document.

Exception:

It is not a criminal offence under this section if the person to whom PLP is payable refuses or fails to provide their bank account details.

Self-incrimination

A person is not excused from giving information, or producing a document on the grounds that the information or the production of a document might tend to incriminate the person or expose the person to a penalty.

However, in the case of an individual, any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of giving the information or producing the document are not admissible in evidence against the individual in any criminal proceedings, other than:

proceedings for an offence against subsection 122(1) of the PPLAct

proceedings for an offence against section 137.1 or section 137.2 of the

Criminal Code Act 1995

, or

proceedings for an offence against division 145 of the Criminal Code.

Use of information in investigations etc.

Information given, or documents produced by a person in response to a request from Centrelink can be used in an inquiry or investigation into a matter, or criminal proceedings.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 116A Reasonable belief needed to require information or documents, section 117 General power to obtain information, section 120 Written notice of requirement, section 121 Relationship with other laws, section 122 Offence-failure to comply with requirement, section 122A Self-incrimination, section 122B Use of information in investigations etc.

5.2.2 Payability determinations for PLP

Introduction

For

PLP

to be payable to a person on a flexible

PPL

day, the following conditions must be met:

the person must make an effective claim for that flexible PPL day

the person must be eligible on that day, and

Centrelink must make a determination that PLP is payable to the person for the day.

Different rules apply to the making of a payability determination for a flexible PPL day depending on the type of claim, whether it is a PPL claim or a special PPL claim.

There are restrictions that apply to prevent Centrelink from making a payability determination that PLP is payable in some circumstances. There are also general provisions that apply to payability determinations.

4.3.2.10 Deductions from PLP authorised by person

Introduction

The employer or Centrelink may deduct an amount from an instalment (

1.1.I.80

) if the deduction is authorised in writing by the person and is principally for the person's benefit.

A deduction by an employer in accordance with a salary sacrifice or other arrangement is permitted if authorised by the person.

Centrelink may deduct an amount from an instalment to repay a debt owed by a claimant if the deduction is authorised in writing by the person.

Centrelink may also deduct an amount from an instalment that is payable to a

PPL

claimant or special PPL claimant to repay a debt owed by another PPL claimant or special PPL claimant relating to an instalment for the same child, provided the deduction is authorised by the first PPL claimant or special PPL claimant.

An authorisation must be in writing and specify the amount of the deduction. An authorisation may also be withdrawn in writing by the person. The amount to be deducted can also be varied by written authorisation by the person.

1.1.P.180 PPL funding amount

Definition

For the purposes of

PLP

,

PPL

funding amounts are paid by Centrelink to a person's employer where Centrelink is satisfied that an instalment is or is likely to be payable to the person, and the employer is or is likely to be required to pay the instalment to the person.

Centrelink is required to pay PPL funding amounts to an employer within a reasonable period before the payroll cut-off for the instalment. In practice, employers are likely to receive PPL funding amounts a day or 2 before their payroll cut-off, to ensure that instalments are able to be paid on the next available payday.

A PPL funding amount must not be less than the minimum amount (

1.1.M.20

).

A PPL funding amount for an employer cannot exceed the sum of the minimum amount and 30 times the daily

NMW

amount (equal to 6 weeks of PLP) that applies on the day the PPL funding amount is paid to the employer.

While PPL funding amounts are generally payable to an employer in fortnightly amounts, the employer can ask for their PPL funding amounts to be made in three 6-weekly payments if that would be simpler for them to administer.

The employer has a separate obligation to pay an equivalent amount to their eligible employee as instalments of PLP on the relevant payday.

6.3.8 Departure authorisation certificates

Introduction

Where a

DPO

is in force, a debtor can apply for the issue of a

DAC

. A DAC allows a debtor to depart Australia, for a defined period, despite a DPO being in force.

Issuing a DAC

Centrelink must issue a DAC in situations where:

a debtor is likely to depart and return to Australia within a specified period, revocation of the DPO is likely within a time period that Centrelink considers appropriate, and security for the debtor's return to Australia is not necessary, or

the debtor has provided appropriate security for their return to Australia by a specified date, or

the debtor is unable to provide appropriate security for their return to Australia, however a DAC is to be issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia's interests.

There is no discretion to issue a DAC in other situations.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200G Application for departure authorisation certificate, section 200H When Secretary must issue departure authorisation certificate, section 200U Production of authority to depart

DAC issued where security provided

Centrelink must issue a DAC when the debtor has given appropriate security for their return to Australia. The debtor can provide the security by deposit or other means. If they do not return to Australia by the agreed date, the security will be forfeited to the Commonwealth. It cannot be applied against the outstanding debts.

Centrelink will only accept a security that:

is in a form that is readily convertible to cash, such as a bank cheque

is offered by the debtor rather than third parties on the debtor's behalf, or

is generally not significantly less in value than the amount of the debts owing.

Note:

Security arising from a loan is not accepted.

Where a debtor is able to give appropriate security, it is preferable to use these funds to reduce these debts than to use these funds as security, as this will usually justify revoking the DPO. Offering security may be an appropriate alternative to reducing the debts when the debts are in dispute and the debtor is taking steps to resolve this dispute.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200J Security for person's return to Australia

DAC issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia's interests

Centrelink must also issue a DAC where satisfied that:

the certificate should be issued on humanitarian grounds

refusing to issue the certificate would be detrimental to Australia's interests, and

the debtor is unable (not unwilling) to provide security satisfactory to Centrelink for their return to Australia.

Humanitarian grounds include compassionate grounds.

The onus is on the debtor to provide evidence satisfactory to Centrelink that shows their situation meets the above requirements.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200H When Secretary must issue departure authorisation certificate

Centrelink may substitute a later return date on the DAC

Centrelink may substitute a later return date on a DAC, either in response to an application by the debtor or by their own initiative. The debtor may apply in person or in writing.

Centrelink may refuse to substitute a later date for the person's return if they believe an extension would be inappropriate.

Centrelink has the discretion to ask for an additional amount of security, even where a security was not previously required.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200J Security for person's return to Australia

Departure dates for a DAC

A DAC authorises a debtor's departure from Australia within an 8 day period beginning on the date specified on the certificate. The date specified on the certificate can only be within one and 7 days after the date the certificate is issued.

A DAC can only be issued between one and 14 days before the debtor's intended date of departure.

Usually, Centrelink will specify the date on the certificate to be the debtor's intended date of departure. However, Centrelink can specify a date other than the debtor's intended date of departure - within the period outlined above - where it is appropriate to do so.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200K What departure authorisation certificate must authorise

Notification requirements to make, vary or refuse a DAC

Where Centrelink makes or decides to substitute a later day in a DAC, Centrelink must notify:

the debtor to whom the DAC applies, and

any other person who was notified of the DPO.

If Centrelink rejects an application to issue a DAC or substitute a later day, they must notify the debtor as soon as practicable.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200L Notification requirements for departure authorisation certificates, section 200M Notification requirements for substituted days

Review by

ART

A person may apply to seek a review of a Centrelink decision by the ART in regard to:

revocation or variation of a DPO

issuing of a DAC, or

the provision of security, and the substitution of later days on a DAC.

The ART will undertake an independent merits review of the decision. The ART can exercise the discretions granted to Centrelink when reviewing decisions.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200R Review of decisions

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

6.3.7

Departure prohibition orders

Enforcement

Australian Border Force officers and members of the Australian Federal Police are authorised to prevent the overseas departure of a person subject to a DPO.

If an officer believes that a person is about to depart from Australia when a DPO is in force and without a departure authorisation certificate, they can require the person to answer questions or produce documents.

A person is required to answer these questions, even if the answers may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty. However, their answers are not admissible in evidence against them except in relation to a prosecution for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 200S Powers of officers of Customs and members of the Australian Federal Police, section 200T Privilege against self-incrimination, section 200U Production of authority to depart

Offences

It is an offence for a person to depart from Australia for a foreign country:

knowing, or reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and

the person's departure is not authorised by a DAC, and the person knows the departure is not authorised by such a certificate, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by such a certificate.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

A person commits an offence if they fail to answer a question or produce the document and they are capable of doing so.

Penalty: 30 penalty units.

It is also an offence of strict liability if a person who has a valid DAC fails to produce the certificate at the request of an authorised officer.

Penalty: 5 penalty units.

A person who provides false or misleading answers to questions commits an offence and can be prosecuted.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

An attempt to commit any of these offences is punishable as though the actual offence had been committed.

7.2.5 After an ART review concludes

Introduction

After the

ART

review concludes, there are several things the ART must do and several they can do, if appropriate. These include:

notifying parties to the review of its decision and reasons

publishing decisions

correcting errors in the text of its decisions or reasons

making decisions on costs.

Notification of decisions & reasons for concluded ART reviews

If the ART makes a decision to affirm, vary or set aside an ART reviewable decision on review then it must give each party to the ART review the following in writing:

The ART’s decision

A statement of reasons for the decision

Notice of the right to apply to refer the decision to the guidance and appeals panel, where applicable

Notice of the right to a second review, where applicable (

7.3

)

Notice of the right to appeal to the Federal Court

Exception:

Notification is not required where the decision made is in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the parties of an ART review.

Unless the President of the ART has made a practice direction stating otherwise, each item described above must be given within 28 days after the day the ART’s decision is made.

The ART may give a decision and the reasons for the decision orally before giving them in writing.

Note:

A failure by the ART to provide the things mentioned above by the time required does not affect the validity of its decision.

Exception:

The ART can order the restriction of publication or disclosure of information. The general requirement to provide notification of a decision and reasons is subject to such an order. Likewise, where a public interest certificate has been issued restricting the disclosure of specified information, the notification requirements above do not require the disclosure of the specified information.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 111 Notice of decision and statement of reasons—review of reviewable decision

Notification of decision & statement of reasons – other proceedings

If the ART makes a decision finalising an ART review, other than those above or:

a decision in relation to an Attorney-General certifying that the disclosure of information would be against the public interest or intervening to prevent a question being answered

a decision to dismiss the ART review application with the parties’ consent

a decision in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the parties

a decision of the President of the ART to refer a decision to the guidance and appeals panel

then the ART must give each party to the ART review notice of its decision either orally or in writing. If the ART has not given a party a statement of reasons for its decision, then the party may request, in writing and within 28 days of the decision being made, the ART provide a statement of reasons. The ART must give the party a statement of reasons within 28 days of receiving this request.

Exception:

The ART can order the restriction of publication or disclosure of information. The general requirement to provide notification of a decision and reasons is subject to such an order. Likewise, where a public interest certificate has been issued restricting the disclosure of specified information, the notification requirements above do not require the disclosure of the specified information.

Explanation:

Other decisions that will finalise an ART review can include the decision to dismiss the application as:

the applicant has withdrawn it

it is for review of a decision which is not reviewable by the ART

a relevant fee payable by the applicant has not been paid

the applicant has not appeared at a relevant case event

the applicant has failed to comply with an order, or

it is frivolous or vexatious.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 112 Notice of decision and statement of reasons—other proceedings

Publication of decisions

The ART can publish its decisions and the reasons for them as long as it does so in accordance with any requirements specified in the practice directions.

The ART must publish a decision and the reasons for it where the President considers that the decision involves a significant conclusion of law or has significant implications for Commonwealth policy or administration or was a decision to affirm, vary or set aside an ART reviewable decision (not made in accordance with a decision agreed by parties) made by the guidance and appeals panel.

Exception:

In publishing its decision, the ART cannot publish information prohibited or restricted from disclosure by legislation.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 70 Tribunal may restrict publication or disclosure of information, section 113 Tribunal may publish decisions

Correcting errors

If after the ART has made its decision and the ART considers there is an obvious error in the text of the decision or statement of reasons for the decision, then the ART may alter the text and the altered text is considered to be the decision or statement of reasons respectively.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 114 Tribunal may correct error in decision or statement of reasons

Costs

If the ART orders a party to an ART review to pay costs incurred by another party and the parties cannot agree on the amount of the costs, then the ART can decide the amount. This amount is recoverable as a debt from the paying party by the owed party.

6.2.3 Infringement notices

Introduction

Infringement notices (

1.1.I.60

) are intended to encourage employer compliance with the requirements of the PPLAct. Centrelink or the

FWO

can give an infringement notice under Part 5 of the

5.1.9 Notice of employer decisions for PLP

Introduction

Centrelink must notify employers of decisions as follows.

Notice of outcome of a payability determination

Where an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) is made for a person and their employer and, after the determination is made, Centrelink makes a payability determination that

PLP

is either payable or not payable to the person, Centrelink must notify the employer in writing about whether PLP is payable to the person and, if PLP is payable, must include the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

). A decision that PLP is not payable to a person will result in the revocation of an employer determination if an employer determination had previously been made for the person and the employer (

5.1.8

).

Centrelink is not required to give a notice of the outcome of a payability determination if the employer determination has previously been revoked.

Notice of varying, setting aside or revoking a payability determination

Where Centrelink has made an employer determination for a person and their employer and Centrelink then varies, sets aside or revokes a person's payability determination, Centrelink must notify the employer in writing about the effect of the decision. If the effect is to change the person's continuous flexible period then a Centrelink notice must also advise of the different continuous flexible

PPL

period.

Centrelink is not required to give a notice of the outcome of a variation, setting aside or revocation of a payability determination, if the employer determination has previously been revoked.

Notice of other decisions

The PPL Rules may provide for Centrelink to give notices in other circumstances, containing such information as is prescribed by the PPL Rules. There are currently no provisions in the PPL Rules relating to such notices.

4.3.1.20 Amount of instalment of PLP

Introduction

The amount of an instalment payable to a person is the sum of the total of the daily

NMW

amounts for each day (including weekends) during the relevant instalment period that are payable flexible

PPL

days (

1.1.F.70

) for the person.

The daily NMW amount (

1.1.D.10

) for a day is defined as 7.6 times the amount of the NMW (expressed as a monetary amount per hour) set by a NMW order (

1.1.N.10

) that is in operation on that day, irrespective of whether it takes effect on that day.

The daily NMW amount for a flexible PPL day is adjusted from the day of operation of the order (that is, 1 July) and not the day of effect.

The NMW order comes into operation under the

Fair Work Act 2009

section 287. The Fair Work Act subsection 287(5) provides that the NMW order comes into operation on 1 July, but does not take effect in relation to a particular employee (

1.1.E.40

) until the employee's next payday.

For the purposes of the PPLAct, the NMW is taken to be the wage set by the NMW order for employees in relation to whom no exceptional circumstances exist. This means that the NMW amount for a flexible PPL day is the same for all people and is not affected by the Fair Work Act section 294 , which provides for special NMWs for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability.

If a determination is made to vary a NMW order and the determination comes into operation on a day that is earlier than the day the determination is made, the determination is taken to come into operation on the day the determination is made. Any such variation would therefore not affect the daily NMW amount retrospectively, regardless of the date of operation specified in the order.

Introduction

A person who is not a parent of the child or a partner of a parent of the child may be a

PPL

claimant (

1.1.P.170

) for

PLP

days, in exceptional circumstances (

1.1.E.100

).

Eligibility criteria

A person who is not a parent of the child or a partner of a parent of the child can be eligible for PLP, if they meet the core PPL requirements (

2.1

) relating to:

the work test (

1.1.W.30

)

the income test (

ATI

(

1.1.A.40

)), and

1.1.A.110

).

They must also:

be caring for a child unless

they are temporarily unable to care for the child (

1.1.T.50

), or

they have lost care for the child (

1.1.L.30

), and

not be performing more than one hour of paid work on the day not unless

they have lost care of the child without their consent

they are a defence force member or law enforcement officer and they have been compulsorily recalled to duty

they have performed work because they had to comply with the requirements of a summons or other compulsory process to give evidence or information, or produce documents or other things, or

they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker (

1.1.E.95

) and they returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency.

A PPL claimant cannot be eligible for a flexible PPL day that exceeds their maximum PLP entitlement (

2.9

).

A person does not need permission to claim in order to make a PPL claim in exceptional circumstances.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances may give permission to claim PLP to their partner as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances.

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

Exceptional circumstances criteria

Any person can make an effective claim for PLP as a PPL claimant under exceptional circumstances if:

the person became the primary carer of the child before the child's first birthday or before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child for adoption, and

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, and either

the birth mother or the adoptive parents or parents (as the case requires), are incapable of caring for the child (

1.1.I.05

) and are expected to remain so for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks, or

Centrelink is satisfied on reasonable grounds that

the person became the primary carer of the child in special circumstances

it would be unreasonable (

1.1.U.10

) for the birth mother or adoptive parent or parents to care for the child, and

it is in the interests of the child (

1.1.I.90

) for the person to care for the child.

In addition, the following must apply:

the partner (if any) of the birth mother or the partner of the adoptive parent or parents (as the case requires) is incapable of caring for the child

the child was not entrusted to the care of the person or the person's partner under a decision of a state or territory child protection agency or a court of a state or territory under legislation dealing with child protection, and

the Secretary is satisfied on reasonable grounds that

the person became the primary carer in special circumstances

it would be unreasonable for the partner of the birth mother or partner of the adoptive parent to care for the child, and

it is in the interests of the child for the person to care for the child.

5.1.1 Making employer determinations for PLP

Introduction

Centrelink is required to make an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) (that the person's employer is required to pay instalments) if Centrelink is satisfied of all of the following matters:

A payability determination that

PLP

is payable to the person or an initial eligibility determination for the person is in force in relation to the child.

Instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable by the employer to the person for at least 40 consecutive days that are weekdays (that is, the person is expected to receive at least 8 weeks of PLP from the employer).

The person has, or will have been, employed by the employer (or by the Commonwealth) for at least 12 months immediately before

the expected

DOB

(or placement) of the person's child where the person claims before the birth, or

the later of the expected DOB (or placement) and the day the child was born where the person claims after the birth.

The person has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for the child and is likely to be an Australian-based employee (

1.1.A.90

) of the employer during that period.

There are no other flexible

PPL

days prior to the person’s continuous flexible period that the person is either payable for or has been found initially eligible for in relation to the child.

The employer has an

ABN

.

Exception:

The requirement for an employer ABN does not apply to employers of law enforcement officers and defence force members.

A person has a continuous flexible period for the child if they are payable or initially eligible for at least 40 consecutive flexible PPL days that are weekdays before the day before the child’s first birthday or placement for adoption.

If the person has more than one employer who satisfies the required criteria, then the person must nominate in their claim the employer they would like to pay their instalments.

Exception:

Where the person's employer has elected to pay the person their instalments, and the person has consented in the claim to the employer paying their instalments, the requirement that the person has or will have been employed by the employer (or by the Commonwealth) for at least 12 months prior to the expected or actual DOB (or placement) does not have to be met.

Centrelink cannot make an employer determination unless Centrelink is satisfied of the matters referred to above and the employer determination is made on or before the day the payability determination is made.

Exception:

If the payability determination is made following a review, the employer determination can be made after the day of the payability determination.

Centrelink may decide not to make an employer determination where:

the person's continuous flexible period for the child has ended

the person is a special PPL claimant

the child in respect of whom PLP is payable is stillborn or has died

another PPL claimant or special PPL claimant owes a debt in relation to an instalment paid in relation to the same child, or

the employer is not a fit and proper person.

Matters that Centrelink may take into account in determining whether an employer is a fit and proper person include:

whether the employer is insolvent

whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a civil penalty provision of the PPLAct

whether a matter relating to a contravention of the PPLAct by the employer has been referred to the

FWO

whether the employer has, or is alleged to have, contravened a provision of an industrial law

whether the employer has been convicted of certain criminal offences involving fraud or dishonesty, misapplication of money, management of affairs of a body (whether or not incorporated), and

any other matter Centrelink considers relevant.

In deciding whether to make an employer determination, Centrelink may assume that the state of affairs known at that time will remain unchanged.

Note:

Centrelink must not make an employer determination for PLP for a person receiving an income support payment. Centrelink must administer instalments of PLP for these claimants.

1.1.W.40 Work test period

Definition

For the purposes of

PLP

, a person's work test period is usually the 392 days (which is broadly equivalent to 13 months) immediately before a specified date that is either the expected or actual

DOB

of the child (or the date that the child enters care).

If the work test is being assessed prior to the birth of the child for the purposes of an initial eligibility determination (

1.1.I.70

), the person's work test period is the 392 days immediately prior to the expected DOB of the child.

If the work test is being assessed after the DOB of the child, the person's work test period is the 392 days immediately before the DOB if the child is born on or before the expected DOB.

If the work test is being assessed after the DOB, the person's work test period is the 392 days immediately before the DOB if the child is born after the expected DOB. However, if a person does not satisfy the work test because the child was born late, the 392 days immediately before the expected DOB may be used for the work test period. This is to provide the most flexible work test options where the person has left work and the baby is born late.

Example:

A birth mother who leaves work 3 months before the expected DOB, having thought they had met the work test, may no longer be eligible if the baby is born 2 weeks after the expected DOB. If the birth mother lodges a claim after the birth, the work test period is based on the actual date of birth. If the birth mother does not satisfy the test using this work test period, a work test period based on the expected DOB may be applied.

For a birth mother who does not meet the work test in the applicable period described above because they ceased work due to hazards connected to their work that posed a risk to their pregnancy, the work test period will be the 392 days prior to the day the claimant is no longer performing work in the hazardous job (

2.2.3

).

COVID-19 affected claimants

PLP

For the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination in relation to a claimant who is a COVID-19 affected claimant (

1.1.C.165

), the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the expected DOB or adoption.

For the purposes of making an eligibility determination in relation to a claimant who is a COVID-19 affected claimant, the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the child's actual DOB or placement for adoption. If the person is unable to meet the work test based on the actual date of DOB or placement of the adoption, and the child was born or placed after the expected DOB or placement, the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the expected DOB or placement.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 6 The Dictionary, section 31AB When a person is not eligible for PLP on a flexible PPL day for a child, section 33 The work test period—claimants other than COVID-19 affected claimants, section 33A The work test period-COVID-19 affected claimants

6.3.1.30 Wrong person receives a PLP instalment or PPL funding amount

Summary

A debt will arise if the wrong person:

receives all or part of an instalment of

PLP

from Centrelink or an employer, or

receives all or part of a

PPL

funding amount from Centrelink, AND

is not authorised by the right recipient (the person to whom the PPL payment is payable) or authorised under law to receive the instalment.

If the original payment is made by Centrelink, the amount received by the wrong person is a debt due to the Commonwealth by that person.

If the original PLP payment is made by the employer, the amount received by the wrong person is a debt due to the employer by that person.

Centrelink is obliged to pay the right recipient the amount of the PLP payment that is payable to them. An employer is obliged to pay the right recipient the amount of PLP that is payable to them.

Where the amount is paid by Centrelink into the wrong person's bank account, Centrelink may, under the 'recovery from an

ADI

' provision, recover the amount.

7.2.1 ART review of claimant decisions

Introduction

An

ART

review is available for certain reviewable claimant decisions. A person affected by an ART reviewable claimant decision (

1.1.A.02

) may apply for an ART review of the decision.

Note:

In most instances, an ART reviewable claimant decision will be reviewed at first instance per the guide below. In certain circumstances, ART reviews of claimant decisions may also be conducted as a second review. Details of second reviews (

7.3

) or guidance and appeals panel review (

1.1.G.30

), both of which have unique features that may not correspond with the policy below. For more details on their specific features, see page

7.3

in this guide.

Note:

An employer cannot apply to the ART for a review of an ART reviewable claimant decision, including a second review. Nor can an employer apply to be a party of the review proceedings.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 215 Application of this Division, section 216 ART review of claimant decision—application for review

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

7.3

Second review of claimant decisions,

7.4

Guidance & appeals panel reviews

ART reviewable claimant decision

An ART reviewable claimant decision is a claimant decision as affirmed, or varied, or substituted as a result of the internal review process, or a claimant decision made personally by a

PPL

agency representative.

An ART reviewable claimant decision does not include decisions:

relating to the making of claims, the form and manner of claims, the form and manner of notices

which deal with deductions relating to child support

relating to gathering information from any person

relating to the Secretary's power to settle proceedings before the ART.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 215 Application of this Division, section 216 ART review of claimant decision—application for review

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

7.1.2.10

Internal review of a claimant decision

Variation of original decision after application is made for ART review

Despite the ARTAct generally prohibiting the alteration of a decision except by the ART once an application for review has been made, under the PPLAct, Centrelink, on its own initiative, may vary or substitute a reviewable claimant decision, as long as the President of the ART has not referred the application to the guidance and appeals panel or an application for second review (

7.3

) has not been made. Once changed, the decision as varied or substituted, rather than the original decision, becomes the decision under ART review.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 226 Variation of original decision after application is made for ART review, section 203 Internal review—own-initiative review by Secretary

ARTAct

section 31 Decision cannot be altered outside Tribunal process

Operation & implementation of decision under ART review

Making an application for an ART review does not ’pause’ the operation of the reviewable decision nor prevent Centrelink from taking action to implement the decision. In some cases, parties to an ART review can apply to have the ART make an order staying (that is, suspending) or other otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the decision under review, but this is not available for ART reviews of reviewable claimant decisions unless the review is conducted as a second review or guidance and appeal panel review.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 225 Operation and implementation of decision under ART review

ARTAct

section 32(2) Exception—Tribunal may stay operation or implementation, section 131V Operation and implementation of decision on second review

Timing of application for review

Generally, a person has 28 days from the date the ART reviewable claimant decision (the

ARO

's decision or PPL agency representative decision) is made to apply to the ART for a review of the decision. The ART may, upon application in writing by a person, extend the timeframe for applying for a review, even if it has already expired, if it is satisfied that is it reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to do so. The ART may give notice or require an applicant to give notice of the extension application to other persons affected by an extension.

Once a person has been notified of the extension application, they have 14 days within which to notify the ART they oppose it. The ART must not accept the extension unless all the parties notified have had a reasonable opportunity to make their submissions to the ART about the extension.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 18 When to apply—general rule, section 19 Exception—Tribunal may extend period

Form of application for review

For more information on how to make an application to the ART for review of a decision, go to the

ART website

.

Parties to a review

Generally, the parties to an ART claimant decision review are:

the person who applied for review

the decision-maker (the Secretary of

DSS

)

any other person if they apply to the ART to become a party and the ART is satisfied their interests are affected by the decision and it is appropriate for them to become a party.

Note:

A person whose interests are affected by the decision in their capacity as an employer cannot apply to be a party to the review.

Note:

If a party, who is neither the applicant nor a non-participating party, fails to appear or comply with an order of the ART (which was reasonable) then the ART may order they cease to be a party to the ART review. They can be reinstated at a later time if the ART wishes.

Generally, although listed as a party to an ART review, the Secretary has elected not to participate in an ART review. The decision-maker can still give written submissions to the ART but will not participate directly in hearings.

Note:

The Tribunal can still require a decision-maker to participate in the ART review despite them electing not to participate.

Exception:

The decision maker is a participating party:

Where the decision maker has provided a written notice that they wish to participate and the ART has decided to accept the request.

The ART has ordered the decision-maker to participate.

The ART review is a second review or guidance and appeals panel review.

The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may elect to become a party in matters of significant public importance, where the outcome of the matter might have significant implications for the development of the law or the community more broadly (going beyond the interests and concerns of the parties directly involved in the ART review).

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 216(2) However, a person cannot make an application …, section 224A Person who made the decision, section 224B Decision-maker taken to have elected not to participate in ART review proceeding

ARTAct

section 22 Parties to proceeding for review, section 59 Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may become a party, section 62 Tribunal may allow non-participating part to participate, section 63 Non-participating party may give submissions or be required to participate, section 83 Tribunal may remove party from proceeding if party fails to appear or does not comply

Withdrawing & dismissing applications

The applicant may withdraw their ART review application at any time by giving written notice to the ART. The ART will then be taken to have dismissed the application.

The ART may also dismiss an application in other situations, including with the consent of all participating parties.

If an application is dismissed it can be reinstated within 28 days (or longer if special circumstances justify it) either by the ART’s own initiative or by a party applying for reinstatement and the ART considering it appropriate in the circumstances (unless the application was dismissed by consent).

Act reference:

ARTAct

Part 4 Division 8 Subdivision A Withdrawing and dismissing applications

ART decisions

The ART review process can conclude with the ART making one of several decisions.

The ART must make a decision on an ART review of a reviewable decision either:

affirming the reviewable decision

varying the reviewable decision, or

setting aside the reviewable decision and

making a decision in substitution for the reviewable decision, or

remitting the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration in accordance with any orders or recommendations of the ART.

If at any time all the parties to the ART review of a reviewable claimant decision agree, in writing, to a decision on the review as a whole or a specific part or matter in the review, then the ART may, if it is satisfied that the agreed decision is within its powers to make, make that decision. Likewise, the ART may vary or revoke a decision on the agreement of the parties.

In certain circumstances, the ART does not require a hearing to have occurred before making a decision in an ART review. For more information, please see section 106 of the ARTAct.

Act reference:

ARTAct

Part 4 Division 8 Decision

Operation & effect of review decisions

As a general rule the ART’s decision on an ART review comes into operation when it is given to the parties to the review. However, the ART may specify a later time in their decision, or the decision may still be subject to a stay order (

7.3

and

7.4

). Additionally, while an ART decision that varies or substitutes the original reviewable decision is operative from the date it is given to the parties, it will have effect from any such time that is necessary to give full effect to the new decision, which may be from a time before or after that of the original reviewable decision (depending on the nature of the ART varied or substituted decision).

Exception:

The ART or the Federal Court may make an order for the decision to come into operation at a different time, overriding the stay order.

When the ART decides to vary or substitute the original reviewable decision, the new decision is taken to be a decision of the decision-maker (in most cases Centrelink).

Exception:

the varied or substituted decision is taken to be a decision of the decision-maker for all purposes other than:

where a decision-maker did not make a decision to do something within a required timeframe and so was taken to have made a decision not to do the thing

applying for a review of a decision

referrals to the Federal Court

decision-makers being required to give notice of their decisions.

1.2.2.30 Taxation & superannuation

Taxation & superannuation guarantee for businesses

PPL

funding amounts are assessable income for employers and the employer is entitled to a tax deduction when amounts of

PLP

are paid to employees.

Costs of providing PLP (for example, the deductible component of software expenses) are deductible expenses necessarily incurred by the employer in carrying on a business.

PLP has no goods and services tax or capital gains tax implications.

Employers are not required to pay payroll tax in respect of instalments of PLP paid to an employee.

Employers are not required to make superannuation guarantee contributions in respect of PLP.

PLP provided by employers

Where the employer provides PLP, the employer is required to withhold

PAYG

amounts at the appropriate rate for the employee, consistent with their withholding obligations for other pay and allowances paid to the employee.

Employees are able to salary sacrifice PLP where their employer offers such an arrangement and the PLP is provided by the employer.

PLP provided by Centrelink

Where the PLP is provided by Centrelink, Centrelink will withhold tax either at the default rate of 15% or at another rate nominated by the recipient.

Employees are not able to salary sacrifice PLP provided by Centrelink.

Note:

The amount of tax a recipient must pay depends on their taxable income (see the definition of taxable income in the SSAct subsection 23(1)) for the financial year. A recipient's expected or possible taxation arrangements is solely a matter between the person and the

ATO

. Any enquiries regarding either the ATO's requirements or tax assessments should be discussed directly with the ATO.

PPLSC provided by the ATO

A

PPLSC

paid by the Commissioner of Taxation (

1.1.C.125

) is not considered taxable income for the purposes of social security, family assistance, veterans’ entitlements and child support legislation, which is consistent with the treatment of compulsory superannuation contributions.

The PPLSC is treated as a concessional contribution when it is received by a person’s superannuation fund, in line with the treatment of employer superannuation guarantee contributions. This means it will generally be subject to 15% concessional contributions tax in the fund and will count towards a person’s concessional contributions cap in the year it is received by the fund.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 68 Deductions for PAYG withholding

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

section 307‑133 PPL superannuation contribution payment

10 Births & adoptions before 1 July 2023

Introduction

This part provides an overview of the

PPL

scheme for children born or adopted before 1 July 2023. These rules are reflected in the PPLAct as in force at 25 March 2023, and the PPL Rules as in force at 30 June 2023.

Note:

To view a full version of the PPL Guide for children born or adopted prior to 1 July 2023, go to the National Library of Australia

Trove

page.

Overview

The PPL scheme provides for:

PLP

DAPP

To be paid to a person for:

a PPL period for a maximum of 12 weeks

up to 30 flexible PPL days.

To be paid to a person for their DAPP period for a maximum of 2 weeks.

Payments can start from the child's

DOB

or adoption, or a later date. The PPL period and DAPP period must be fully paid within 52 weeks of the DOB or adoption, commencing no earlier than the birth or placement of the child.

To receive the full amount of the PPL period, the claim needs to be made, and the start date needs to be, within 40 weeks of the DOB or adoption. Flexible PPL days must be taken before the child's second birthday, or second anniversary of entry to care.

To receive the full amount of DAPP, the claim needs to be made within 52 weeks of the DOB or adoption and the start date needs to be within 50 weeks of the DOB or adoption.

Eligibility

To be eligible for PLP or DAPP, a claimant must meet the scheme's:

work test

income test, and

residency test.

In addition to meeting the scheme's work test, income test and residency test, claimants must also meet the below.

For PLP

For DAPP

During the PPL period:

the primary carer of a newborn or recently adopted child, and

on leave or not working from the child's DOB or entry to care until the end of the person's PPL period.

On a flexible PPL day:

the primary carer of a newborn or recently adopted child, and

on leave or not working on the day.

During the Dapp period:

caring for a newborn or recently adopted child, and

on unpaid leave or not working during the DAPP period.

Note:

If a claimant returns to work before the end of their PPL period or during their DAPP period, their payment will be cancelled from the date they return to work, as they will cease to be eligible for the remainder of their PPL period or DAPP period.

A claimant will continue to be eligible for any remaining flexible PPL days up until the child's second birthday, even if they have periods of work in between the flexible PPL days claimed.

Migrants who are granted a permanent visa or a temporary partner visa are required to serve a

NARWP

of 104 weeks before they can receive PLP or DAPP. A NARWP also applies to claimants for certain social security payments,

FTB

Part A and farm household allowance.

There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and DAPP.

Claims

Centrelink cannot make a determination that PLP or DAPP is payable to a person for a child for a period unless the person has made an effective claim for the child.

Claims for PLP or DAPP can be lodged up to 97 days (3 months) before the expected DOB or adoption.

For both PLP and DAPP an effective claim must:

be in a form and manner required for the type of claim

be made by a person who can make an effective claim for the relevant claim type

contains any information or documents required

contains the claimant's

TFN

statement.

The following applies to primary claimants of PLP and DAPP claimants:

the claim is made in the period starting 97 days before the expected DOB, or expected day of placement, of the child and ending on the day before the child's first birthday, or the day before the first anniversary of the day of placement of the child

states the nominated start date of the relevant payment

if the claim is made before the child is born or adopted, it states the child's expected DOB, or expected day of placement, or

if the claim is after the child is born or adopted, it states the child's actual DOB, or actual day of placement.

The following applies to secondary claimants of PLP:

there is an effective primary claim, and the secondary claim is made in the period starting 97 days before the expected DOB or placement of the child and ending on the day before the child's second birthday or the second anniversary of the child's day of placement

if the claim is made before the day the secondary claimant expects to become the child's primary carer, the claim must specify the date the claimant expects to become the child's primary carer and contain information about the child's expected DOB or placement, or the claimants expected day of primary care.

If the claim includes flexible PPL days, the claimant must declare they will not be working and will meet residency and primary care requirements on any flexible PPL days claimed.

Only a natural person can make a claim.

A primary claimant for PLP may be:

the child's birth mother

an adoptive parent of the child, or

a person who satisfies the circumstances prescribed by the PPL Rules as being exceptional circumstances in which a primary claim for PLP can be made.

A secondary claimant for PLP may be:

the partner of a PLP primary claimant

a person who is a parent of the child and is not the PLP primary claimant, or

the partner of a person who is a parent of the child and not a PLP primary claimant, or a person who satisfies the circumstances prescribed by the PPL Rules as being exceptional circumstances in which a secondary claim can be made.

In addition to primary and secondary claimants, a person who satisfies the circumstances prescribed by the PPL Rules as being exceptional circumstances in which a tertiary claim can be made, may make a tertiary claim for PLP. A tertiary claimant is a person who has taken on the care of a child in exceptional circumstances before the end of the child's maximum PPL period, and both a primary claimant and a secondary claimant have been determined payable in respect of the child.

A tertiary claimant may have previously been the primary claimant for PLP for the child, or the tertiary claimant may be a different person.

The following people may be able to claim DAPP:

the biological father of the child

the partner of the birth mother (including same-sex partners)

an adoptive parent, or

a person who satisfies the circumstances prescribed in the PPL Rules.

Initial eligibility & payability determinations

Claims for PLP and DAPP are subject to initial eligibility and payability determinations.

Initial eligibility determinations

An initial eligibility determination may be made where an effective claim has been made, and Centrelink cannot yet make a determination that it is payable to the claimant, for example, because the child has not yet been born and hence the birth has not been verified as required before a payability determination can be made.

Centrelink can make an initial eligibility determination if satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria.

Payability determinations

Centrelink must make a payability determination about whether the relevant payment is payable to a person if an effective claim has been made.

For PLP different rules apply depending on the type of claim, claimant and whether the claim was made alone or with another claim. There are restrictions that apply to prevent Centrelink from making a payability determination that PLP is payable in some circumstances. There are also general provisions that apply to payability determinations.

For DAPP there are restrictions that apply to prevent Centrelink from making a payability determination that DAPP is payable in some circumstances and general rules that apply to payability determinations.

Payments

Payments made under the PPL scheme for PLP and DAPP are taxable payments. The rate of payment is based on the hourly rate of the

NMW

.

During the PPL period, PLP is payable for each week day in the instalment period at the daily NMW amount for PLP. Flexible PPL is payable for each day claimed (including weekends) at the daily NMW amount for PLP.

DAPP is payable at the rate of the daily NMW amount for DAPP for each weekday during the person's DAPP period.

The daily NMW amount for PLP and DAPP is 7.6 times the hourly rate of the NMW.

PLP is usually provided by a person's employer where the person:

has been an employee of the employer for 12 months or more prior to the DOB or adoption of the child

will be an employee of the employer for their PPL period and, if the person has a continuous PPL period, for their continuous flexible period

is an Australian-based employee, and

expects to receive at least 40 consecutive week days of PLP from their employer (including PPL days and flexible PPL days).

In other cases, and for flexible PPL days that are not part of the person's continuous flexible period, Centrelink makes the payment of PLP directly to the parent.

Centrelink will provide DAPP to a claimant.

Interactions with other payments

A person receiving PLP cannot also receive

NBS

or

SBP

for the same child. In the case of a multiple birth, a person can receive PLP for one child and NBS or SBP (whichever is relevant) for a second or subsequent child.

A person who receives PLP will not be entitled to FTB Part B during the person's PPL period, their continuous flexible period, or on payable flexible PPL days.

DAPP and NBS or SBP can be received for the same child.

7.4 Guidance & appeals panel reviews

Introduction

The guidance and appeals panel (

1.1.G.30

) is a way of constituting the

ART

for a review at a more senior level. The guidance and appeals panel is able to conduct reviews of some administrative decisions made by agencies and re-review decision made by the ART.

The guidance and appeals panel will broadly be constituted to consider matters where there is either an issue of significance to administrative decision-making, or the ART decision contains an error of fact or law that materially affects the decision.

Applications for review of

PPL

claimant decisions cannot be made directly to the guidance and appeals panel, as the ART already accommodates for two reviews of such decisions (ART review and ART second review). However, the President of the ART may refer an application for an ART review or second review of an eligible ART reviewable claimant decision to the guidance and appeals panel on their own initiative.

Note:

Some elements of ART reviews relevant to reviewing PPL decisions, presented in pages under chapter

7.2

of this Guide, do not apply when in relation to a guidance and appeals panel application. Where the below contradicts information on ART reviews presented elsewhere, the below is correct in relation to guidance and appeals panel applications.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 225 Operation and implementation of decision under ART review, section 225A Remitting decisions for reconsideration, section 225C Legal or financial assistance

Own-initiative reviews

The president of the ART can refer an application for ART review of a PPL decision to the guidance and appeals panel on their own initiative where they are satisfied that the application raises an issue of significance to administrative decision-making or that it is appropriate in the interests of justice.

In making a referral for an issue of significance, the President of the ART must consider the circumstances of all of the parties to the ART review.

) may apply to the President of the ART to refer an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel.

Explanation:

Reviewable employer determination decisions and employer funding amount decisions are not eligible for a second review. However, reviewable claimant decisions are eligible (

7.3

). An application cannot be made to refer either a reviewable decision eligible for second review or a second review decision to the guidance and appeals panel. However, the President of the ART can still refer such a decision to the guidance and appeals panel on their own initiative.

Exception:

An application cannot be made for a guidance and appeals panel review of:

a previous guidance and appeals panel decision

a decision where at least one of the ART members making the decision is a Judge, or

a decision made along the terms of a signed written agreement between the parties to the ART review.

Making an application

An application can be made in writing to the President of the ART using the form available on the

ART website

. The application should include an explanation of why the person considers that the Tribunal decision raises an issue of significance to administrative decision making or may contain an error of fact or law materially affecting the decision. An application must be made within 28 days after the ART gives a statement of reasons for the decision to the parties in the ART review, although the President of the ART may allow for a longer period in special circumstances.

Once an application is received the President of the ART decides whether to refer the Tribunal decision to the guidance and appeals panel or refuse the application. A decision will only be referred where the President is satisfied that the Tribunal decision raises an issue of significance to administrative decision-making or may contain an error of fact or law materially affecting the decision. The President of the ART must also have regard to the circumstances of the parties to the initial ART review and any other matters they consider relevant. The decision will not be referred where there is an outstanding application fee.

Notification

Once an application to refer a Tribunal decision to the guidance and appeals panel is made, the ART must give written notice of the application to:

the applicant

the decision-maker of the original reviewable decision made by Centrelink

any other party to the ART review.

Note:

The decision-maker does not refer to the individual Centrelink officer who made the decision.

Once the President of the ART makes their decision on whether to refer the Tribunal decision or refuse the application, they must also give oral or written notice of this decision to the above persons.

Operation and implementation of the ART review decision on application

Applying for referral to the guidance and appeals panel does not automatically affect the operation of the Tribunal’s decision, or prevent the taking of action to implement the decision. However, once the application has been made, the Tribunal, on application by a party to the ART review, may make an order staying (or otherwise affecting) the operation or implementation of the decision if it considers it is desirable to do so. Such an order is subject to any conditions specified and, unless a different period is stated in the order, has effect until either 14 days after the President of the ART refers the decision or until they refuse the application if they do so.

Note:

Once the ART decision has been referred to the guidance and appeals panel, the Tribunal may further stay the operation or implementation of the reviewable decision for the purpose of ensuring the effectiveness of the review

The Tribunal will not make, vary or revoke a stay order until all parties to the ART review are given a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in relation to the matter and taken into account the interests of affected persons, unless the Tribunal is satisfied it is not practicable to give a party the opportunity. In such a case, the order, variation or revocation does not take effect until a notice setting out its terms is given to the party not given the opportunity.

Decision being reviewed

If the President of the ART decides to refer an employer determination or employer funding amount decision to the guidance and appeals panel in response to an application, then the person making the decision is taken to have applied for an ART review of the following decision:

for an original decision that has been affirmed by the ART-the original decision

for an original decision that has been varied by the ART-the original decision as varied

for an original decision that has been set aside and remade by the ART-the new decision, or

for an original decision that has been set aside and remitted to the decision maker by the ART-the original decision.

Note:

References to original decision refer to the decision made by Centrelink.

Parties to the review

If the President of the ART decides to refer a Tribunal decision to the guidance and appeals panel in response to an application, each of the following are parties to the guidance and appeals panel review:

the applicant for the review

the decision maker of the original decision (Centrelink)

any other parties to the original ART review (unless they have withdrawn from being a party or been removed as a party by the ART)

any other person, if

the person applies to the ART to become a party

the ART is satisfied that the person’s interests are affected by the decision, and

the ART considers it appropriate that the person become a party to the proceeding.

As with the ART review, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may become, on written notice, a party to the guidance and appeals panel review.

Records & documents from initial ART Review

If the President of the ART decides to refer a Tribunal decision to the guidance and appeals panel in response to an application, the guidance and appeals panel may have regard to:

any record of the ART review (including a record of any evidence taken)

any document or item given to the ART relating to the ART review, and

any order or recommendation of the ART during the ART review.

Act reference:

Remitting decisions to the decision-maker for reconsideration

At any time during the ART review, the ART may remit the decision being reviewed to the decision-maker asking them to reconsider the decision.

If the ART does so the decision-maker must reconsider the decision and either:

affirm the decision

vary the decision, or

set aside the decision and make a new decision in substitution for the decision set aside.

Once the decision has been reconsidered the ART review will resume with the reviewable decision being reviewed now being the decision as affirmed, varied or substituted rather than the decision the application was originally about.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 225A Remitting decisions for reconsideration

ARTAct

section 85 Tribunal may remit decision to decision-maker for reconsideration

Tribunal guidance decisions

Decisions of the ART on guidance and appeals panel reviews are Tribunal guidance decisions.

Exception:

The President of the ART may publicly declare in writing that a guidance and appeals panel review decision is an excluded decision to which the below does not apply.

When making future decisions on ART reviews with similar facts or issues to the Tribunal guidance decision, the ART must have regard to the relevant Tribunal guidance decision. However, a failure to have regard to previous Tribunal guidance decisions does not affect the validity of the ART review decision.

Exception:

If at least one of the member/s constituting the ART review is a Judge then they do not have to have regards to previous Tribunal guidance decisions.

4.3.4.10 Payment of PPL funding amounts

Introduction

Centrelink must pay one or more

PPL

funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to a person's employer (

1.1.E.50

) where satisfied that an instalment (

1.1.I.80

) was or is likely to be payable to the person and the employer is or is likely to be required to pay the instalment to the person. However, this does not require Centrelink to pay a PPL funding amount earlier than a reasonable period before the payroll cut-off for the instalment.

These rules ensure that PPL funding amounts are paid to employers who have accepted the decision that they are to provide

PLP

to a person (there is an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) in force for the employer and the person). The PPL funding amounts are paid to the employer in advance of the payroll cut-off for the payday for the instalment, thereby enabling the employer to pay the instalment in accordance with the employee's usual pay cycle. In practice, employers are likely to receive PPL funding amounts at least 2 days before their payroll cut-off, to ensure that instalments are able to be paid on the next available payday.

However, if the employer has not been paid enough to fund an instalment as at the payroll cut-off for an instalment, Centrelink must pay the required PPL funding amount to the employer before the next payroll cut-off for an instalment for the person.

If Centrelink fails to pay a PPL funding amount to an employer by the required time, the employer may appeal the PPL funding amount decision made by Centrelink.

5.2.2.40 Permission to claim flexible PPL days

Introduction

Some claimants require permission to claim flexible

PPL

days in order to be payable on a day.

The birth mother of a child may give permission to claim flexible PPL days for the child to:

the other parent of the child

the partner of the birth mother, and

the partner of the other parent of the child.

An adoptive parent who is payable for

PLP

for the child, or who has been nominated by the partner of an adoptive parent, may give permission to claim flexible PPL days for the child to:

a subsequent claimant adoptive parent, and

a partner of an adoptive parent.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances for whom a payability determination under the PPLAct section 13 that PLP is payable for the child is in force, may give permission to claim flexible PPL days for the child to their partner.

The permission must:

be given to Centrelink in the form required

specify the number of flexible PPL days that may be claimed, and

specify the person to whom the permission is given.

The permission does not preclude the person providing the permission from making a claim for some or all of the flexible PPL days specified in the permission.

Where a claimant requires permission to be payable, PLP will not be payable unless:

the appropriate person has given permission for that person to claim flexible PPL days

the permission has not been revoked, and

if the determination were made, the number of flexible PPL days that would be payable to the person would not exceed the number of flexible PPL days specified in the permission.

Note:

In order to be payable for PLP a person must be eligible on the relevant day. A person will not be eligible on a flexible PPL day if the maximum entitlement for the person or the child have been reached.

Note:

Some claimants require permission to make claims in order to make an effective claim (

4.1.6

).

Revocation of permission

A person who has given permission to claim flexible PPL days may vary or revoke that permission. The variation or revocation must be made in the form required by Centrelink.

Permission cannot be revoked for payable flexible PPL days that have already occurred (that is, past days).

Permission can been revoked for payable flexible PPL days that have not yet occurred. Where this occurs, Centrelink must vary the payability determination to remove the days that exceed the number of days specified in the permission as varied, and determine that PLP is not payable to the person for those days.

2.5.3 Person no longer caring for a child -  PLP remains payable

Introduction

PLP

remains payable where a person is not caring (

1.1.C.10

) for the child in the circumstances specified below.

Child stillborn or dies

An exception to the requirement for a claimant to be caring for the child exists in cases where the child is stillborn (

1.1.S.90

), or subsequently dies. In such a case, provided the individual establishes to the satisfaction of Centrelink that they would have been caring for the child but for the stillbirth or the child's death, they may claim, establish eligibility for, and be paid PLP as if the child had not died or been stillborn. In this situation, the claimant may perform more than one hour of paid work on a flexible

PPL

day (

1.1.F.70

) and remain eligible for PLP.

Birth mother ceases to care for the child

The PPL Rules provide a further exception to the requirement to be caring for the child, for a birth mother who is not caring for the child because the child was relinquished:

as part of the process for adoption of the child

because the child was born of a surrogacy arrangement, or

because the child was removed from her care by a state or territory child protection agency.

The birth mother can only be eligible on a day within:

20 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2023

22 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2024

24 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2025 and

26 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2026.

The birth mother may continue to be eligible for PLP provided they do not perform more than one hour of paid work on each day they are receiving PLP.

Where the birth mother intended to relinquish the child in any of the above circumstances, but the child was stillborn or has died, they may perform more than one hour of work on a flexible PPL day and retain eligibility.

Temporary inability to care (

1.1.T.50

)

A PPL claimant or special PPL claimant for PLP may remain eligible to receive PLP if they are temporarily unable to care for the child due to circumstances beyond their control, such as serious illness or where the person has to travel overseas for medical treatment.

Centrelink must be satisfied the person was or will be caring for the child. The period of temporary inability to care must be likely to be less than 26 weeks, and Centrelink must be satisfied the person would be caring for the child except for the temporary inability to care.

Loss of care for a child (

1.1.L.30

)

A PPL claimant or special PPL claimant for PLP may remain eligible to receive PLP even though they are temporarily unable to care for the child because an event occurs without the person's consent that prevents the child being in their care. For example, a child may not be returned after spending time with their other parent.

The person must have previously been caring for the child, and they or their partner must be the child's legal parent or must otherwise be legally responsible for the child.

The person must take steps to have the child returned to their care.

If the child is temporarily in the care of another legal parent, to remain eligible for PLP the person or their partner must have a court order or parenting plan to the effect that child is to live with the person or the person's partner.

1.1.E.60 Employer determination

Definition

Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

) is required to make an employer determination (that the person's employer is required to pay instalments of

PLP

) if Centrelink is satisfied of the following matters:

A payability determination that PLP is payable to the person or an initial eligibility determination for the person is in force in relation to the child.

Instalments are likely, if the determination is made, to be payable by the employer to the person for at least 40 consecutive days that are weekdays.

The person has been, or will have been, employed by the employer (or by the Commonwealth) for at least 12 months immediately before the expected

DOB

of the person's child where the person claims before the birth, or the later of the expected DOB and the day the child was born where the person claims after the birth.

The person has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) and is likely to be an Australian based employee of the employer during that period.

The person has not been found payable or initially eligible for any days before the person’s continuous flexible period.

The employer has an

ABN

.

Exception:

The requirement for an employer ABN does not apply to law enforcement officers (

1.1.L.10

), AFP officers (

1.1.A.67

) and defence force members (

1.1.D.70

).

Where more than one employer satisfies these requirements in relation to a person, Centrelink must make an employer determination for the employer nominated by the person.

In deciding whether to make an employer determination, Centrelink may assume that the state of affairs known at that time will remain unchanged.

Exception:

From 1 October 2016, Centrelink must not make an employer determination where the person is receiving an income support payment.

8.3.1 Delegation

DSS

Secretary delegation

To allow for efficient administration of the

PPL

scheme, given the volume of decisions to be made, the Secretary may, by signed instrument, delegate all or any of his or her powers under the PPLAct (other than the power under paragraph 128(1)(b)) to an 'officer' or a person engaged by:

an Agency

another authority of the Commonwealth, or

an organisation that performs services for the Commonwealth.

Officer is defined in the PPLAct to mean a person performing duties, or exercising powers or functions, under or in relation to the PPLAct.

The Secretary may also delegate all or any of his or her powers under the PPLAct, other than the power under paragraph 128(1)(b), to the Chief Executive Centrelink, the Chief Executive Medicare or an Australian Public Service (APS) employee in Services Australia.

The Secretary may only delegate his or her power under paragraph 128(1)(b), which relates to disclosing information to an agency head, to the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Chief Executive Medicare. If the Secretary delegates that power to the Chief Executive Centrelink or the Chief Executive Medicare, the Chief Executive cannot delegate the power to a Departmental employee (within the meaning of the

Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973

).

The Secretary also has powers and functions under Parts 4 and 5 of the

Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014

(Regulatory Powers Act). Part 4 of the Regulatory Powers Act deals with civil penalty provisions, and Part 5 deals with infringement notices. The Secretary may delegate his or her powers under Parts 4 and 5 of the Regulatory Powers Act as those powers apply to provisions of the PPLAct.

1.1.K.20 Known adoption

Definition

A known adoption involves a situation where a child has lived continuously with the prospective adoptive parent prior to the date on which the process of adoption is commenced and the adoption is more in the nature of formalising the parental relationship. In these cases, it would normally be expected that the child would not be regarded as being placed with the adoptive parent as part of the process of adoption, and hence such an adoptive parent would not be eligible for

PLP

. Known adoptions for

PPL

scheme purposes include step-child adoptions.

4.3.8.90 Period receiving PLP not a period of paid leave

Introduction

PLP

is not a leave entitlement. Where an employee receives instalments of PLP for all or part of a period that the employee is taking unpaid leave from the employer, it should not be treated as if that is a period (or part period) of paid leave. Whether an employee is taking unpaid or paid leave affects whether the employee is entitled to accrue certain entitlements, such as annual leave, notice of termination or redundancy pay, during that period. During a period of unpaid leave from the employer these entitlements do not accrue, even where the employee is receiving Government-funded PLP paid through their employer.

Note:

If an employee takes PLP at the same time as paid leave, receipt of PLP will not affect or interfere with the usual leave accrual arrangements that apply to the paid leave.

Determining where an underpaid amount is to be paid

If the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) (

1.1.C.125

) pays a

PPLSC

and the amount paid is less than the correct amount, the amount by which the correct amount exceeds the amount paid is the underpaid amount (

1.1.U.05

). The following table shows how the Commissioner determines where an underpaid amount is to be paid:

Person's circumstances

Where the underpaid amount is to be paid

The Commissioner is satisfied that the person is deceased.

1.1.L.20

).

The person has nominated an eligible account (

1.1.E.35

) to the Commissioner for the purpose of receiving a PPLSC.

The eligible account.

The person has one or more eligible accounts and has not nominated an eligible account to the Commissioner for the purpose of receiving a PPLSC.

if only one of the eligible accounts has received a PPLSC in the current or previous income year, that eligible account

if paragraph (a) does not apply, the eligible account:

with the greatest amount of eligible personal superannuation contributions (

1.1.E.35

), or

with the greatest amount of concessional contributions (

1.1.C.142

)

in the most recent financial year for which the Commissioner has received a statement in respect of the person from a superannuation provider (

1.1.S.98

)

if paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply, the person’s eligible account with the most recently opened account date

if paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) do not apply, the person’s eligible account with the highest account balance in the most recent financial year for which the Commissioner has received a statement in respect of the person from a superannuation provider, or

if paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) do not apply, the eligible account determined by the Commissioner.

The person does not have an eligible account.

An account of the person in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Special Account (

1.1.S.97

).

Note:

If 2 or more items of the table apply to an underpaid amount, only the item that is earliest in the table is to be used.

The Commissioner must make a determination in relation to an underpaid amount as soon as reasonably possible once they have sufficient information to determine that the underpaid amount is to be paid for the person for the income year and where the underpaid amount is to be paid.

The Commissioner may revoke a determination to pay an underpaid amount (as well as where the underpaid amount is to be paid) if they are satisfied that:

payment of the underpaid amount cannot be made in accordance with the determination, or

it is appropriate in the circumstances to revoke the determination.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 115K Underpayment determinations

PPL Rules

section 42 Determining where an underpaid amount of PPL superannuation contribution is to be directed

2.7 Who is a special PPL claimant for PLP?

Introduction

There are 2 types of special

PPL

claimants. They can be a person who is the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, or they can be a person in exceptional circumstances (

1.1.E.100

) as prescribed in the PPL Rules (

2.7.1

).

A special PPL claimant can only receive

PLP

when another person has made a successful PPL claim.

A special PPL claimant who is the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances (the first type of special PPL claimants), needs permission to claim PLP for the child from the PPL claimant. The PPL claimant must also give permission for the number of flexible PPL days the special PPL claimant can receive.

Special PPL claimant – partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances

Where a person has claimed PLP as a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, they can give permission for their partner to claim and receive some of the PLP where their partner is also caring for the child. The partner may claim PLP as a special PPL claimant.

Eligibility criteria

Special PPL claimants who are the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances must meet eligibility criteria relating to:

the work test (

1.1.W.30

)

the income test (

1.1.I.20

).

In addition, to be eligible on a flexible PPL day they must:

meet the Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

) on the day and on the

DOB

of the child

be caring for the child on the day (unless their child is stillborn or has died, or they are temporarily unable to care for their child or have lost care of their child without their consent), and

not be performing more than one hour of paid work on the day. This criteria not applicable in the following situations

if their child was stillborn or has died

if they have lost care of their child without their consent

if they are a defence force member or law enforcement officer and they have been compulsorily recalled to duty

if they are complying with the requirements of a summons or other compulsory process to appear

if they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker and they have returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency.

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

6.3.4.40 Payment of debt by arrangement

Summary

Centrelink may enter into a debt payment arrangement with a person who owes a debt. A debt payment arrangement requires the debtor to pay the outstanding amount of the debt by part payments in accordance with the terms of the arrangement.

A debt payment arrangement operates from the day stated in the arrangement as the day on which the arrangement starts (regardless of the actual day the arrangement is entered into). If the debt payment arrangement does not state what day the arrangement starts, then it is taken to operate on and after the day on which it is entered into.

Centrelink may terminate or alter a debt payment arrangement:

at the debtor's request

after giving 28 days' notice to the debtor of the proposed termination or alteration, or

without notice, if Centrelink is satisfied that the debtor has failed to disclose material information about their true capacity to repay the debt.

1.1.E.10 Effective claim

Definition

For the purposes of

PLP

, Centrelink cannot make a payability determination on a claim unless it is an effective claim.

An effective claim for PLP means a claim that is made in accordance with the PPLAct Part 2-4.

A PLP claim (incorporating both

PPL

and special PPL claims) is only effective if it is made by a person who can make a PPL or special PPL claim (section 54) and:

it meets the requirements for that type of claim (section 56)

if it is a PPL claim made before the birth, it contains information about the child's expected

DOB

(section 58)

it contains the claimant's

TFN

statement (section 59)

if the claim is made before the birth of the child, it is made no earlier than 97 days before the expected date of birth (section 60)

it specifies one or more days being claimed (subsection 57A(1))

the days specified occur before the child's second birthday, if an effective claim for PLP has been made before the child's first birthday, otherwise before the child's first birthday (section 60), and

if the person requires permission to make claims, that permission has been provided and has not been revoked (section 59A).

A special PPL claim can only be determined if there has been a payability determination made in relation to an effective PPL claim for the child (section 14).

If the claim is not effective, it is taken not to have been made. The decision that the claim is not effective can be reviewed. If the claimant still wants to test their eligibility, a new claim must be made.

4.3.4.20 Amount of PPL funding amount

Minimum

PPL

funding amount

A PPL funding amount (

1.1.P.180

) for a person must not be less than the sum of the amounts of instalments (

1.1.I.80

) that will have become payable to the person by the person's employer on the next payday after the PPL funding amount is paid that do not relate to days for which the employer (

1.1.E.50

) has already been paid a PPL funding amount. This is the minimum amount for a PPL funding amount (

1.1.M.20

).

Maximum PPL funding amount

A PPL funding amount for a person cannot exceed the sum of the minimum amount (the amount payable to the person by the person's employer on the next pay day after the PPL funding amount is paid) and the equivalent of 6 weeks (30 days) advance of the person's instalments.

This rule enables an employer to be paid 4 PPL funding amounts to cover a 20-week continuous flexible period, rather than being paid PPL funding amounts on a fortnightly cycle. Six weekly funding amounts may be chosen by employers if that would be simpler for them administratively.

The sum of PPL funding amounts paid to the employer must not be more than the total amounts of instalments that would be payable to the person by the person's employer.

1.1.U.10 Unreasonable for a person to care for a child

Definition

Where Centrelink is considering a

PPL

claim or special PPL claim for

PLP

in exceptional circumstances, Centrelink may need to be satisfied that it would be unreasonable for another person to care for the child because:

there has been extreme family breakdown, or similar circumstances, in relation to the family situation in which the other person has cared, or would care, for the child, or

there is a serious risk to the child's physical or mental wellbeing from violence, neglect or sexual abuse in the family situation in which the other person has cared, or would care, for the child.

6.1.1.20 Gathering information relating to tax file numbers

Introduction

Centrelink has the power to obtain from the Commissioner of Taxation information (including a

TFN

) about a person who has made an effective claim for

PLP

that is relevant to their claim and contained in a TFN declaration lodged with the Commissioner.

Purpose for which TFNs may be used

A TFN, provided under and for the purposes of the PPLAct by the claimant, their partner, or by the Commissioner of Taxation (on authority of the person, or when required by Centrelink), may be used only for the following purposes:

to detect cases where instalments of PLP have been paid when they should not have been paid, and

to verify in relation to persons who have made effective claims for PLP, the eligibility of those persons for that pay.

Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015

The Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 (TFN Rule), made under the

Privacy Act 1988

section 17, regulates the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of individuals' TFN information.

A breach of the TFN Rule is an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner. Where a breach of privacy is very serious, the Information Commissioner may seek to impose a penalty.

As well as constituting a breach of the TFN Rule, unauthorised use or disclosure of TFNs may constitute an offence under the

Taxation Administration Act 1953

, with a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units or 2 years imprisonment, or both. The value of a penalty unit is published on the

Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s website under Fines and Penalties

.

Services Australia is an authorised recipient of TFN information for the purposes set out in the PPLAct.

More detailed information about privacy and the TFN Rule is available at the

OAIC's website

, and TFN queries or enquiries can be directed to the DSS Feedback and Complaints team using the following contact details:

4.1.9 Claims for PLP & NBS for the same child

Introduction

This topic explains the arrangements that apply when a claimant lodges a claim for both

PLP

and

NBS

for a child, as part of their claim for

FTB

.

If a person lodges an FTB claim for a child and they may be eligible for both PLP and NBS, NBS will not be paid if the person has also claimed PLP or they have indicated their intention to claim PLP.

Where a person has indicated their intention to claim PLP and has not done so within 26 weeks of the FTB claim being granted or they change their intention to claim PLP, NBS is paid automatically.

If it is determined that PLP is payable to a person for a child, the claimant will not be eligible to receive NBS for that child. If it is determined that PLP is not payable to the person for the child, then a determination may be made to include NBS in the person's FTB Part A rate.

In addition, where PLP is payable to a person for a child, NBS is not payable to another person who was partnered to that person for one or more days on which they were payable. See FA Guide

2.2.3

for further details.

1.1.V.10 Verifies a child's birth

Definition

Centrelink cannot make a determination that

PLP

is payable to a claimant for a newborn child, unless the child's birth has been verified.

For the purposes of PLP the claimant verifies the child's birth if the claimant:

provides proof that the child was born, and

is a parent (other than an adoptive parent) of the child and the child is not stillborn, and the parent is required under state and territory law to register the birth of the child, then the claimant must give information that the child's birth has been registered or that the claimant has applied to have the child's birth registered.

Centrelink may approve a birth verification form for the purposes of verifying the birth of a child. For PLP purposes the claim form process includes an approved birth verification form.

Where the child is an adopted child, the claimant or another person, must provide information required by Centrelink about the adoption of the child.

1.2.1 PPL scheme objectives

Introduction

The objectives of the

PPL

scheme are to:

signal that taking time out of the paid workforce to care for a child is part of the usual course of life and work for both parents

promote equality between men and women and balance between work and family life, and

provide financial support to parents caring for children, in order to

allow those parents to take time off work to care for the child after the child’s birth or adoption

enhance the health and development of birth mothers and children

encourage women to continue to participate in the workforce

provide those parents with flexibility to balance work and family life

increase the time that fathers and partners take off work around the time of birth or adoption

create further opportunities for fathers and partners to bond with their child

allow fathers and partners to take a greater share of caring responsibilities and to support mothers and partners from the beginning, and

reduce the long-term financial impact of taking time off work to care for the child by adding to the superannuation balances of those parents.

The financial support provided by the PPL scheme is intended to complement and supplement existing entitlements to paid or unpaid leave in connection with the birth or adoption of a child.

7.3 Second review of claimant decisions

Introduction

A person has the right to seek a review if they are not satisfied with a decision of Centrelink. Where an individual does not understand a decision, they can request an explanation of the decision, which will be provided by a subject matter expert within Centrelink. Where an individual does not agree with a decision, they can apply for a formal review of the decision which will be undertaken by an

ARO

.

Following a review by an ARO, an external review of a decision can be undertaken by the

ART

. A person whose interests are affected by an ART reviewable claimant decision can apply for a second review of the decision.

Exception:

An application for second review cannot be made if the ART reviewable claimant decision was made in accordance with a signed written agreement between the parties to the ART review.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 131D Who can apply

Decision to be reviewed

The ART reviewable claimant decision being reviewed in a second review is for an ART reviewable claimant decision that has been:

affirmed by the ART - the decision as affirmed

varied by the ART - the decision as varied

set aside and remade by the ART - the decision as remade, or

set aside and remitted to the decision maker by the ART- the decision as set aside.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 131D Who can apply

Features of a second review

An application for second review proceeds largely the same as an ART review (

7.2.1

) with some modifications and clarifications.

References to the decision maker should be taken to mean the decision maker of the initially reviewed decision rather than the ART itself. In most cases this would mean 'the Secretary' is considered the decision maker for the second review.

The decision maker is not required to give the ART a statement of reasons and relevant documents within 28 days after being notified of the second review application (

7.2.3

).

An application for second review of a claimant decision cannot be made by a person in their capacity as an employer.

An application for second review must be made within 28 days after the ART review decision is made, unless a longer period has been set out in ART rules or a person has applied to the ART to extend the period and the ART has ordered the period extended.

The parties to the second review include the persons who were parties to the initial ART review (

7.2.1

) unless they have given written notice to the ART of their wishes to withdraw from being a party (and are neither the applicant nor decision maker) or the ART has removed them as a party for failing to appear or not complying. Employers are also not able to apply to be a party to a second review of a claimant decision. The President of the ART must give written notice to each participating party to the second review that the second review has commenced.

Once an application has been made for ART review or second review, the decision being reviewed cannot be altered except by the Tribunal, unless the variation has been consented to by all parties to the review and the ART, and the decision has been remitted to Centrelink.

Generally, although listed as a party to an ART review, Centrelink has elected not to participate in an ART review (although they can still be required to participate by the Tribunal). However, for a second review, Centrelink is not taken to have automatically provided an election notice not to participate and will generally participate in ART second review proceedings.

The ART may have regard to any records of the initial ART review as well as any evidence taken or documents/things given to the ART or any order or recommendation of the ART made during the earlier review.

At any time during the second review, the ART may remit the decision being reviewed to the decision maker asking them to reconsider the decision. Once the decision has been reconsidered the ART review will resume with the reviewable decision being reviewed now being the decision as affirmed, varied or substituted rather than the decision the application was originally about.

A person party to the ART review cannot make an application to refer either the ART's decision in the ART review or the second review decision to the guidance and appeals panel (

1.1.G.30

). However, the ART President may still, on their own initiative, refer an application to the guidance and appeals panel.

Generally, a party to the ART review wishing to refer the ART's decision to the Federal Court has 28 days from the ART providing a statement of its reasons for its decision to do so. However, any day between the day the second review application is made and the ART responds to the application is not counted towards this 28 day period. This ensures a person’s ability to refer a decision to the Federal Court is not affected by the ART's administration.

Guidance & appeals panel reviews

Operation & implementation of the ART review decision on second review

Applying for second review does not automatically affect the operation of the Tribunal's decision or prevent the taking of action to implement the decision. However, once the application has been made, the Tribunal, on application by a party to the second review, may make an order staying (or otherwise affecting) the operation or implementation of either decision if it considers it is desirable to do so. Such an order is subject to any conditions specified and, unless a different period is stated in the order, has effect until the decision of the Tribunal on second review comes into operation.

The Tribunal on second review will not make, vary or revoke a stay order until all parties to the ART review are given a reasonable opportunity to make submissions in relation to the matter and taken into account the interests of affected persons, unless the Tribunal is satisfied it is not practicable to give a party the opportunity. In such a case, the order, variation or revocation does not take effect until a notice setting out its terms is given to the party not given the opportunity.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 32 Reviewable decision continues to operate unless Tribunal orders otherwise, section 131V Operation and implementation of decision on second review

ART decisions on second review

The ART has the same decision making powers to resolve a second review as they have in relation to the initial ART review. These include:

dismissing the application (and subsequently reinstating it if neccesary)

making a decision agreed to by the parties

affirming the reviewable decision

varying the reviewable decision

setting aside the reviewable decision, and

making a decision in substitution for the reviewable decision, or

remitting the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration in accordance with any orders or recommendations of the Tribunal.

1.4.3.10 Duty of care when giving advice or information

Giving advice or information

Duty of care with regard to advice involves the performance of duties to a reasonable standard of care. 'Reasonable' generally means a standard of care expected of reasonably prudent public servants administering legislation consistent with sound administrative practices.

The consequences of incorrect advice are the same whether the advice is given orally or in writing, so the same degree of care must be taken. Care must be taken to ensure that oral advice is expressed clearly enough for the person to understand, taking into account any obvious educational and language barriers.

Advice or action outside department's area of expertise

Services Australia officers are often asked to provide information about other government departments or agencies. It is important to make the individual aware that the enquiry is outside the expertise of Services Australia and although Services Australia will offer whatever assistance is possible, the individual should make enquiries directly with the appropriate department or agency for authoritative advice or action.

Negligent advice

The question of whether negligence occurred depends on the particular facts of each case. Duty of care is not breached simply because advice is wrong. The duty is only to exercise reasonable care when giving advice. As a rule, carelessness will constitute a breach of duty of care.

A person will usually not be able to establish that they have suffered economic loss because of negligent advice if the person has acted on the response to a general enquiry they made.

2.2.1 When a person satisfies the work test for PLP

Introduction

To meet the work test for

PLP

, a person must have performed, whether in Australia or not, 330 hours of qualifying work (

1.1.Q.20

) over a period spanning at least 295 days (around 10 months) within the person's work test period.

The work test period for people other than COVID-19 affected claimants is the 392-day period (around 13 months) prior to the expected or actual

DOB

or placement of the child for adoption.

The work test period for a

PPL

claimant in exceptional circumstances and their partner is the 392-day period prior to the expected or actual date the PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances became the primary carer of the child.

There is an extended work test period of 600 days for claimants who are COVID-19 affected claimants (

1.1.C.165

).

When a person satisfies the work test for PLP

Step

Method statement

1

Work out the person's work test period (

1.1.W.40

) under PPLAct section 33 for people other than COVID-19 affected claimants, or section 33A for COVID-19 affected claimants.

2

Work out the days in the work test period on which the person has and has not performed qualifying work.

3

Work out whether any days on which the person has not performed qualifying work during the work test period fall within a permissible break (

1.1.P.130

).

4

Work out whether there is a period (a qualifying period (

1.1.Q.10

)) of 295 consecutive days in the work test period that are days:

on which the person has performed qualifying work, or

that fall within a permissible break.

5

If the person has performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work in a qualifying period, the person satisfies the work test.

Where a birth mother does not meet the work test because they ceased work due to hazards connected to their work that posed a risk to their pregnancy, the birth mother will meet the work test if they have performed 330 hours of qualifying work over a period of 295 consecutive days within the 392 day period prior to the day the birth mother is no longer performing work in the hazardous job (

2.2.3

).

From 30 March 2020, a day on which a person is entitled to jobkeeper payment can count as a day of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

For claims on or after 4 September 2021, a day on which a person is entitled to the COVID-19 disaster payment from 3 June 2021 can count as a day of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

Centrelink may determine that a person who is a birth mother, the other parent of the child or the partner of the birth mother has met the work test if:

the child was born prematurely, and

Centrelink is satisfied that the person would have satisfied the work test on the day in accordance with section 32 (the work test), if not for the premature birth (

2.2.5)

.

Note:

This exception to the work test does not apply to adoptive parents.

Additionally, Centrelink may determine that a person who is a birth mother has met the work test if while they were pregnant with the child, they had complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented them from performing paid work, and Centrelink is satisfied that the person would have satisfied the work test on the day if the circumstances had not existed (

2.2.5

).

A claimant for PLP may also satisfy the work test if Centrelink is satisfied that:

special circumstances applied in relation to the person, and

the person would have satisfied the work test if those circumstances had not existed.

The special circumstances are the:

person is experiencing family and domestic violence, or is dealing with the impact of family and domestic violence, that prevents the person from performing paid work

person is affected by a severe medical condition that prevents them from performing paid work

person is caring for a family member who is affected by a severe medical condition and providing such care prevents the person from performing paid work, or

person is severely affected by a Commonwealth, state or territory declared natural disaster that prevents the person from performing paid work. (

2.2.6

).

5.1.5 Giving information after review of employer determination for PLP

Introduction

Where an employer has applied for review of a Centrelink decision to make an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

), Centrelink must give the employer written notice requiring the employer to provide Centrelink with a written notice containing the employer's bank account details and pay cycle information for the person if:

either

the application is withdrawn, or

the employer determination has not been set aside and is no longer subject to review, and

the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) for the child has not ended. The notice given to the employer must be dated, with the date being the date the preparation of the notice was completed.

The employer is required to provide the bank account and pay cycle information within 14 days of the date of Centrelink's notice.

An employer must comply with this requirement. A failure to comply may result in a financial penalty.

6.3.6.60 Waiver of debts - special circumstances

Summary

All or part of a debt may be waived where the circumstances make debt recovery inequitable. This is provided special circumstances exist (other than financial hardship alone) that make it desirable to waive the debt, it is more appropriate to waive than to write off the debt, and any ONE of the following applies:

The debt did not result (wholly or partly) from the debtor or another person knowingly making a false statement or a false representation, or failing or omitting to comply with a provision of the PPLAct.

The debt resulted (wholly or partly) from such an act, failure or omission by the debtor, but that act, failure or omission was justified in the circumstances.

The debt resulted (wholly or partly) from such an act, failure or omission by another person, but the debtor

did not know about the act, failure or omission, or

was justified in the circumstances for not correcting the act, failure or omission.

Although the debt may not be waived where financial hardship is the only special circumstance, it may still be written off (

1.1.W.60

) under the PPLAct section 193.

The special circumstances waiver requires discretionary decisions to be made based on the facts of individual cases.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 193 When debts can be written off, section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

Policy reference:

PPL Guide

6.3.5

Writing off debts

When it is desirable to waive a debt

In

Davy and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations

(2007) AATA 1114

, the

AAT

held that:

‘special circumstances’ are not merely directed to the person's own circumstances. Rather they are directed to those that are 'special circumstances … that make it desirable to waive'. That necessarily requires a consideration of the person's individual circumstances but also a consideration of the general administration of the social security system.

The integrity of the social security system, which includes the PPL scheme, relies on recovery of debts. In general, if a person had the use and advantage of the money paid incorrectly to them and has the means to repay it without excessive hardship, they should do so.

The special circumstances waiver is appropriate only if the person's particular circumstances make it unfair for that general principle to apply. The debtor’s circumstances need to distinguish their situation from that of the many other people who do have to repay their debts.

When it is more appropriate to write off a debt

In applying the special circumstances waiver, Centrelink must consider whether it is more appropriate to waive the debt than write off the debt.

A debt may only be written off in certain circumstances (

6.3.5

).

It may be more appropriate to write off the debt for a period of time if the debtor’s circumstances limiting their capacity to repay the debt are likely to be temporary and recovery of the debt would be possible and desirable in future.

If the debtor’s only special circumstances are financial hardship, the debt cannot be waived under the special circumstances waiver. In these circumstances it may be more appropriate to write off the debt for a period of time.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 193 When debts can be written off, section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

Waiving a debt in full or in part

The special circumstances waiver is not ‘all or nothing’. The special circumstances waiver can be used to reduce part of a person’s debt (for example, by 20% or 50%, or by a fixed amount) where Centrelink considers recovery of the full debt amount would not be desirable, but some recovery is still warranted.

Where appropriate, the proportion waived can have regard to the proportion of the debt that is affected by the person’s circumstances that are considered special.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

What are special circumstances

In

Beadle and Director-General of Social Security

(1984) 1 AATA 176

, the AAT held that 'an expression such as special circumstances is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition'. Further, the AAT held that the adjective ‘special’ in ‘special circumstances’ 'looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur'. As such, when deciding on special circumstances, Centrelink must consider the person’s circumstances in their entirety.

Circumstances can be considered unusual, uncommon or exceptional when taken in context or in combination with other circumstances. The impact of the circumstances on the individual should also be considered when considering whether circumstances are sufficiently special.

Explanation:

Family and domestic violence is experienced by many people. This does not preclude it from being considered as part of determining whether special circumstances exist, in the context of how it has affected a specific individual and their broader circumstances.

The decision to apply special circumstances should take into account all of the person's circumstances and would usually be based on a combination of factors. This could include factors such as family and domestic violence or addiction or dependence on drugs, alcohol or gambling. See

Factors historically considered when applying the special circumstances waiver

for more information below.

The circumstances being considered by Centrelink can relate to any time period. The special circumstances do not need to relate to the cause of the debt. Centrelink may decide that it is desirable to waive the debt because the person had special circumstances when the debt arose, or during the period the debt was identified, raised for recovery and repaid. Centrelink may also decide that it is desirable to waive the debt because the person is currently experiencing special circumstances.

Example:

A debtor has a

PPL

debt from 3 years ago. Recently, they applied for a review of their debt. Centrelink determined that while the debtor had the capacity to repay the debt at the time it was incurred, they found the debtor had special circumstances at the time of review, as they were experiencing homelessness, and their PPL debt was waived.

There is nothing in PPLAct section 199 that limits the broad discretion available to Centrelink to determine that a person's circumstances are special enough circumstances that make it desirable to waive the debt.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

Interaction of 'administrative error' & special circumstances

Sole administrative error by the Commonwealth, considered on its own, would not generally lead to a special circumstances waiver. Section 195 of the PPLAct is a specific waiver provision for debts attributable solely to an administrative error.

However, taken in context, an administrative error may sometimes combine with other circumstances to create a situation that is, overall, special.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 195 Waiver of debts—administrative error, section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

The interpretation of ‘knew’ & 'knowingly' for the purposes of PPLAct section 199

PPLAct section 199 requires Centrelink to determine whether the debt arose because the debtor, or another person, knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of the PPLAct.

In such situations where the debt resulted from such an act, failure or omission by another person, Centrelink is also required to consider whether the debtor knew about that act, failure or omission. If the debtor did know about the other person’s act, failure or omission, then Centrelink is required to consider whether it was justified in the circumstances for the debtor not to correct that act, failure or omission.

Decisions regarding 'knowingly', ‘know’ and 'knew' should be based on an assessment of what the debtor or another person actually knew in the particular case.

In

Callaghan and Secretary, Department of Social Security

(1996) 45 ALD 435

, the AAT held that where the debtor has actual knowledge not merely constructive knowledge, that their statements or representations are false, or that they did not comply with the provisions of the various (social security) acts, they will have knowingly committed these acts. Actual knowledge is to be ascertained by reference to the statements of the person as to his or her actual state of knowledge at the time and to events surrounding the false statement or the act or omission.

In

Jonauskas; Secretary, Department of Families and Community Services

(2001) AATA 72

, Deputy President Forgie reiterated the position she had adopted in Re Callaghan that knowingly in the context of SSAct section 1237AAD 'is a deliberate choice and means actual knowledge' (at (73)). It does not encompass reckless disregard, although recklessness could be relevant in determining whether special circumstances existed.

In

Nisha and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services

(2000) AATA 315

the Applicant’s son was born with disability and had ongoing health issues that required medical treatment. This caused the Applicant to experience depression. The Tribunal found that while the Applicant had the opportunity to advise of a change in her circumstances, her capacity to properly consider her situation and deal with her responsibilities was severely impaired and reduced. The Tribunal found that although the Applicant failed to meet her obligations, this was not done so knowingly, given her impaired capacity to understand and meet her obligations.

It is a civil standard of proof, whether on the balance of probabilities whether the debtor knowingly made a conscious and deliberate choice.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

The interpretation of 'justified in the circumstances' for the purposes of PPLAct section 199

In situations where a debtor knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of the PPLAct, in connection with the debt, the special circumstances waiver can only be applied if the debtor’s act, failure or omission was 'justified in the circumstances'.

In situations where another person knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of the PPLAct, in connection with the debt, and the debtor knew about that act, failure or omission, the special circumstances waiver can only be applied if it was justified in the circumstances that the debtor did not correct that act, failure or omission.

In considering whether a debtor was justified in the circumstances Centrelink will be required to consider the person’s circumstances in their entirety, including the circumstances resulting in the debt. ‘Justified’ is interpreted as having its ordinary meaning, that is ‘acceptable or having good cause or reason’ or ‘to show a satisfactory reason or excuse for something done’.

This means, in relation to the cause of the relevant debt, for the debtor’s conduct to be justified, Centrelink must be satisfied that the person’s circumstances provide an acceptable or satisfactory reason warranting that conduct. This is a subjective test based on the circumstances of the particular case and will include considering the personal perspective of the debtor and what they considered when deciding how to act, or not act, in particular circumstances.

The debtor is not required to 'justify' how the circumstances impacted their decision-making or conduct. There is no burden on the debtor to justify their state of mind.

Example:

A person makes a false statement to Centrelink because they feared violence from their partner if they did not do so. A debt arises from this false statement. When considering waiving the debt on the basis of special circumstances, the person is not required to justify or prove to the decision maker their fear of violence, or the credibility of that fear. The decision maker only needs to consider whether, given the person’s fear of violence, the person’s actions were justified.

Whether the debtor’s conduct is justified in the circumstances where they acted knowingly is to be considered separately to whether there are special circumstances that make it desirable to waive the debt.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 199 Waiver of debts—special circumstances

Factors historically considered when applying the special circumstances waiver

In

Secretary, Department of Social Security v Paul Raymond Hulls

(1991) 13 AAR 414, the Federal Court of Australia held that it is not possible to set out a complete list of the relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether special circumstances exist. Each case must be considered on its own merits.

Factors that have historically been considered as part of broader determinations of whether special circumstances exist at the

ART

(

1.1.A.50

) and Federal Court of Australia, and could be considered as part of determining whether a person’s conduct was ‘justified in the circumstances', include, but are not limited to:

the person’s physical and mental health

the person’s decision-making capacity

the person’s financial circumstances, including any debts and pending expenses

the person’s living situation, including any experience of homelessness or housing insecurity

the person’s addiction or dependence on drugs, alcohol or gambling

the person’s obligations and responsibilities, including caring responsibilities

the presence of family and domestic violence, financial abuse or coercion

the impact of external events and factors, including emergencies and disasters

the impact of cultural and language barriers, or the specific involvement of nominees or third parties.

Any notional entitlement the person may have had to another payment during the debt period can also be considered a special circumstance, as per the Federal Court of Australia in

Oberhardt v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations

(2008) FCA 1923

.

In essence, the term 'notional entitlement' refers to an unclaimed benefit, a benefit which was not actually claimed by the person, but to which that person would have been entitled had they applied for it. The Federal Court reasoned that ‘notional entitlement’ should not be excluded from the range of relevant considerations in deciding whether there are special circumstances to waive a debt.

In

VLYK; Secretary, Department of Social Services and (Social services second review)

(2021) AATA 2774

the Tribunal found that VLYK’s debt could be waived in part due to special circumstances, stating the reasoning from

Wilson and Secretary, Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Anor

(2012) AATA 15

'that the likelihood that the Applicant would have received a similar benefit supports a conclusion that his circumstances were out of the ordinary'.

What evidence is required of a person’s circumstances

Centrelink should make decisions on whether to apply the special circumstances waiver based on the evidence available and the circumstances of the individual case. This includes considering, where appropriate:

the debtor’s own statements and account of events

indicators and details on the debtor’s record, such as notes of previous contact with Centrelink, partnered status, income and assets, homelessness, mental health, or social worker involvement

contemporaneous evidence provided by the debtor, for example bank statements, insurance claims or police or court documents (such as a family safety intervention order)

verification of the debtor’s circumstances from other sources, for example support services, counsellors, doctors, accommodation providers or social workers

any other evidence that could assist in applying the special circumstances waiver.

Statements made by a debtor should generally be considered a truthful account of their circumstances, unless contradictory evidence is obtained. It may be appropriate for Centrelink to request additional evidence from the debtor to verify their circumstances in some instances, for example if:

the amount of debt being considered for possible waiver is particularly large

there is reason for Centrelink to doubt the truthfulness of the debtor’s account (for example, where they are aware of contradictory evidence about the debtor’s circumstances)

the circumstances of the debt or debtor warrant additional verification or evidence.

Requests for additional evidence of a debtor’s circumstances should consider the administrative impost of such a request, particularly if they relate to circumstances that occurred long ago. The debtor should not be required to re-provide evidence already evident from their customer record.

Where additional evidence is no longer available, but Centrelink considers the debtor’s account alone is insufficient, a Commonwealth statutory declaration observed by an approved witness outlining the circumstances in question can be considered sufficient evidence of those circumstances. Intentionally making a false statement in a statutory declaration carries a penalty of up to 4 years in prison.

For the purposes of the

PPL

scheme, instalment means an instalment of

PLP

.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 6 The Dictionary

If an instalment period is to be paid by an employer and there is a regular period for which the person is usually paid in relation to their performance of work, then the person's instalment period is that regular period and the payday for the instalment is the day on which the person is usually paid.

A payday could be before, during or after the instalment period to which the instalment relates, depending on when the employer would usually pay the person for their work.

If there is not a regular pay period, then the instalment period is each calendar month and the payday for the instalment is the first day after the end of the relevant calendar month.

If an instalment is to be paid by Centrelink (

1.1.C.20

), then the person's instalment period is the period of 14 days starting on the day Centrelink considers appropriate and each successive 14-day period, and the payday is a day after the end of the instalment period considered appropriate by Centrelink.

4.3.2.35 Deductions from PLP to avoid overpayment of ISP

Introduction

From 1 October 2016, where a person is in receipt of an income support payment (ISP) and is granted

PLP

in arrears which may result in an overpayment of their ISP, Centrelink may deduct an ISP overpayment amount from a person's PLP arrears instalment (

1.1.I.80

) to avoid a debt. This is because PLP is counted as income for income support payment purposes (

1.2.2.20

).

Only the overpayment amount due to the assessment of PLP under the ISP income test can be deducted from PLP arrears. Overpayments of ISP for other reasons, or for the person's partner, cannot be deducted.

Example:

Lily works 10 hours a week and also receives

DSP

. She gives birth to her first baby on 1 November 2019. Lily lodges a claim for PLP on 25 November 2019 which is granted from 1 November 2019. To avoid an overpayment of Lily's DSP received for the period 1 November to 25 November, Centrelink deducts the calculated overpayment amount from her lump sum PLP arrears payment.

1.1.S.55 Special PPL claim

Definition

There are 2 types of

PLP

claims: a

PPL

claim and a special PPL claim.

Centrelink cannot make a determination that PLP is payable to a person for a child unless the person has made an effective PPL claim or an effective special PPL claim. Only a person can make a PLP claim.

A special PPL claim may only be made by:

the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, or

a person who satisfies the circumstances that are prescribed by the PPL Rules as being exceptional circumstances in which a special PPL claim can be made.

A special PPL claimant is not payable for PLP unless a PPL claimant has already been found payable for the child.

A claim must be made in the form approved and the manner required by Centrelink for that type of claim, contain any information required by Centrelink, and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink.

The partner of a person making a PPL claim in exceptional circumstances cannot make an effective special PPL claim without permission to make a claim from the PPL claimant, and is only payable for the number of days they have been given permission to claim.

In order to be eligible for

PLP

on a flexible

PPL

day a person must not be performing more than one hour of paid work (

Exceptions

There are exceptions to the requirement not to be performing more than one hour of paid work on a day, as follows:

The child is stillborn (

1.1.S.90

) or has died before that day.

The person is a defence force member or law enforcement officer who is performing paid work because they have been compulsorily recalled to duty (

The work can be disregarded if it occurs within the period that starts 14 days after the child is born and ends on the day the child is discharged from hospital.

The child must have been hospitalised because either, the child was born prematurely, the child developed a complication or contracted an illness during their period of gestation or at birth, or the child developed a complication or contracted an illness following their birth.

The person is the parent of the child that is not the birth mother, the partner of that person or the partner of the birth mother, and the child is required to remain in hospital or is hospitalised immediately after their birth.

7.2.2 ART review of employer decisions

Introduction

ART

review is available for certain reviewable employer determination decisions (

1.1.E.70

) and employer funding amount decisions (

1.1.E.80

). An employer may apply for an ART review of an ART reviewable employer decision (

1.1.A.03

).

Note:

Applications for a review of a related ART reviewable employer decision can only be made by an employer, precluding claimants from applying.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Part 5-2 Division 3 ART review of employer decisions

ART reviewable employer decision

An ART reviewable employer decision is an employer decision as affirmed, or varied, or substituted as a result of the internal review process, or an employer decision made personally by a

PPL

agency representative.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 223 Application of this Division (ART Review of employer decisions)

Policy reference:

Internal review of employer determination decision,

7.1.2.30

Variation of original decision after application is made for ART review

Generally, once an application for review has been made, an original decision cannot be altered except by the ART. However, an officer can vary or substitute an employer decision after an application has been made for an ART review of the decision, as long as:

the President of the ART has not referred the application to the guidance and appeals panel

if a valid application has already been made for the employer decision to be referred to the guidance and appeals panel, the varied or substituted employer decision is made before the guidance and appeals panel is constituted.

Once changed, the decision as varied or substituted, rather than the original decision, becomes the decision under ART review.

Policy reference:

Guidance & appeals panel reviews

Form of application for review

An application to the ART for a review of a decision may be made in writing to the ART or in another manner specified in the practice directions of the ART. The application to the ART must include the information specified for the application in the practice directions although missing information does not automatically invalidate an application.

Applications can be made on a person's behalf by someone else.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 34 How to apply, section 35 Applications may be made on behalf of a person

Timing of application for review

An employer must apply for ART review within 14 days after the day on which the ART reviewable employer decision was made.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 224(4) An application referred to …

Parties to a review

Generally, the parties to an ART employer decision review are:

the employer

the decision-maker (the Secretary of the

DSS

)

any other person if they apply to the ART to become a party and the ART is satisfied their interests are affected by the decision and it is appropriate for them to become a party.

Note:

A claimant is not automatically a party to an ART employer decision review. However, they are not prevented from applying to the ART to be a party.

Note:

If a party, who is neither the applicant nor a non-participating party, fails to appear or comply with an order of the ART (which was reasonable) then the ART may order they cease to be a party to the ART review. They can be reinstated at a later time if the ART wishes.

Generally, although listed as a party to an ART review, the Secretary has elected not to participate in an ART review. The decision-maker can still give written submissions to the ART but will not participate directly in hearings.

Note:

The Tribunal can still require a decision-maker to participate in the ART review despite them electing not to participate.

Exception:

The decision maker is a participating party:

Where the decision maker has provided a written notice that they wish to participate and the ART has decided to accept the request.

The ART have ordered the decision-maker to participate.

The ART review is a guidance and appeals panel review.

The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth may elect to become a party in matters of significant public importance, where the outcome of the matter might have significant implications for the development of the law or the community more broadly (going beyond the interests and concerns of the parties directly involved in the ART review).

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 224A Person who made the decision, section 224B Decision-maker taken to have elected not to participate in ART review proceeding

section 22 Parties to proceeding for review, section 62 Tribunal may allow non-participating party to participate, section 63 Non-participating party may give submissions or be required to participate, section 83 Tribunal may remove party from proceeding if party fails to appear or does not comply

Further review options

Unlike claimant decisions, employer decisions are not considered eligible social services decisions for a second review in the ART. This means that, while a second review is not available, in addition to the President referring the ART's decision to the guidance and appeals panel, a party to the review (including both the employer or Centrelink) may apply to the guidance and appeals panel (

1.1.G.30

) for review of the ART's decision.

5.2 Initial eligibility & payability determinations for PLP

Introduction

In addition to employer determinations (

5.1

), claims for

PLP

are subject to payability determinations and initial eligibility determinations.

Initial eligibility determinations can be made by Centrelink if a payability determination that PLP is payable cannot yet be made on the claim, for example, because the claim has been lodged prior to the birth of the child. Centrelink can make an initial eligibility determination if satisfied that the person satisfies, or will satisfy, particular eligibility criteria.

Centrelink must make a payability determination about whether PLP is payable to a person if the person has made an effective claim.

Different rules apply depending on the type of claim and claimant.

There are restrictions that apply to prevent Centrelink from making a payability determination that PLP is payable in some circumstances. There are also general provisions that apply to payability determinations.

1.1.D.50 Debt, debtor

Definition: debt

Generally, if a person has been paid more

PLP

than was payable to them, the excess amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth. If an employer is paid

PPL

funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) and an equivalent amount is not paid as PLP instalments (

1.1.I.80

), the amount not paid is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the employer.

If a trustee (

1.1.T.100

) of a complying superannuation fund (

1.1.C.141

) or provider (

1.1.P.275

) of an

RSA

(

1.1.R.50

) does not credit a

PPLSC

or an underpaid amount (

1.1.U.05

) to an account of a person within 28 days of receiving the amount, the amount not credited is a debt due to the Commonwealth.

6.2.3.20 Withdrawing an infringement notice

Who may withdraw an infringement notice?

An employee who receives an infringement notice may write to Centrelink or the

requesting the notice be withdrawn.

Centrelink or the FWO may withdraw infringement notices, whether or not the person has made written representations seeking the withdrawal, but each may only withdraw a notice which they issued. They cannot withdraw notices issued by one another.

In deciding whether to withdraw an infringement notice Centrelink or the FWO MUST take into account any written representation from the employer seeking the withdrawal of the notice.

whether a court has previously imposed a penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision under the PPLAct

the circumstances of the alleged contravention

whether the person has paid a penalty for a previous contravention which is substantially the same as the current contravention

any other matter that is considered relevant.

Withdrawal of an infringement notice

Notice must be given to an employer where an infringement notice is withdrawn. The withdrawal notice must state:

the employer's name and address

the day the infringement notice was given

the identifying number of the infringement notice

that the infringement is withdrawn, and

that proceedings seeking a civil penalty order may be bought in relation to the alleged contravention.

Refund of penalty if infringement notice withdrawn

Where an infringement notice is withdrawn after the penalty has been paid, the Commonwealth is liable to refund the amount of the penalty.

5.2.2.30 Payability determination on special PPL claim for PLP

Introduction

If a special

PPL

claimant has made an effective special PPL claim for

PLP

for one or more flexible PPL days for a child, Centrelink must determine the claim under the PPLAct section 14.

In order to determine that the special PPL claimant is payable, Centrelink must be satisfied that:

a payability determination is in force that PLP for the child is payable to a PPL claimant, and

the special PPL claimant was or will be eligible for PLP on the days claimed.

In addition, if the special PPL claimant is the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances:

the PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances has given permission for the special PPL claimant to claim PLP for one or more flexible PPL days for the child

the permission has not been revoked, and

the number of flexible PPL days in the permission would not be exceeded if a payability determination was made.

Centrelink must determine that PLP is payable to the special PPL claimant for each of the days claimed on which the above criteria are satisfied.

Centrelink must determine that PLP is not payable to the special PPL claimant for each of the days claimed on which the above criteria are not satisfied.

Note:

There are some circumstances in which Centrelink is prevented from making a payability determination (

5.2.2.50

).

Note:

A person will not be eligible on a flexible PPL day if the maximum entitlement for the person or the child have been reached.

The payability determination for the special PPL claimant must specify the claimed days (if any) for which PLP is payable, and the claimed days (if any) for which PLP is not payable.

If the special PPL claimant is the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, Centrelink must make a determination that the special PPL claimant is conditionally eligible for PLP for other flexible PPL days for the child (

1.1.C.143

) if:

Centrelink determines that PLP is not payable to the special PPL claimant on all of the days claimed

the special PPL claimant has not previously satisfied the work test and income test in relation to the child, and

Centrelink is satisfied that the special PPL claimant satisfies the work test and income test on the day the determination is made.

4.3.8.60 Paying instalment of PLP on particular payday

Introduction

An employer or Centrelink is usually required to pay an instalment on a particular day.

The employer or Centrelink is taken to have complied with a requirement to pay an instalment on a particular day if the instalment is paid before that day (as might happen if the payday is a public holiday and the usual practice is to pay before the holiday) or, if payments cannot be made on the required day, as soon as practicable after that day.

Example:

The employer has incorrect bank account details for the employee (

1.1.E.40

) and therefore cannot make the payment at the required time, or where the employer or Centrelink is required to pay the person after the start of the person’s continuous flexible period.

2.6.3 PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances - gaining parent in a surrogacy arrangement

Introduction

A person who is the gaining parent of a child born because of a surrogacy arrangement (

1.1.S.100

) may be eligible for

PLP

as a

PPL

claimant (

1.1.P.170

) in exceptional circumstances.

Eligibility criteria

A person who is the gaining parent of a child born because of a surrogacy arrangement can be eligible for PLP, if they meet the core PPL claimant requirements (

2.1

) relating to:

the work test (

1.1.W.30

)

the income test (

ATI

(

1.1.A.40

)), and

Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

).

They must also:

be caring for the child, unless

the child was stillborn (

1.1.S.90

) or has died

they are temporarily unable to care for the child (

1.1.T.50

), or

they have lost care for the child (

1.1.L.30

), and

not perform more than one hour of paid work on the day, unless

the child was stillborn or has died

they have lost care of the child without their consent

they are a defence force member or law enforcement officer and they have been compulsorily recalled to duty

they are performing paid work because they have to comply with a summons or other compulsory process to give evidence or information, or produce documents or other things, or

they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker (

1.1.E.95

) and they returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances cannot be eligible for a flexible PPL day that exceeds their maximum PLP entitlement (

2.9

).

A person does not need permission to claim in order to make a PPL claim in exceptional circumstances.

A PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances may give permission to claim PLP to their partner as a special PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances.

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a NARWP applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

Exceptional circumstances criteria

In order for the gaining parent of a child born because of a surrogacy arrangement to make an effective claim as a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances, the following must apply:

the child is in the care of the person and has been, or is likely to be, in that care for a continuous period of at least 26 weeks

they became, or are likely to become, the child's primary carer before the child's first birthday, and

Centrelink is satisfied that it is in the interests of the child for the person to care for the child, taking into account

whether the person intends to be the long-term primary carer of the child

whether the birth mother has relinquished care of the child, and

any other relevant matter.

Matters to consider when working out whether the child was born because of a surrogacy arrangement include:

whether the child was born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement (however described) that meets the requirements of the law of a state or territory that applies in relation to the surrogacy arrangement, and

whether a court has made an order relating to who is a parent of the child.

4.1.6 Permission to make claims

Introduction

In some cases, a claim for

PLP

will only be effective if the claimant has permission from another person to make claims.

Permission (and revocation) must be given in the form approved by the Secretary and specify the person to whom the permission is given.

Permission from a birth mother

The following people require permission to make claims from the birth mother in order to make an effective

PPL

claim (

1.1.P.165

):

A parent (other than an adoptive parent) of the child who is not the child’s birth mother

The partner of the child’s birth mother

The partner of the parent who is not the birth mother

Note:

Birth mothers do not need permission to make a claim.

Permission from an adoptive parent

The partner of an adoptive parent, who is not one of the child's adoptive parents, cannot make an effective PPL claim unless permission to make a claim has been given by:

the first adoptive parent to have been found payable for PLP in relation to the child, or

if an adoptive parent has not been found payable for PLP in relation to the child, an adoptive parent nominated by the claimant to give permission.

Note:

Adoptive parents do not need permission to make a claim.

Permission from a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances

The partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances cannot make an effective special PPL claim (

1.1.S.55

) unless permission to claim has been given by the PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances.

Note:

PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances and special PPL claimants in exceptional circumstances do not need permission to make a claim.

Revocation of permission

If a person has given permission for another person to make claims for the child, the person may revoke the permission. Once revoked, the person will no longer be able to make claims for PLP.

Note:

Some claimants require permission to claim days in order to be payable (

5.2.2.20

Payability determination on a PPL claim for PLP,

5.2.2.30

Payability determination on special PPL claim for PLP).

4.3.5.10 Giving a record of PLP payment to a person

Introduction

The employer, before the end of the next working day (

1.1.W.50

) after paying an instalment to a person, is required to give the person a record of the

PLP

paid to the person.

The PPL Rules prescribe that the employer is to provide the following information:

the employer's name

the employer's

ABN

the name of the person (claimant) to whom the payment was made

the period to which the payment relates

the date on which the payment was made

if no other payments are made by the employer to the person for the period, a statement identifying the payment as PLP, specifying the gross amount and the net amount of the payment and the amount of income tax withheld from the payment

if other payments are made by the employer to the person for the period in addition to PLP, the gross amount of the

PPL

payment and a statement identifying it as PLP, the total net amount paid to the person for the period and the total amount of income tax withheld from the total gross payment, and

if a deduction authorised by the person or a deduction relating to child support is made from the gross amount, the amount of each deduction, the name of the entity to whom the amount deducted was paid and the bank account details into which the amount deducted was paid.

Employers must provide the information relating to instalments of PLP either on a payslip or a separate written advice. Employers may notify employees of the payment of their PLP instalment using their existing salary and wage and payslip systems, or by a separate notice. The information may be given either in electronic form or a hard copy.

1.1.P.220 PPL Rules

Definition

The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make PPL Rules. The PPL Rules provide for matters required or permitted by the PPLAct or necessary or convenient to be provided in order to carry out or give effect to the PPLAct.

Disallowable legislative instruments must be registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. Once registered, decisions may be made on the basis of the legislative instrument from its date of commencement.

Once registered, disallowable legislative instruments are tabled in each House of Parliament on a sitting day that occurs within 6 sitting days after the instrument has been registered. An instrument may be disallowed by either House in whole or part, at any time within 15 sitting days of the instrument being tabled in that House. The combined effect of the

Legislation Act 2003

section 13 and section 42, and the

Acts Interpretation Act 1901

subsection 7(2)(b), is that disallowance does not affect any decisions made pursuant to the instrument prior to a disallowance.

The PPL Rules are a disallowable legislative instrument.

The PPL Rules 2021 commenced on 1 April 2021.

The PPL Rules 2010 commenced on 25 December 2010 and sunset on 1 April 2021.

The PPL Rules (among other things):

specify exceptional circumstances in which a

PPL

or special PPL claim can be made and the eligibility criteria to be met by particular categories of claimants in exceptional circumstances

provide more detail about the defined concepts 'paid work' and 'paid leave'

set out the information that an employer and Centrelink must provide a

PLP

recipient after an instalment of PLP is paid, and the records to be kept by employers

may prescribe guidelines for the operation of the interest charge on debts

provide guidelines for giving public interest certificates, and

extend the PPLAct to persons who are not employees and employers.

4.2.2.10 When are employers required to provide PLP?

When an employer determination must be made

An employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) must be made for a person and their employer if the following conditions are met:

the person has a payability determination or an initial eligibility determination

the person will have been employed by the employer (or by the Commonwealth) for 12 months or more immediately prior to the child's expected or actual

DOB

or placement where adoption is involved (as relevant)

the person has a continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) and is likely to be an Australian-based employee of the employer for that period

instalments of

PLP

are likely to be payable by the employer to the person for at least 8 weeks (40 consecutive days that are weekdays), and

there are no flexible

PPL

days prior to the person’s continuous flexible period for which the person is payable or initially eligible.

The employer must also have an

ABN

. This requirement does not apply where the person's employment is as a law enforcement officer or defence force member.

An 'Australian-based employee' is an employee:

whose primary place of work is in Australia, or

who works in Australia or overseas for an Australian Government employer (Commonwealth, state and territory or local government).

Certain people who do not fall into the usual definition of employee, such as Defence Force personnel and some law enforcement officers, are regarded as employees for the purposes of PPL.

Note:

The only employees working overseas who can be paid by their employer are government employees.

Acceptance notice

If Centrelink makes an employer determination for a person and their employer, a notice must be given to the person and employer advising of this decision.

The employer must respond within 14 days after the date of the notice by either giving the Secretary an acceptance notice or applying for review of the employer determination.

An acceptance notice given by an employer must contain a declaration that the employer accepts their obligation to pay instalments of PLP to the person and contain bank account information and pay cycle information to enable Centrelink to pay PPL funding amounts to the employer at the appropriate times.

Centrelink provision of PPL funding amounts to employers

Centrelink pays an amount equivalent to the gross amount of PLP payable to the claimant to the claimant's employer, usually by providing PPL funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to the employer on a fortnightly basis, in advance of the employer's pay cycle for the employee. Employers can elect to receive the total required PPL funding amount for an employee in just 3 funding amounts.

Employer payment of PLP to employees

If an employer determination is in force for the person and their employer, and the employer has been funded to provide PLP to their employee, the employer is required to provide PLP to their employees in accordance with their employee's usual payroll cycle. Employers are not required to make superannuation payments in relation to PLP and employees do not accrue leave entitlements in respect of PLP.

Obligations of employers relating to provision of PLP

Payments of PLP are treated in a similar way to employment-related payments. Employers have certain obligations in relation to the PPL scheme including:

providing their bank account details and their employee's usual pay cycle details so that PPL funds can be transferred to their bank account before they are required to provide PLP to their employees

providing PLP to their employees for their employee's continuous flexible period and in accordance with their employee's normal pay cycle

withholding tax from PLP under the usual

PAYG

withholding arrangements

providing employees with written records of PLP paid to their employee - usually a payslip - within one working day after the pay has been transferred

including PLP in their employee's annual or part-year payment summary

keeping written financial records of PPL funds received from Centrelink and of PLP paid to their employee

returning any unpaid PPL funds to Centrelink

notifying Centrelink

if the employee performs more than one hour of paid work for the employer during the person's continuous flexible period

if and when an employee is no longer their employee, if this occurs before the end of the continuous flexible period

if the employer changes their bank account or their employee's pay cycle

if the employer receives an incorrect PPL funding amount from Centrelink or if they are unable to provide PLP to their employee, and

notifying Centrelink, in advance if possible, of ceasing to trade, including selling the business, transferring ownership or merging with another business.

Other employer obligations

An employer's obligation to pay an employee PLP is separate and additional to any other obligation the employer has in relation to the employee. For example, if the employer is obliged to provide paid leave to an employee through an industrial instrument such as a workplace agreement, or law, they will continue to have that obligation for the life of the agreement or law.

Pre-registration of employer details

Employers are able to register certain details with Centrelink, regardless of whether any claim has been made by an eligible employee. This allows employers to be prepared for their role in the scheme.

5.1 Employer determinations for PLP

Note:

From 1 October 2016, Centrelink must not make an employer determination for a person or their employer if the person is on an income support payment (

5.1.1

).

Introduction

This chapter is about employer determinations (

1.1.E.60

) relating to a claim for

PLP

. If an employer determination is in force for an employer and a person on a day during a

PPL

instalment period (

1.1.I.80

), the employer must pay an instalment of PLP to the person:

on the payday for the instalment if the instalment is payable to the person in relation to a flexible PPL day that falls within the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

), and

where the employer has been paid enough (

1.1.P.10

) to fund the instalment as at the payroll cut-off for the instalment.

An employer determination must not be made for any flexible PPL days that do not fall within the person's continuous flexible period. These will be paid directly by Services Australia.

The terms 'employer' and 'employee' are used in various provisions in the PPLAct and have their ordinary, or common law, meanings. In addition, the PPL Rules extend the PPLAct to persons who are not employees and employers, in relation to law enforcement officers and defence force members.

If Centrelink is satisfied that certain conditions are met (

5.1.1

), Centrelink must make an employer determination. Not all of these conditions need to be met where the employer elects to pay PLP to an employee and the employee agrees to this.

If Centrelink makes an employer determination for a person and the person's employer, the employer must either give Centrelink an acceptance notice (which contains information necessary to pay PPL funding amounts (

1.1.P.180

) to the employer) or apply for review of the decision to make an employer determination (

5.1.1

).

In this chapter

This chapter contains the following sections:

5.1.1 Making employer determinations for PLP

5.1.2 Notice of employer determinations for PLP

5.1.3 Employer response to notice of employer determination for PLP

5.1.4 Requirements for acceptance notice by employer of employer determination for PLP

2.5.1 Caring for a child for PLP - adoptive parents

Adoptive parents

In the case of an adoption, the claimant must establish that the adoption occurred or is underway, and that they are, or will be, the adoptive parent of a child.

For adoptive parents to be eligible for

PLP

, the child must become entrusted to the care of the person by an authorised party as part of the process of adoption, and the child must be under 16 years of age at the time of placement with the adoptive parents.

Either adoptive parent, or the partner of an adoptive parent (where relevant) may claim PLP as a

PPL

claimant and receive PLP for the days they are caring for the child.

Eligible adoptive relationships do not include known adoptions (

1.1.K.20

), including step-child adoptions. These are situations where the child has lived continuously with the prospective adoptive parent prior to the date on which the process of adoption commenced and the adoption is more in the nature of formalising the parental relationship. In these cases, it would normally be expected that the child would not be regarded as being placed with the adoptive parent as part of the process of adoption, and hence such an adoptive parent would not be eligible.

4.3.1.10 Instalment period & payday for PLP

Introduction

If an instalment (

1.1.I.80

) is to be paid by an employer and there is a regular period for which the person is usually paid in relation to their performance of work, then the person's instalment period is that regular period and the payday for the instalment is the day on which the person is usually paid.

A payday could be before, during or after the instalment period to which the instalment relates, depending on when and how (in advance or arrears or a mix of the 2) the employer would usually pay the person for their work.

If the person does not have a regular pay period, then the instalment period is each calendar month and the payday for the instalment is the first day after the end of the relevant calendar month.

If an instalment is to be paid by Centrelink, then the person's instalment period is the period of 14 days starting on the day Centrelink considers appropriate, and each successive 14-day period, and the payday is a day after the end of the instalment period considered appropriate by Centrelink.

2.4.2 Absences from Australia for PLP

Introduction

This topic explains how a temporary absence (

1.1.A.10

) from Australia affects eligibility for

PLP

.

When a person who has left Australia continues to meet residency conditions

A person who meets the residency conditions at

2.4.1

, and has left Australia and remains absent from Australia may continue to meet the Australian residency test for PLP, until they have been absent from Australia for a period of more than 56 weeks. A person no longer satisfies the Australian residency test on any day on which they have been absent from Australia for more than 56 weeks.

A person may be eligible for PLP on any flexible PPL days (

1.1.F.70

) for the child that fall within 56 weeks of the date they first became absent from Australia (unless they receive an extension from the Secretary). They will be ineligible on any flexible PPL days that fall after this date as long as they continue to be remain absent from Australia. Once they return to Australia they will satisfy the residency requirements again, and may be eligible for any remaining flexible PPL days.

Extension to the temporary absence period

The Secretary may extend the 56 week period to a period of no more than 3 years if a person was unable to return to Australia due to:

deployment outside Australia as a defence force member, under conditions specified in a determination made under the

Defence Act 1903

that relates to such deployment, or

deployment outside Australia for the purpose of capacity building or peacekeeping functions as a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police, or a protective service officer within the meaning of the

Australian Federal Police Act 1979

.

Calculating the absence period

If a person who has been absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks, but less than 56 weeks, returns to Australia, and then leaves again less than 6 weeks later, then the person is taken not to have returned to Australia for the purposes of calculating the 56 week period for the Australian residency test for PLP.

If a person has been absent from Australian for 56 or more weeks, then returns to Australia and leaves again less than 6 weeks after returning, they do not meet the Australian residency test and are not eligible for PLP at any time during their stay in Australia or their subsequent absence from Australia.

If the 56 weeks absence period expires during a return to Australia of less than 6 weeks, the Australian residency test will not be met for any days after the 56 weeks, including days falling within that period of return, despite the individual's physical presence in Australia.

1.1.N.10 National minimum wage order

Definition

'National minimum wage order' has the same meaning as in the

Fair Work Act 2009

.

Under the Fair Work Act, a national minimum wage order means a national minimum wage order made in an annual wage review. The Fair Work Act requires Fair Work Australia to conduct and complete an annual wage review in each financial year.

The national minimum wage order comes into operation as provided for under Fair Work Act section 287.

For the purposes of the PPLAct, the

NMW

is taken to be the wage set by the national minimum wage order for employees in relation to whom no exceptional circumstances exist.

To clarify, the

NMW

amount for a

PLP

day is the same for all people and is not affected by Fair Work Act section 294, which provides for special NMWs for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with disability.

Fair Work Act subsection 287(5) provides that the national minimum wage order comes into operation on 1 July, but does not take effect in relation to a particular employee until the employee's next payday. However, for PLP purposes, the national minimum wage order takes effect from 1 July. This means that the national minimum wage order in operation as at 1 July affects the rate of PLP on 1 July.

If a determination is made to vary a national minimum wage order and the determination comes into operation on a day that is earlier than the day the determination is made, the determination is taken to come into operation on the day the determination is made. Any such variation would therefore not affect the daily NMW amount retrospectively, regardless of the date of operation specified in the order.

1.2.2.10 Family assistance

Parental leave pay

A person will not be eligible for

NBS

for a child if

PLP

is payable to the person for that child. In the case of a multiple birth or adoption a person can receive PLP for one child and NBS for the second and subsequent children (where NBS eligibility criteria are met).

If a person is a member of a couple and PLP is payable to their partner for a child, the person will not be eligible for NBS for that child if their partner is payable for PLP for at least one day while they were a member of a couple.

A person will not be eligible for

SBP

for a child if PLP is payable to them or their partner for that child. In the case of a multiple birth a person can receive PLP for one child and SBP for the second and subsequent children (where NBS eligibility criteria is met).

Families that choose PLP will not be able to receive

FTB

Part B (

1.1.F.20

) for days they are receiving PLP. However, depending on income and other eligibility criteria, they may continue to receive FTB Part A.

PLP is taxable and counts as income for family assistance purposes.

New parents who are not eligible for PLP may receive, if eligible, NBS and FTB Part B in addition to FTB Part A.

Note:

People who receive PLP for a child born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025 will receive a

PPLSC

. The PPLSC is not considered taxable income or a reportable superannuation contribution for the purpose of family assistance payments and does not impact the amount of payments that are payable to a person and/or their partner.

8.2.4 Responsibilities of nominees

Responsibilities of nominees

When a nominee is appointed, the nominee is to act in the best interests of the principal, that is, the

PPL

or special PPL claimant.

If Centrelink gives a nominee a notice under PPLAct section 288, the nominee is required to advise of any matter that affects their ability to act as a nominee. If any allegations of misuse of the payment by the nominee are received, the nominee arrangement must be reviewed immediately.

Disclosure of information

Information in relation to the principal's

PLP

may be disclosed to their appointed nominee as if they are the recipient.

Payment nominees

The payment nominee should keep a record of the expenditure of the principal's payments in case the arrangement needs to be reviewed. Centrelink may send the nominee a notice requesting a statement to be made regarding their disbursement of money paid to the nominee on behalf of the principal. A nominee commits an offence if they refuse or fail to comply with a notice under PPLAct section 289. A financial penalty may apply.

Correspondence nominees

Where a principal is required to perform an act for the purposes of PPL law, this can be actioned by the correspondence nominee on behalf of the principal. This includes providing permission for a person to make claims and permission for a person to claim days. A correspondence nominee can provide permission for another person or themselves.

Any notice that is authorised or required under the PPLAct to be given to the claimant by Centrelink may be given to their correspondence nominee. The correspondence nominee may satisfy all requirements of notices on behalf of the principal.

Where a principal who has a correspondence nominee is required to attend Centrelink or a particular place under provisions of the PPLAct other than those of Part 6-2, the correspondence nominee may also be advised of the details regarding the requirement and the correspondence nominee may attend with the principal if the latter so wishes.

Nominees must notify matters affecting their ability to act as nominees

Centrelink may give the nominee of a principal a notice under PPLAct section 288 requiring the nominee to inform Centrelink if:

an event or change of circumstances happens, or

the nominee becomes aware that an event or change of circumstances is likely to happen and the event or change of circumstances is likely to affect

the ability of the nominee to act as the payment or correspondence nominee of the principal

the ability of Centrelink to give notices to the nominee of the Act, or

the ability of the nominee to comply with notices given to the nominee by Centrelink under the Act.

The notice must be in writing and be given personally or by post or by such other means determined by Centrelink. It must also specify how the nominee is to give information to Centrelink and the period within which to do so. Subsection 288(3) provides that the notice under subsection 288(1) is not ineffective just because it does not specify the latter requirement (how the nominee is to give the information to Centrelink), and subsection 288(4) provides that the period must not end earlier than 14 days after either the day on which the event or change of circumstances happens, or the day on which the nominee becomes aware that the event or change of circumstances is likely to happen. This does not apply to a requirement in a notice for a nominee to inform Centrelink of any proposal by the nominee to leave Australia.

The above requirements extend extraterritorially and to all people, regardless of their nationality or citizenship.

1.4.5 Act of grace payments

What is an act of grace payment?

An act of grace payment is a special 'gift of money' by the Commonwealth. They are payments that fall outside statutory entitlements.

Generally, act of grace payments are a means of providing compensation to persons who may have been unfairly disadvantaged by the Commonwealth but who have no legal claim against it. Other avenues to receive financial assistance from the Australian Government should be investigated before a request is made for an act of grace payment.

When is an act of grace payment made?

An act of grace payment may be appropriate in relation to special circumstances that have occurred as a direct result of:

the involvement of an agency of the Australian Government, where that involvement had an unintended outcome in the applicant's circumstance, or

the application of Commonwealth legislation or policy, which has resulted in an unintended, inequitable or anomalous effect on the applicant's particular circumstances (including in cases where the agency has acted correctly in administering the legislation involved), and

where the paramount obligation to the applicant is moral, rather than legal.

How to apply for an act of grace payment

Claims are made in writing and application forms are available from the Department of Finance website.

When can an act of grace payment NOT be made?

An act of grace payment cannot be made if:

the case relates to defective administration, or

the matter can be justly or legally considered under any enactment.

Example:

Any case that can be settled under

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

cannot be paid as an act of grace payment.

For further explanation of this topic, refer to

Requests for discretionary financial assistance under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (RMG 401)

2.2.3 Hazardous jobs for PLP

The work test period for people in hazardous jobs

Where a person does not meet the work test because they ceased working in a hazardous job (for example, jockeys, boxers or miners), the work test period will be the 392 days prior to the day the person is no longer performing work in the hazardous job.

From 1 January 2020, for the purposes of determining the eligibility of a claimant or making an initial eligibility determination, the work test period for a person will be the 392 days immediately before the day they ceased work if:

the person would not satisfy the usual work test

the person is pregnant or is the birth mother of the child

the person is performing or performed paid work of a particular kind before the child is born

the person will cease or ceased performing that kind of work on a particular day because of hazards connected with that kind of work that pose or posed a risk to the pregnancy, and

any conditions prescribed by the

PPL

Rules are satisfied.

The person must satisfy the work test requirements (

2.2.1

) during this period in order to meet the work test.

Evidence to support a claim under the dangerous jobs provision

A person may be asked to provide evidence to Centrelink that shows:

Before their child was born they worked in a particular job. This can include

a letter from their employer

a copy of their contract/workplace agreement, or

a statutory declaration of their job description (for self-employed people).

AND

They stopped working because of hazards connected with the work which posed a risk to their pregnancy. This can include

a medical certificate

a letter from their employer, or

a copy of their Industry regulations or guidelines that confirm that they are unable to continue working due to the hazardous nature of their job.

Example:

Sarah was employed as a jockey and was required to train and race horses.

On 3 March 2020, Sarah found out she was in the early stages of her pregnancy and she told her employer. As part of her industry agreement, Sarah was advised that she would have to cease work immediately due to the high risk of falling from the horse and the additional risk of abdominal trauma and placental abruption.

Sarah stopped work early due to a work place hazard to her pregnancy as a jockey. Sarah provided proof from her employer confirming that she was employed as a jockey and also a copy of the industry regulations to support her claim.

As Sarah met the dangerous job provision, her work test period can be moved to the 13-month period prior to the date she stopped work due to the hazard, 3 February 2019 to 3 March 2020. If Sarah meets the work test in her new work test period, she will meet the initial eligibility for

PLP

.

Example:

Amy was employed as a miner. She was required to work underground with exposure to chemicals and physically demanding tasks.

On 10 June 2020, Amy found out she was 8 weeks pregnant and advised her employer. Amy's workplace agreement states that she had to stop work immediately due to the hazardous nature of her job and the risk to her unborn child.

Amy started a new job with the local bakery 1 October 2020. Amy's last day with the bakery was the 31 December 2020 before her baby's due date of 20 January 2021. Amy lodged a pre-birth claim for PPL, her work test period is from 25 December 2019 to 20 January 2021. Amy will not meet the work test due to her having more than a consecutive 12-week gap between 2 work days in her work test period.

Amy can still meet the PPL work test under the dangerous job provision if she can provide evidence from the mining company and her doctor to support her claim.

Amy provides proof from her employer that she was employed as an underground miner and a copy of her workplace agreement. She also provided a letter from her doctor to support her claim confirming the danger to her unborn child had she continued working in that field.

Amy met the dangerous job provision and her work test period was moved to the 13-month period prior to the date she stopped work as a miner, 15 May 2019 to the 10 June 2020. Amy still needs to meet the work test in her new work test period.

an instalment is payable to the person

an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) is in force on a day during the instalment period to which the instalment relates, and

the employer has been paid enough to fund the instalment as at the payroll cut-off day.

If an employer is required to pay an instalment to a person the requirement only applies to a flexible

PPL

day that falls within the continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) mentioned in the employer notice relating to the employer determination.

Note:

Centrelink must pay an instalment to the person in relation to a day that is a payable flexible PPL day that does not fall within the person's continuous flexible period (

4.3.6.15

).

Note:

Centrelink must pay an instalment if the person's continuous flexible period is extended on review after that period has ended (

4.3.7.30

).

Employer determination comes into force after the instalment period

An employer may become required to pay an instalment after the start of a person's continuous flexible period. In this situation, where neither Centrelink nor the employer was required to pay an earlier instalment but would have been if one or more instalments were payable from the start of the person's continuous flexible period, the instalments are taken to have become payable. Provided the employer has been paid enough (

1.1.P.10

) to fund the earlier instalments, the employer must also pay them with the next instalment.

Employer determination in force & employer paid enough at a later time

If the employer has not been paid enough to fund an instalment at the payroll cut-off for the instalment and this is rectified at the payroll cut-off for a later instalment, then the employer must pay the instalment to the person on the payday for the later instalment period.

The payroll cut-off is the last day in the employee's pay cycle that the employer can reasonably make changes to the instalment to be paid to, or in relation to, the person on the person's payday for the instalment.

An employer is taken to have complied with a requirement to pay an instalment on a payday if the instalment is paid before the payday or, if the employer cannot pay on the day, as soon as practicable after that day.

A failure by the employer to pay instalments as required may result in a financial penalty.

An employer is not required to pay an instalment to a person except in accordance with the above.

4.3.8.70 Effect of garnishee order on instalment of PLP

Introduction

An instalment (

1.1.I.80

) is absolutely inalienable until the instalment of

PLP

has been paid into a bank account. At that point, the payment loses its character as an instalment and consequently its inalienability.

However, instalment amounts that have been paid into an account are protected, under some circumstances, from a garnishee order made by a court. Garnishee orders do not apply to a saved amount (

1.1.S.10

). The saved amount is worked out as follows:

Step 1 - work out the total amount of the instalments that have been paid to the credit of the account during the 4-week period immediately before the court order came into force.

Step 2 - subtract from the Step 1 amount the total amount withdrawn from the account during the same 4-week period.

The result is the saved amount.

2.6 Who is a PPL claimant for PLP?

Introduction

A

PPL

claimant (

1.1.P.170

) for

PLP

can be the birth mother of the child, the parent of the child that is not the birth mother, an adoptive parent or a partner of a parent of the child. A PPL claim may also be made in exceptional circumstances, as prescribed by the PPL Rules.

PPL claimants for PLP must meet eligibility criteria relating to the work test (

1.1.W.30

) and the income test (

1.1.I.20

).

In addition, to be eligible on a flexible PPL day a PPL claimant must:

meet the Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

) on the day and on the

DOB

of the child

be caring for the child (

2.5

) on the day, unless

their child is stillborn or has died

they are temporarily unable to care for their child (

1.1.T.50

), or

they have lost care of their child without their consent (

1.1.L.30

), and

not be performing more than one hour of paid work on the day, unless

their child was stillborn or has died

they have lost care of their child without their consent

they are a defence force member or law enforcement officer and they have been compulsorily recalled to duty (

1.1.R.05

)

they are complying with the requirements of a summons or other compulsory process to appear

they are a health professional, emergency services worker or other essential worker (

1.1.E.95

) and they have returned to work in response to a state, territory or national emergency, or

the child is required to remain in hospital or is immediately hospitalised after birth.

A PPL claimant cannot be eligible for a flexible PPL day that exceeds their maximum PLP entitlement (

2.9

).

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

Note:

The following people cannot make an effective PPL claim for PLP unless they have permission to make claims (

4.1.6

):

a parent of a child who is not the birth mother

the partner of a parent of the child who is not the birth mother

the partner of the birth mother, or

the partner of an adoptive parent.

Note:

The following people can only receive PLP for the number of days they have permission to receive (

5.2.2.40

):

a parent of a child who is not the birth mother

the partner of a parent who is not the birth mother

the partner of the birth mother

a subsequent claimant adoptive parent, or

the partner of an adoptive parent.

Birth mother PPL claimants – exceptions & additions to the core requirements

A birth mother who relinquishes their child in a surrogacy or adoption arrangement, or a birth mother whose child was removed from their care by a state or territory child protection agency or in accordance with a decision of a court of a state or territory, may be an eligible PPL claimant for PLP if they meet the core PPL claimant requirements above, with the exception of the requirement to be caring for the child (

2.5

).

Note:

A birth mother who would have relinquished care of their child if not for the stillbirth or death of the child, is still eligible for PLP on a day if they have performed more than one hour of paid work on that day.

For birth mothers who meet these conditions, PLP will only be payable on a day within:

20 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2023

22 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2024

24 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2025

8.1.3 Child stillborn or dies

Introduction

If a claim is made for

PLP

for a child, and, before or after the claim is made, the child is stillborn or dies, then a reference in the PPLAct (other than section 31AA and section 47) to a claimant caring for a child is taken to be a reference to a person who would have been caring for the child, had the child not been stillborn or died (section 277).

This means that a claim, including:

a claim where the birth mother would have, or has, relinquished the child, or

a claim made in exceptional circumstances under the PPL Rules

can be made by a claimant for a child who was stillborn or who has died, and the claimant can correctly establish eligibility.

Claimant eligibility - not exceptional circumstances

If the claim is made in ordinary circumstances, the claimant is eligible for PLP on a flexible

PPL

day in respect of a deceased or stillborn child on a day if on that day they meet all eligibility requirements, disregarding the requirement that they be caring for the child, and that they are to perform no more than one hour of paid work on a day. They must establish that they would have been caring for the child on that day had the child not been stillborn or died (PPLAct subsection 31AA(3)).

Claimant eligibility - exceptional circumstances

Where the claim is made in exceptional circumstances, the claimant must meet the eligibility requirements established by the PPLAct and PPL Rules for the type of claim.

Any reference to the claimant providing primary care under the PPL Rules should also be taken to be a reference to a person who would have been the child's primary carer in the exceptional circumstances, if the child had not been stillborn or died.

Birth mother eligibility - child to be relinquished but is stillborn or dies

The PPL Rules provide that where a child is stillborn or has died and, had the child not been stillborn or died, the birth mother would have relinquished her child:

for adoption

because of a surrogacy arrangement (

1.1.S.100

), or

because the child was removed from the person's care in accordance with a decision by a State or Territory court or child protection agency

the birth mother may be eligible for PLP on a flexible PPL day, subject to meeting the eligibility conditions other than those relating to caring for the child and performing no more than one hour of paid work.

The birth mother can only be eligible on a day within:

20 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2023

22 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2024

24 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2025

26 weeks of the day the child was born, for children born on or after 1 July 2026.

7.2.4 Other evidence provisions

Taking evidence

The

ART

may take evidence on oath or affirmation for the purposes of a review of a decision.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 75 Tribunal may take evidence

Powers to obtain information

The ART has several mechanisms through which it can obtain information relevant to an ART review:

The ART can, through a directions order, require a party to proceedings (this may include Centrelink even where it has elected not to participate) to give information or documents to the ART or another party to the proceeding, for the purposes of the proceeding.

The ART can, where it reasonably believes that a person has information that is relevant to an ART review and the person is not a party to the review (Centrelink would generally be considered a party in reviews of

PPL

decisions), by written notice given to the person, require the person to give to the ART, within the period and in the manner specified in the notice, any such information.

If the ART has reasonable grounds to believe a person (including a Centrelink officer) has information, or a document or item relevant to an ART review then the ART has the power to issue a summons requiring that person to appear before the ART and/or produce the document or item. The summons will be in writing and set a day, time and place for the person to appear and/or produce the document or item. This date, except with the consent of the person summoned, be at least 14 days after the summons is given to the person. If a person has been issued a summons to produce a document or item it can do so before the day specified in the summons.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 230 ART’s power to obtain information for ART review

ARTAct

section 74 Tribunal may summon person to give evidence or produce documents, section 79 Tribunal may give directions in relation to procedure for proceeding

Exercise by Centrelink of information-gathering powers

The ART may request Centrelink exercise the Secretary’s powers under PPL Act section 117 (

6.1.1

), if the ART reasonably believes that a person will be able to give information, or produce a document, that is relevant to the review of a decision. Centrelink must comply as soon as practicable, and, in any event, within 7 days after the request is made.

Note:

Generally, Centrelink can only use the Secretary’s powers to require a person to give information or produce a document where they have a reasonable belief the person will be able to do so. However, where the ART has requested Centrelink exercise the Secretary’s powers, only the ART and not Centrelink needs a reasonable belief to do so.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 116A Reasonable belief needed to require information or documents, section 117 General power to obtain information, section 231 ART may require Secretary to obtain information for ART review

Offence

It is an offence if:

a person fails to comply with a summons the ART has issued unless it was not reasonably practicable to do so, or

a person, who is not a party to the ART review, fails to comply with a notice issued by the ART, requiring the person to give information, expect where complying might incriminate the person.

In both cases, the penalty is imprisonment for 6 months or 30 penalty units, or both.

4.1.5 TFN statement for PLP claim

Introduction

The claim for

PLP

must contain a

TFN

statement. To satisfy this requirement the claimant must provide one of the following statements:

if the claimant has a TFN and knows what it is, the TFN must be included in the claim, or

if the claimant has a TFN but does not know what it is, the claim must include a statement that the claimant has a TFN but does not know what it is and the claimant has asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform the claimant of the TFN, and authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the claimant's TFN to Centrelink, or

if the claimant does not have a TFN at the time of the claim, the claim must include a statement that the person has applied for a TFN, and authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to

provide the TFN to Centrelink, or

advise Centrelink if the application for a TFN is refused, or

advise Centrelink if the application for a TFN has been withdrawn by the claimant, or

if the claimant has previously provided Centrelink with a TFN in an earlier claim for PLP, the claim must include a statement that the claimant has previously provided a TFN.

TFN information is required to allow the remission of tax withholdings to the Commissioner of Taxation for claimants not paid PLP by their employer.

Note:

Declining to provide a TFN statement is not an offence, but a claimant may not be paid PLP if they decide not to provide this information.

2.4.1 Australian residency test for PLP

Australian residency test

PPLAct section 45 prescribes the circumstances in which a person satisfies the Australian residency test for

PLP

purposes.

The Australian residency test for PLP is similar to that under family assistance law. In order to be eligible for PLP, the claimant must meet the Australian residency test (

1.1.A.110

). This means a

PPL

claimant or special PPL claimant must be:

an Australian resident (as defined in SSAct section 7(2)), that is, a person who resides in Australia (see SS Guide

3.1.1.10

for more information on determining whether a person is residing in Australia) and is

an Australian citizen

the holder of a permanent visa, or

an

SCV

holder (as defined in the

Migration Act 1958

section 32) who is a protected SCV holder

an SCV holder who is residing in Australia, or

the holder of a visa determined by the Minister for the purposes of SSAct subparagraph 729(2)(f)(v) and either the person is in Australia or is temporarily absent (

1.1.A.10

) from Australia for not more than 6 weeks, and the absence is an allowable absence in relation to special benefit (SpB).

A person who is the holder of a temporary visa made under SSAct section 729(2)(f)(v) may be eligible for PLP for up to 6 weeks of any temporary absence, but only if the absence is for one of the following reasons:

to attend an acute family crisis, for example, to visit a family member who is critically ill

for humanitarian reasons, for example, to adopt a child or attend custody proceedings, or

to receive eligible medical treatment that is not available in Australia.

If a PLP recipient who is the holder of a temporary visa made under SSAct section 729(2)(f)(v) departs Australia for a reason not listed above, they will be ineligible for PLP for the duration of their absence.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Part 2-3 Division 5 The Australian residency test, section 45 When a person satisfies the Australian residency test

SSAct

section 7(2) An Australian resident is a person who …, section 729(2) The Secretary may, in his or her discretion, determine that a SpB …

Residency & PLP

For pre-birth claims, the claimant must meet the Australian residency test on the day of the determination in order for an initial eligibility determination to be made.

To be eligible on a flexible PPL day, all claimants (except claimants in exceptional circumstances and their partners) must meet the above residency test on that day and on the

DOB

of the child.

Claimants in exceptional circumstances (and their partners where relevant) must meet the residency test on the flexible PPL day and on the day the claimant in exceptional circumstances became primary carer of the child.

Note:

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to PLP. There are a range of exemptions from the effect of the NARWP for PLP and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.4.3

).

8.3.2 Decisions

Decisions to be in writing

PPLSC decisions & reviews

Use of computer programs to make decisions

Centrelink may arrange for use of computer programs to make decisions. Where a decision under the PPLAct is generated by a computer program, it is deemed to be a decision by Centrelink and may be subject to review (if decisions by Centrelink of that nature are otherwise reviewable).

Notice of decisions

A notice of a decision under the PPLAct is to be taken to have been given to the person if the written notice of the decision is:

delivered to the person personally

left at the address of the place of residence or business of the person last known to Centrelink, or

sent by prepaid post to the postal address of the person last known to Centrelink.

Notices of decisions can also be given electronically in accordance with the

Electronic Transactions Act 1999

.

A notice of a decision under the PPLAct may be given to a person by properly addressing, prepaying and posting the document as a letter. If this procedure is followed, then the notice is taken to have been given to the person at the time at which the notice would be delivered in the ordinary course of post unless the contrary is proved.

If a provision of the PPLAct requires a notice of a decision to be given, the decision is not ineffective just because the notice was not given or was given late or did not comply with the requirements in relation to that decision of the PPLAct. Other notices (such as a notice requiring a person to provide information) are subject to the rules in section 28A and section 29 of the

Acts Interpretation Act 1901

.

1.2.2.40 Other matters impacted by PLP

Income maintenance period

In applying the income maintenance period, which affects

DSP

, youth allowance, austudy payment, jobseeker payment and parenting payment,

PLP

is not considered to be a 'leave payment'. However, for the purposes of the severe financial hardship provisions applying to the income maintenance period, PLP is included in consideration of a person's or a couple's liquid assets.

Income management

PLP is not subject to income management.

Child support deductions from PLP

Child Support (CS) has the ability to intercept PLP and deduct child support liabilities and debts from PLP whether paid by an employer or by Services Australia. The deduction rules for employer paid and Services Australia PLP are the same except where CS is seeking deductions in respect of child support debt alone from an employer. In all cases apart from this, the Protected Earnings Amount (PEA) must be left after tax and child support are deducted, that is, if the person is receiving less parental leave pay than PEA, then no child support can be withheld from the payment. Where deductions are sought by CS from an employer in respect of child support debt alone, CS's policies as to the amount of deduction will apply.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 69 Deductions relating to child support

Deductions authorised by a person

An employer or Services Australia may make a deduction from PLP if the person authorises the deduction, and if the deduction is principally for the person's benefit.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 67 Deductions authorised by person

Recovery of PLP debts

PLP debts can be recovered from the debtor's social security payments or from a third party's social security payments, with their consent, and from Veterans' income support payments, with consent. These debts can also be recovered by deductions from the debtor's instalments of

FTB

or from their entitlement to family assistance or from a third party's instalment of FTB or entitlement to family assistance with their consent. However, the restrictions relating to recovery for PLP debts from

CCS

entitlements and payments will remain.

4.3.6.20 Employer determination for PLP reviewed

Introduction

Where the employer has applied for review of the Centrelink decision to make an employer determination for the person and the employer and the employer determination has not come into force before the 28th day after the start of the person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

), Centrelink is required to pay the instalment of

PLP

that relates to an instalment period that:

either includes the 28th day after the start of the person's continuous flexible period, or is a later instalment period, and

starts before the day (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)) on which the employer determination comes into force (if at all).

Following a review, the employer determination for the person and their employer may or may not come into force. If the employer determination does not come into force, Centrelink will continue to pay the remaining instalments of PLP that are payable to the person.

If the employer determination comes into force, the day it comes into force is the transfer day. The employer may become responsible for paying instalments that relate to the period from the transfer day. In practice, Centrelink is likely to continue to pay the PLP instalments to ensure there are no further delays in payments to the person.

In addition to the obligation to provide instalments of PLP from the instalment period that includes the 28th day after the start of the continuous flexible period start date, Centrelink has an obligation to provide arrears owed to the person for instalments that are payable from the start of the continuous flexible period (

4.3.7.10

).

4.3.8.10 Required to pay instalment of PLP after start of continuous flexible period

Introduction

Centrelink or an employer (the payer) may become required to pay an instalment after the start of a person's continuous flexible period (

1.1.C.145

) where one or more instalment periods would have been payable to the person by the payer from the start of the person's continuous flexible period if the payer had been required to pay instalments from the start of the continuous flexible period.

This situation could occur, for example, where a person claims

PLP

and verifies the birth of their child (

1.1.V.10

) on day 28 after the birth, and a week later Centrelink makes a payability determination and the person's continuous flexible period starts from the

DOB

. In these circumstances, the earlier instalments that would have been payable, are taken to have become payable on the respective paydays for the instalments, and Centrelink or the employer must pay the instalments as soon as practicable after the pay day.

Example:

Andrew lodges a pre-birth claim for PLP in December for 90 flexible PPL days to be taken in a continuous block of consecutive weekdays from the DOB. Andrew is found initially eligible for the days claimed and an employer determination is made in relation to his continuous flexible period. Danielle is born on 1 February, and proof of birth is provided to Centrelink on 28 February. Centrelink processes the proof of birth and determines on 7 March that Andrew is payable for the flexible

PPL

days claimed. Andrew's continuous flexible period commences on 1 February and his first pay day includes instalments from the start of their continuous flexible period.

4.3.6.30 Employer determination for PLP revoked

Introduction

Where Centrelink revokes an employer determination for one of the reasons specified in PPLAct section 108, Centrelink must pay the instalments of

PLP

from the

PPL

instalment period in relation to a child of the person that begins on or after the day the revocation comes into force (the transfer day (

1.1.T.90

)).

Centrelink must also pay arrears for earlier PPL instalment periods in relation to a child of the person in circumstances where an employer determination is revoked either before or after coming into force.

4.3.5.20 Keeping records of PPL funding amounts received & PLP paid

Introduction

Employers are required to make, and keep for 7 years, records of a kind prescribed by the PPL Rules in relation to each person for whom an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) for the employer comes into force, relating to:

the

PPL

funding amounts received for the person, and

the instalments paid to the person.

The PPL Rules prescribe information to be included in those records as:

the name of the person (claimant) to whom the PPL payment is made

the PPL funding amounts received by the employer for the person and the flexible PPL days for which the funding amounts were paid to the person

the date each PPL payment was paid to the person and the period to which it relates, and the gross amount of each

PLP

payment paid to the person and a statement identifying the payment as PLP

if no other payments were made by the employer to the person on that day for the period, the net amount of the payment and the amount of income tax withheld from the payment

if other payments were made by the employer to the person on that day for the period, the total net amount paid to the person for the period and the total amount of income tax withheld from the total gross amount, and

the total amount deducted from each PPL payment to the person that relate to deductions authorised by the person and deductions relating to child support.

A record kept for the purposes described above must be in a legible form and in the English language, it must be accessible to a person exercising compliance powers in accordance with the PPLAct.

To satisfy the requirements in relation to PPL funding amounts, employers may keep records of the payment advices they receive from Centrelink with each payment of PPL funding amounts that are transferred from Centrelink to the employer's bank account.

In most cases, employers will satisfy the requirements in relation to PLP paid to employees by using existing salary and wage record keeping processes (for example, payroll records) to keep records of PLP instalments paid to, or in relation to, each person.

Employer records must be sufficiently comprehensive and connected with the relevant employee so that the records indicate whether PPL funding amounts received in relation to a person reconcile with instalments of PLP and tax and any other deductions made from payments of instalments of PLP to the person.

A failure by an employer to comply with these requirements may result in a financial penalty.

6.3.4.20 Debt recovery by garnishee notice

Introduction

A debt may be recovered by means of a garnishee notice. A garnishee notice may be issued to any person, third party, or organisation.

From 1 January 2017, actions to recover a

PLP

, family assistance or other social security debt, can be commenced at any time.

Who can a garnishee notice be issued to?

A written garnishee notice (

1.1.G.10

) must be issued to any person:

by whom any money is due or accruing, or may become due, to the original debtor

who holds, or may subsequently hold, money for or on behalf of the original debtor

who holds, or may subsequently hold, money on account of some other person for payment to the debtor, or

who has authority from some other person to pay money to the original debtor.

Example:

A garnishee notice can be issued to a person's employer, bank or solicitor.

Centrelink must give a copy of the garnishee notice to the original debtor. This notice may be written or it may be electronically transmitted.

Amount covered by a garnishee notice

The amount covered by a garnishee notice is:

the amount to be recovered, not exceeding the amount of the original debt or the amount the garnishee owes or holds in relation to the debtor

the amount of each payment that the garnishee becomes liable to make to the original debtor, until the original debt is satisfied, or

the percentage of each payment that the garnishee becomes liable to make to the original debtor, until the original debt is satisfied.

Explanation:

The amount that can be recovered relates to the amount the person owes or will owe or hold for the original debtor.

When the payment must be made

The date by which payment must be made is specified in the notice. This date cannot be before either:

the money becomes due or is held by the garnishee debtor, or

the end of the period of 14 days after the notice is given.

Compliance with a garnishee notice

A person cannot refuse or fail to comply with a garnishee notice to the extent to which they are capable of complying with the notice. The penalty for non-compliance is 12 months imprisonment.

The amount of the debt outstanding is:

as much of the amount required by the garnishee notice as the garnishee was able to pay

as much of the debt due by the original debtor when the notice was given as remains due from time to time.

If a garnishee fails to comply with the garnishee notice, the amount of the debt outstanding is a debt due to the Commonwealth by the garnishee. The debt may be recovered by legal proceedings, or a further garnishee notice and the person may have to pay penalty interest.

If an amount is recovered from either the garnishee debtor or the original debtor, the amount reduces the balance of both debts. The amount of the unpaid debt stated in the garnishee notice is taken to be reduced by the amount so recovered.

These garnishee provisions apply to an amount regardless of any law of a state or territory under which the amount may be inalienable. If money is to be paid to the debtor only if a condition is met, then the money is taken to be due on demand even if the condition is not met.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 184 Garnishee notices—general, section 185 Garnishee notices—amounts paid in compliance, section 186 Garnishee notices—debt for failure to comply with notice, section 187 Garnishee notices—offence for non-compliance, section 188 Garnishee notices—relationship with other laws

Garnishee of joint bank accounts

A garnishee notice cannot be issued against a joint bank account because it is not possible to identify any portion as belonging solely to one owner.

8.1.5 Persons who are not employees or employers

Introduction

This section explains how the PPLAct applies to people in a relationship similar to that between an employer and employee.

Under Part 11 of the PPL Rules, Centrelink may make an employer determination (

1.1.E.60

) under the PPLAct Part 3-5 for people who are in a similar relationship to that between an employer and employee. This is to allow for employer determinations for those in relationships that do not fall squarely into the employer/employee model, such as defence force members and law enforcement officers.

The PPL Rules provide that Centrelink may make an employer determination for the Commissioner of Police (

1.1.C.120

) of a state or territory (other than Queensland or the Australian Capital Territory) and a person who is a law enforcement officer (

1.1.L.10

) of that state or territory.

The PPL Rules also provide that Centrelink may make an employer determination between the Crown in right of Queensland and a law enforcement officer of Queensland and between the AFP Commissioner (

1.1.A.65

) and a person who is an AFP officer (

1.1.A.67

). Similarly, the PPLAct is extended to defence force members under the PPL Rules to provide that Centrelink may make an employer determination for the Chief of the Defence Force (

1.1.C.60

) and a person who is a defence force member (

1.1.D.70

). In this situation, the PPL Rules modify the PPLAct so that the Chief of the Defence Force is taken to be the employer of the defence force member and vice-versa; a reference to the employment or engagement of a defence force member is taken to be a reference to the service of a member of the defence force; and a reference to the

FWO

or the Fair Work Inspector is taken to be a reference to the Defence Force Ombudsman.

5.2.2.20 Payability determination on a PPL claim for PLP

Introduction

If a

PPL

claimant has made an effective PPL claim for

PLP

for one or more flexible PPL days for a child, Centrelink must determine the claim under the PPLAct section 13.

In order for Centrelink to make a determination that the PPL claim is payable, Centrelink must be satisfied that the PPL claimant was or will be eligible on the days claimed. This includes a determination of whether they meet the work test and have permission to claim the days.

Work test

If the PPL claimant is:

a parent (other than an adoptive parent) of the child, and is not the child’s birth mother

the partner of the child’s birth mother

the partner of a person who is a parent (other than an adoptive parent) of the child, and is not the child’s birth mother

Centrelink must be satisfied that the birth mother of the child satisfies the work test on the day the determination is made.

If the PPL claimant is the partner of an adoptive parent of the child, the Secretary is satisfied that the adoptive parent who gave the PPL claimant permission to claim days satisfies the work test on the day the determination is made.

Permission to claim days

In order to assess whether PLP is payable to the PPL claimant on a day, where they are:

a parent (other than an adoptive parent) who is not the child’s birth mother

the partner of the child’s birth mother, or

the partner of a person who is a parent (other than an adoptive parent) of the child and is not the child’s birth mother

Centrelink must determine:

the birth mother has given permission for the PPL claimant to claim PLP for one or more flexible PPL days for the child

the permission has not been revoked, and

the number of flexible PPL days in the permission would not be exceeded if a payability determination was made.

In circumstances where the PPL claimant is a subsequent claimant adoptive parent of the child, or the partner of an adoptive parent of the child, Centrelink must determine that PLP is payable to the PPL claimant for each of the days claimed on which all the below criteria are satisfied:

The PPL claimant has permission to claim PLP for one or more flexible PPL days for the child. Permission can be given from either the first adoptive parent of the child to have been found payable for PLP or, if no adoptive parent has been found payable for PLP for the child, an adoptive parent nominated by the claimant.

The permission has not been revoked.

The number of flexible days in the permission would not be exceeded if a payability determination was made.

Centrelink must determine that PLP is not payable to the PPL claimant for each of the days claimed on which the above criteria are not satisfied.

Note:

There are some circumstances in which Centrelink is prevented from making a payability determination (

5.2.2.50

).

Note:

A person will not be eligible on a flexible PPL day if the maximum entitlement for the person or the child have been reached.

The payability determination for the PPL claimant must specify the claimed days (if any) for which PLP is payable, and the claimed days (if any) for which PLP is not payable.

Centrelink must make a determination that the PPL claimant is conditionally eligible for PLP for other flexible PPL days for the child (

1.1.C.143

) if:

Centrelink determines that PLP is not payable to the PPL claimant on all of the days claimed

the PPL claimant has not previously satisfied the work test and income test in relation to the child, and

Centrelink is satisfied that the PPL claimant satisfies the work test and income test on the day the determination is made.

6.2.3.40 Relationship between infringement notice & civil proceedings

Relationship between infringement notice & civil proceedings

The

Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014

section 108 makes clear that an infringement notice is not required to be given in relation to an alleged civil penalty.

A person still remains liable to have proceedings brought by Centrelink or the

FWO

for a civil penalty order if:

the person does not comply with an infringement notice relating to the contravention, or

an infringement notice is not given to the person, or

an infringement notice is given to the person and later withdrawn.

The Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act Part 5 Division 2, Infringement notices, does not limit the court's discretion to determine the amount of a pecuniary penalty that it could order a person to pay for a contravention of a provision subject to an infringement notice.

2.2.5 Premature birth & pregnancy-related complications or illness for PLP

Work test requirements

If the child was born prematurely (

1.1.B.30

), the birth mother, other parent of the child or partner of the birth mother may still meet the work test requirements, if Centrelink is satisfied that the person would have met the work test but for the premature birth of the child.

If the birth mother suffered complications or illness related to the pregnancy which prevented her from working, she may still meet the work test requirements if Centrelink is satisfied that she would have met the work test but for the pregnancy-related complications or illness which prevented her from performing paid work.

Example:

After a 3-year period out of the workforce caring for her first child, Elyse commenced working full-time in the public service on 1 November 2018. Several months later, Elyse's pregnancy was confirmed with 15 October 2019 established as the expected

DOB

of her baby. Because of high blood pressure, (pregnancy induced hypertension), she was required to undertake a period of complete bed rest to help prevent pre-term birth, so Elyse commenced unpaid leave from her job on 19 August 2019. Her baby was born prematurely on 20 September 2019. Centrelink is satisfied that Elyse would have met the work test requirement (that is, working for at least 330 hours in the 295 days in the 392 days before the birth with no more than 84 days between consecutive working days) but for pregnancy related complications, and she is eligible for

PLP

.

Example:

Nina had a history of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy. When Nina believed that she was again pregnant, on medical advice she elected to take a period of leave without pay from her full-time job of 6 years to minimise the possibility of another miscarriage. She returned to work full-time after 99 days of leave without pay and so did not meet the usual work test requirement of having a qualifying period of 295 consecutive days. On producing medical certification of her circumstances and confirming that she would have been at work during the period of leave without pay but for her pregnancy, Centrelink is satisfied that Nina is eligible for PLP and would have met the work test requirements but for pregnancy related complications.

From 1 July 2020, a person can count flexible

PPL

days (

1.1.F.70

) claimed (for a previous child) as qualifying work for a new claim.

From 30 March 2020, a day on which a person is entitled to jobkeeper payment can count as qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

For claims on or after 4 September 2021, a day on which a person is entitled to the COVID-19 disaster payment from 3 June 2021 can count as a day of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

Act reference:

PPLAct

Part 2-3 Division 2—When a person is eligible for PLP, section 36 When there is a permissible break, section 36A Premature birth or pregnancy-related complications or illness, section 34 When a person performs qualifying work, section 35A Hours of qualifying work on a flexible PPL day, section 35B Hours of qualifying work on a day in a jobkeeper payment period, section 35C Hours of qualifying work on a day in a COVID-19 Australian Government payment period

2.2.4 Work test period for COVID-19 affected claimants for PLP

Work test period for COVID-19 affected claimants

Where a claimant for PLP is a COVID-19 affected claimant (

1.1.C.165

), their work test period will be 600 days instead of 392 days.

For the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination (

1.1.I.70

), the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the expected

DOB

or placement of the child for adoption.

For the purposes of making an eligibility determination, the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the child's actual DOB or placement for adoption. If the claimant is unable to meet the work test based on the actual date of DOB or placement of the adoption, and the child was born or placed after the expected DOB or placement, the work test period is the 600 day period prior to the expected DOB or placement.

Example:

Isabelle gives birth in February 2021. She had her work hours reduced significantly from late March 2020 due to the economic impact of COVID-19 on her workplace. Due to her reduced work hours, Isabelle will not meet the work test requirements in the 392 days before the date of birth of her child.

As Isabelle's baby was born between 22 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, and she had her work hours reduced as a result of the adverse effects of COVID-19 which caused her to be unable to satisfy the work test under the usual work test period, Isabelle is a COVID-19 affected claimant. Isabelle's work test period will be 600 days before the date of birth of her child.

7.5 Other matters relating to review

Review body may determine events to have happened or not to have happened

If Centrelink or the

ART

(the review body) is reviewing a decision and is satisfied that an event would have happened had the original decision not been made, then that event can be deemed to have happened for the purposes of the review. Similarly, if an event would not have happened had the original decision not been made, then that event can be deemed to have not happened for the purposes of the review.

Example:

A person made a

PLP

claim pre-birth requesting 90 days of PLP on consecutive weekdays from the child's expected

DOB

. Centrelink determined the claimant was not eligible and, because of this, the claimant did not verify the child's birth within the required time. If, on review, the ART decides that the individual is eligible it may set the decision aside, remitting it back to Centrelink. The intention of PPLAct section 272 is to allow Centrelink to be satisfied that verification would have been provided within the required time but for the decision that the claimant was not eligible for PLP. Centrelink can seek verification of the birth when the decision is remitted back to them but still be able to treat the claim as though the verification had been provided within the required time in order to determine the person's eligibility for the flexible

PPL

days requested.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 272 Review body may determine events to have happened, or not to have happened

Certain income test determinations are not to be changed on review

If a review is being conducted by Centrelink or the ART (the review body) for the purposes of the PPL scheme, and the review involves a review of a decision that:

the person is or is not eligible for PLP, or

PLP is or is not payable to a person

AND

the review (wholly or partly) considered a determination (the income determination) that the person satisfies the income test

the income determination was taken into account in deciding that PLP is payable, and

the person did not knowingly make a false or misleading representation or provide false or misleading information in relation to the determination of income

then the review body cannot vary the income determination in such a way that the person does not satisfy the income test, or set aside the income determination and substitute it with a new determination that the person did not satisfy the income test.

The intention of this provision is that once a person has provided their

ATI

and Centrelink has decided that PLP is payable, this decision should not be overturned should it later be found that the person's ATI exceeds the income limit. This provision DOES NOT APPLY where a person knowingly provides false or misleading information/representation in relation to the income test.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 273 Certain income test determinations not to be changed on review

Settlement of proceedings before the ART

If ART review proceedings relate to the recovery of a debt, the

DSS

Secretary and other parties to the proceedings may agree, in writing, to settle the matter.

If proceedings are settled, the application for review that is the subject of proceedings is taken to be dismissed.

Act reference:

PPLAct

section 273A Settlement of proceedings before the ART

Dispute resolution processes

A dispute resolution process is a procedure or service for the voluntary resolution of disputes. It can include conferencing, mediation, neutral evaluation, conciliation and any other procedure or service specified by the President of the ART in practice directions. At any time during an ART review, the Tribunal may, by order, direct that the proceeding, or part of the proceeding be referred to dispute resolution.

For matters before the guidance and appeals panel (

1.1.G.30

), the Tribunal can only direct that the proceeding be referred for conferencing. Conferencing is an informal, private meeting between parties arranged by the ART to discuss cases.

Evidence of anything said, any act done, or any information disclosed solely for the purpose of a dispute resolution process is not admissible in the ART, before a court or before a person authorised to hear evidence.

Exception:

The evidence can be admitted in an ART review if all participating parties agree to the evidence being admitted or the evidence is a report of a neutral evaluation, and no party has objected to the report being admitted before the start of the hearing.

Act reference:

ARTAct

section 4-'dispute resolution process', section 87 Tribunal may refer to dispute resolution process, section 88 Evidence in dispute resolution process not admissible elsewhere

2.2.2 Work test for PLP

Introduction

A claimant must establish that they have or had a genuine attachment to the labour force to establish eligibility for

PLP

. In addition, in order for some claimants to be payable, another person must also meet the work test requirements (

5.2.2.20

,

5.2.2.30

).

PLP work test period

The work test period (

1.1.W.40

) for PLP is generally the 392-day period (that is, a period of approximately 13 months) for people other than COVID-19 affected claimants, and the 600-day period (that is, a period of approximately 20 months) for COVID-19 affected claimants, prior to the expected or actual

DOB

or placement of the child for adoption, or the date the person became the primary carer of the child.

Initial eligibility determinations

For the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination (

1.1.I.70

) (a pre-birth claim), a person’s eligibility in relation to the work test is established by examining the work performed within the 392-day period prior to the expected DOB or placement of the child for adoption.

Eligibility determinations

For the purposes of making an eligibility determination (where the decision is made after birth), a person's work test period is established by examining the work performed within the 392-day period prior to the child's actual DOB or placement of the child for adoption. If the person is unable to meet the work test based on the actual date of DOB or placement of the adoption, and the child was born or placed after the expected DOB or placement, the work test may be applied to the 392 days prior to the expected DOB or placement. The work test period for a

PPL

claimant in exceptional circumstances and their partner commences 392 days prior to the day the PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances became the primary carer of the child.

If the Secretary is satisfied that a PPL claimant or special PPL claimant who is the partner of a PPL claimant in exceptional circumstances meets the work test and income test requirements on the day a payability determination is made that the claimant is not payable, then the claimant is conditionally eligible for flexible PPL days for the child (

1.1.C.143

).

Hazardous jobs for PLP

For a birth mother who does not meet the work test because they ceased work due to hazards connected to their work that posed a risk to their pregnancy, the work test period will be the 392 days prior to the day the claimant is no longer performing work in the hazardous job (

2.2.3

).

COVID-19 affected claimants

For the purposes of making an initial eligibility determination for a claimant who is a COVID-19 affected claimant (

1.1.C.165

), the work test period is the 600-day period prior to the expected date of birth or adoption.

For the purposes of making an eligibility determination for claimant who is a COVID-19 affected claimant, the work test period is the 600-day period prior to the child's actual DOB or placement for adoption. If the claimant is unable to meet the work test based on the actual date of DOB or placement of the adoption, and the child was born or placed after the expected DOB or placement, the work test period is the 600-day period prior to the expected DOB or placement.

Qualifying period

For the purposes of the work test, a qualifying period is a period of 295 consecutive days (approximately 10 months) in a person's work test period that are days:

on which the person has performed qualifying work (

2.2.7

), or

that fall within a permissible break (

2.2.8

).

Days on which a person has not performed qualifying work that do not fall within a permissible break cannot be considered when calculating if the person has a 295 consecutive day qualifying period.

Qualifying work

In addition to meeting the requirements of the 295-day qualifying period, a person must have performed at least 330 hours of qualifying work within the qualifying period.

A person performs qualifying work on a day if they perform at least one hour of paid work on the day or if they take a period of paid leave of at least one hour on a day.

It is not necessary for work to have been performed with a single employer. Work performed with more than one employer in the work test period may count towards the work test. From 1 March 2014, a person can count the days in a PPL period for a previous child as qualifying work for a new claim. From 1 July 2020, a person can also count flexible PPL days (

1.1.F.70

) for a previous child as qualifying work for a new claim.

From 30 March 2020, a day on which a person is entitled to jobkeeper payment can count as a day of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

For claims made on or after 4 September 2021, a day on which a person is entitled to the COVID-19 disaster payment from 3 June 2021 can count as a day of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP.

Hours of qualifying work on a day in a PPL period

For children born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process on or after 1 March 2014, a person can count the days in their PPL period for a previous child as qualifying work for a new claim for PLP. From 1 July 2020, any flexible PPL days for a previous child can also count as qualifying work for a new claim.

If a person did not perform paid work or take paid leave during their PPL period for a previous child, the hours of work the person is taken to have performed on that day is:

7.6 if the day is a weekday, and

no hours if the day is a Saturday or Sunday.

If a person did not perform paid work or take paid leave on a flexible PPL day for a previous child, the person is taken to have performed 7.6 hours of work on that day, including weekends.

If a person performed at least one hour of paid work on a day during their PPL period for a previous child, the hours of work the person is taken to have performed on the day is the greater of:

7.6 hours of PLP if the day is a weekday, and

the actual number of hours of paid work performed by the person on that day.

If a person performed at least one hour of paid work on a day on a flexible PPL day for a previous child, the hours of work the person is taken to have performed on that day is the greater of 7.6 hours of PLP (if the day is a weekday or a weekend), and the actual number of hours of paid work performed by the person on that day.

If a person took paid leave of at least one hour during their PPL period for a previous child, the hours of work the person is taken to have performed on the day is the greater of:

7.6 hours of PLP if the day is a weekday, and

the number of hours of paid leave taken by the person on that day.

If the person takes paid leave of at least one hour on a flexible PPL day for a previous child, the hours of work the person is taken to have performed on that day is the greater of 7.6 hours of PLP (if the day is a weekday or a weekend), and the actual number of hours of paid leave taken by the person on that day.

Example:

A person may be taking 3 hours of paid leave on a flexible PPL day. In this circumstance, the person will be taken to have performed 7.6 hours of qualifying work on that day, whether or not the day is a weekday or weekend.

A person in receipt of the jobkeeper payment or COVID-19 disaster payment will be taken to have performed 7.6 hours of qualifying work for the purposes of the work test for PLP for each weekday (no hours for a Saturday or Sunday) during a period/s of jobkeeper payment or COVID-19 disaster payment.

Where a person has performed at least one hour of paid work or received at least one hour of paid leave on a day during a jobkeeper payment period or COVID-19 disaster payment period, the person will be taken to have performed qualifying work for the greater of 7.6 hours or the number of hours actually worked or number of hours of paid leave received.

Where a person performs at least one hour of paid work on a day and the day is a Saturday or Sunday that falls in a jobkeeper payment period or COVID-19 disaster payment period, the person will be taken to have worked the hours actually performed on that day (instead of no hours).

Example:

Sarah performs 9 hours of work on a Monday that is in a jobkeeper payment period because she is required to work overtime. However, on Tuesday her hours are reduced to 4 hours due to a decrease in demand, and on Wednesday reduced to nil hours. It would be unfair to determine that on Monday, when she was required to work overtime due to the constantly fluctuating nature of the current work environment, she be taken to have performed 7.6 hours of work because she was working during a jobkeeper payment period. Therefore, the greater of the 2 should be taken into account when applying the PLP work test. In Sarah's case, the 9 hours actually worked would be counted for Monday not 7.6 hours. Sarah would be taken to have performed 7.6 hours of work on Tuesday, Wednesday.

7.1.2.30 Internal review of employer funding amount decision

Introduction

If Centrelink is required to pay a

PPL

funding amount to an employer but the employer has not been paid enough to fund the employee's first instalment of

PLP

by the first payroll cut-off, Centrelink must pay the PPL funding amount before the next payroll cut-off. If Centrelink does not do this the employer may apply, in writing, to Centrelink for review of an employer funding amount decision.

Exception:

An employer cannot apply for review of an employer funding amount decision that was made personally by a PPL agency representative. In this case they may apply for

ART

review.

Timing of application for internal review of employer funding amount decision

An application for review of an employer funding amount determination may only be made within 14 days after the day of the second payroll cut-off in relation to the PPL funding amount.

Example:

An employer may seek a review where Centrelink has not paid enough (or any) of a PPL funding amount to the employer to enable the employer to pay an instalment of PLP that is payable to an employee. The reason for a 14-day time limit for employers is to ensure that claimants do not experience delays in the payment of PLP payments.

Content of application for internal review of employer funding amount decision

An application for review of an employer funding amount decision must be signed by a person authorised by the employer.

Notice of decision relating to an employer

Written notice is required when a decision is made on an internal review relating to an employer. See

7.1.5

for the requirements of this notice.

1.1.P.165 PPL claim

Definition

There are 2 types of claims for

PLP

: a

PPL

claim and a special PPL claim.

Centrelink cannot make a determination that PLP is payable to a person for a child unless a person has made an effective PPL claim or special PPL claim. Only a natural person can make a claim.

A PPL claim must be in the form approved by Centrelink, must contain any information required by Centrelink, and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink.

Only the following people can make an effective PPL claim for a child:

the child’s birth mother

an adoptive parent of the child

a person who is a parent of the child and is not the child’s birth mother
