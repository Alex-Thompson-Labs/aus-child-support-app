2.8.3 ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

Introduction

ACCS

(temporary financial hardship) is designed to provide support to families who are experiencing significant temporary financial stress due to circumstances beyond their control. This extra assistance will help ensure continuity of care for children and ensure that families are provided with support when they need it most.

Individuals (

1.1.I.90

) will receive the ACCS (temporary financial hardship) payment equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120% of the

CCS

hourly rate cap (

1.1.H.20

), for up to 100 hours per fortnight. The family will not have to meet the CCS participation requirements. ACCS (temporary financial hardship) will be provided for a maximum of 13 weeks per temporary financial hardship circumstance.

3.1.7.05 Maintenance income credit

Background

From 1 July 2006 individuals who receive

FTB

and who are entitled to maintenance income that is registered for collection by Child Support may access a

MIC

balance. The MIC balance represents the unused amount of

MIFA

(

1.1.M.21

) from past income years. When the individual or their partner receives arrears of maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

), the MIC balance may be drawn upon to reduce the amount of arrears counted under the maintenance income test.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 Part 2 Division 5 Subdivision B Maintenance income credit balances

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7

Maintenance income test,

3.1.1.20

Current FTB rates & income test amounts

Eligibility

To accrue a MIC balance, an individual or their partner must be eligible for FTB and be entitled to maintenance income that is registered for collection by Child Support.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24B Accruals to a maintenance income credit balance

Availability

The MIC is available to individuals at the end of year reconciliation or lump sum payment of FTB. This will occur if the individual received child support arrears in that financial year and had a MIC balance above zero at the end of the previous financial year.

Example:

At the end of the previous income year Carrie had a MIC balance. She receives child support arrears during the current income year. These arrears can be offset against her MIC balance when her FTB entitlement for the current income year is reconciled.

Types of maintenance payments that can be credited against the MIC

The types of maintenance payments that can be credited against the MIC balance are periodic payments covered under the Child Support Scheme that are registered for Child Support collection.

Maintenance payments registered for private collection are not credited against the MIC as it is assumed that the full maintenance entitlement is received during private collect periods.

Explanation:

While the maintenance income test also applies to maintenance entitlements that are privately collected, from 1 July 2012, if an individual chooses private collection, they are deemed to be collecting 100% of their entitlement. If the individual is unable to collect 100%, they are able to transfer to Child Support collection and Child Support is able to collect a period of unpaid private arrears (

3.1.6.80

). Alternatively, the individual may take effective action to collect the arrears privately or seek an exemption from the

MAT

. Prior to 1 July 2012, if an individual was unable to privately collect 100% of their entitlement, they may have been deemed to have failed the maintenance action test.

Changing the method of collection

Accruing a MIC balance

The earliest date for accruing a MIC balance is the later of 1 July 2000 or the day the individual or their partner became eligible for FTB.

The accrual amount is equal to the amount of MIFA that would have been used if the correct amount of maintenance income had been received when it was due. Therefore, the MIC accrual is equal to the lower of:

the MIFA, less the annualised amount of maintenance income received, or

the annualised amount of the maintenance income entitlement less the annualised amount of maintenance income received.

Example 1:

Samantha has one child and is entitled to receive child support of $3,000 for the income year but received $500. Samantha's MIFA is determined to be $1,335.90. Samantha's MIC accrual is $1,335.90 - $500 ($835.90).

Example 2:

Miranda has 2 children and was entitled to receive child support of $1,000 but received $500. Samantha's MIFA is determined to be $1,335.90, as her annualised maintenance income entitlement is used in the MIC calculation. Miranda's MIC accrual for that year is $500, that is, $1,000 - $500. The amount of MIC accrual cannot exceed the amount of child support that should have been paid.

Example 3:

Charlotte has one child and was entitled to receive child support of $800 for one year and $825 the following year. She received $200 in child support for each of those years. Her MIFA was determined to be $1,292.10 and $1,335.90 for the 2 years. Her MIC accrual for the 2 years is $600 for the first year and $625 for the following year.

Where there is more than one Child Support registered liability that has been underpaid between an individual and their partner, the combined MIC accrual is equal to the lower of:

the MIFA, less the combined annualised amount of maintenance income received, or

the combined annualised maintenance income entitlement less the combined annualised amount of maintenance income received.

An individual and their partner may each have a MIC balance. An individual or their partner may have more than one MIC balance if they are entitled to maintenance income from more than one child support payer. The apportioning of a combined MIC accrual between liabilities is on an equal basis up to a cap. The cap has the effect that the apportioning to a liability cannot exceed the amount of maintenance that was underpaid for that liability. Any remaining accrual is distributed to the remaining liabilities until the MIC balance is used up or the cap for all liabilities has been reached.

The following examples assume that the individual's MIFA was $2,759.40 in 2005-06 and 2006-07.

Example 1:

Mark was entitled to receive child support of $3,000 in 2005-06 but received nil and his partner was entitled to receive child support of $2,000 but received nil. The MIC accrual for 2005-06 would be a combined amount of $2,759.40 (the full MIFA) and would be apportioned as half each ($1,379.70) to Mark and his partner.

Example 2:

Peter was entitled to receive child support of $2,000 in 2005-06 but received $500 and his partner was entitled to receive child support of $1,000 but received nil. The MIC accrual for 2005-06 would be a combined amount of $2,259.40 (the MIFA of $2,759.40 less maintenance income of $500) and is apportioned as $1,259.40 to Peter's MIC balance, and $1,000 to his partner's MIC balance.

Example 3:

Nick was entitled to receive child support of $2,400 in 2005-06 but received $2,200 and his partner was entitled to receive child support of $1,000 but received nil. The MIC accrual for 2005-06 would be a combined amount of $559.40 (the MIFA of $2,759.40 less maintenance income of $2,200), and would be apportioned as $200 to Nick's MIC balance (the underpaid amount of $2,400 less $2,200), and the remainder of $359.40 to his partner's balance.

Where there is more than one MIC balance, there may be accrual to one MIC balance, and depletion from another MIC balance, in the same income year. Where MIC accrual and MIC depletion occur in the same income year, the accrual calculation excludes any disregarded arrears due to MIC depletion. That is, the depletion calculation occurs before the accrual calculation.

Example 4:

Pip was entitled to receive child support of $1,000 in 2006-07 but received $1,500 and her partner was entitled to receive child support of $2,000 but received nil. Pip has an available MIC balance of $700 from previous financial years. The arrears of $500 that Pip received, is offset by her $700 MIC balance, reducing her MIC balance to $200. Pip's received amount of $1,500 is reduced by the MIC balance of $500, meaning her new received amount of child support is $1,000. The MIC accrual for 2006-07 would be a combined amount of $1,759.40 (the MIFA of $2,759.40 less maintenance income of $1,000), and the entire amount would accrue to her partner's MIC balance.

Example 5:

Patricia was entitled to receive child support of $1,000 in 2006-07 but received $1,500 and her partner was entitled to receive child support of $2,000 but received nil. Patricia has a MIC balance of nil at the end of 2005-06. The MIC accrual for 2006-07 would be a combined amount of $1,259.40 (the MIFA of $2,759.40 less maintenance income of $1,500), and the entire amount would accrue to Patricia's partner's MIC balance. Patricia's received amount of $1,500 is not reduced by an available MIC balance, therefore the whole amount is assessed as part of the reconciliation.

6.4.2.30

FTB reconciliation due to maintenance income

MIC balance cannot be greater than outstanding child support arrears

At any particular time, the MIC balance for a registered maintenance liability is equal to the balance of the accruals and the depletions that have occurred in relation to that liability. The MIC balance cannot exceed the total child support arrears owing from that liability for all income years for which the liability has existed. Child Support will advise Centrelink at the end of each income year the amount of child support arrears outstanding on a child support case, and the individual's MIC balance cannot exceed this amount.

Depletion from the MIC balance

An individual or their partner is regarded as receiving arrears of maintenance income if the amount received is greater than the ongoing liability that is due in a particular income year. The MIC balance is depleted (at reconciliation) whenever arrears are received. The amount depleted is the lower of the arrears received or the amount of the MIC balance.

Example:

The MIC balance at the end of 2005-06 is $2,500. If arrears of $1,500 are received in 2006-07, the MIC balance at the end of 2006-07 would be $1,000 and no arrears would be counted in working out an individual's annualised maintenance income under the maintenance income test at reconciliation. If arrears of $1,500 are received the following year in 2007-08, the MIC balance at the end of that year would be nil and only $500 arrears would be counted under the maintenance income test when payment of FTB is reconciled for 2007-08.

An individual is not able to access their MIC balance for a particular income year until their FTB entitlement has been reconciled. For individuals receiving their FTB by instalments, this means that any arrears of maintenance received during an income year continue to be counted when determining their rate of FTB before reconciliation.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24E Depletions from a maintenance income credit balance

Capitalised maintenance income

Arrears of maintenance that may be offset against the MIC is periodic maintenance that is registered for collection by Child Support. Therefore capitalised maintenance income is not relevant in depletion of the MIC balance. However, in working out the individual's accrual amount, capitalised maintenance affects the size of unused MIFA.

Example:

In 2006-07 Anika is entitled to receive $3,300 in periodic child support. She receives $700 in periodic child support. Anika also has an annualised amount of $500 in capitalised maintenance in that year. Anika's MIFA is $2,025.75. The amount of MIC that she accrues for that year is $2,025 - $1,200 = $825.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.13

Capitalised maintenance

Change in circumstances

The accrual of a MIC amount is calculated on a daily basis because an individual's circumstances can change throughout the income year, which can vary their MIFA throughout the year.

Example:

In 2005-06 Suzy had care of her daughter for the first 100 days. Her son then came into her care as well for the remaining 265 days. The MIFA initially was $1,182.60 and then increased to $1,576.80. Suzy was entitled to receive child support of $3,000 in 2005-06 but received nil. Her daily MIC accrual would be $3.24 ($1,182.60 ÷ 365) for 100 days and $4.32 ($1,576.80 ÷ 365) for 265 days. Suzy's total accrual is $1,468.80 for 2005-06.

Children for whom base rate is payable

The amount of depletion from a MIC balance excludes any child support arrears that are not counted in calculating maintenance income, such as arrears paid for children over 16 years who are not senior secondary school children (

1.1.S.27

).

Example:

Elsie has 2 children aged 12 and 18, and her 18 year old child completed their year 12 qualification prior to the start of the financial year. In 2006-07 Elsie receives a total of $5,000 in child support, which includes arrears of $2,000. Her MIC balance at the end of 2005-06 is $1,800. The arrears of $1,000 for the child aged 18 are disregarded because only base rate is payable for that child. Only the arrears of $1,000 for her 12 year old child are offset against her MIC balance of $1,800 leaving a balance of $800 at the end of 2006-07. No arrears are counted under the maintenance income test when Elsie's FTB payments are reconciled for 2006-07.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.12

Exempt maintenance income

Periods of ineligibility

An individual who ceases to be eligible for FTB may have a MIC balance at that time. During their period of ineligibility there can be no accrual of a MIC. However, MIC depletion can still occur if they receive child support arrears. Later eligibility for FTB takes into account the previous MIC balance and any depletion from the MIC balance that occurred while they were ineligible.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24A(4) Maintenance income credit balances, Schedule 1 clause 24B(2) Conditions that must be satisfied

Where previous years of FTB have not been reconciled

It is possible that an individual's FTB may be reconciled for a particular income year when they have not yet had their FTB reconciled for an earlier year, and where the earlier year could result in an accrual or depletion for that year. This can occur where tax returns are not lodged in sequence.

If arrears were received in the earlier income year, the arrears would deplete the MIC balance. If the amount of maintenance income received in the earlier income year was less than the amount due in that year and less than the MIFA, there is a 'potential MIC accrual' that may arise upon reconciliation for that year.

From the 2012-13 financial year, the time limit for the potential MIC accrual to occur is the one year time limit that applies for lodging tax returns or advising non lodger details, to satisfy the FTB reconciliation conditions. Extensions to the tax lodgement timeframe may be granted in special circumstances.

Prior to the 2012-13 financial year individuals had 2 years to satisfy FTB reconciliation conditions.

Example 1:

For 2005-06, the time limit to lodge a tax return was 30 June 2008. Reconciliation for 2006-07 may occur before the time limit expires for 2005-06. If so, the potential MIC accrual for the earlier year (2005-06) would not be taken into account at that stage.

Example 2:

In 2 October 2007, Katherine's FTB for 2006-07 is ready to be reconciled, and 2004-05 is the last income year that has been reconciled. The MIC balance is $2,000 at the end of 2004-05. It is known that there is a potential MIC accrual of $1,500 for 2005-06. Also, arrears have been received in 2006-07. Reconciliation for 2006-07 would proceed on the basis that the MIC balance before depletion for 2006-07 is $2,000 (not $3,500). In December 2007, Katherine's FTB for 2005-06 is ready to be reconciled. An additional accrual of $1,500 occurs for 2005-06, giving a MIC balance of $3,500 instead of $2,000 at the end of 2005-06. The reconciliation calculation for 2006-07 based on the original MIC balance of $2,000 would be revisited, substituting a MIC balance before depletion for 2006-07 of $3,500.

Example 3

: Anna's MIC balance was $1,500 at the end of 2011-12. There is a potential MIC accrual of $2,000 for 2012-13 and in 2013-14 Anna received arrears.

In August 2014, Anna lodges her tax return for 2013-14, but has failed to lodge her tax return for 2012-13. Reconciliation for 2013-14 proceeds on the basis that the MIC balance before depletion for 2013-14 is $1,500 (not $3,500).

In November 2014, Anna lodges her tax return for 2012-13. Due to changes to lodgement periods, she cannot receive any supplements or top-ups for 2012-13, nor can her MIC accrue the $2,000. The reconciliation calculation for 2013-14 based on the original MIC balance of $1,500 would remain the same (that is, it cannot be revisited as Anna did not meet lodgement requirements for the 2012-13 financial year).

6.4.1 Overview of reconciliation

Introduction

This section gives an overview of reconciliation.

Reconciliation is the process of determining an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) eligibility for

FTB

and

CCS

. For the purposes of FTB and CCS, this process also determines an individual's correct rate of payment for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

). Depending on an individual's circumstances, this involves comparing the FTB and/or CCS received during the relevant income year, based on their estimated

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

), maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

) (for FTB), and child care usage (for CCS), with their actual entitlement (

1.1.E.30

), based on their:

actual ATI (provided in part by the

ATO

)

actual maintenance income (FTB Part A only), and

session reports (

1.1.S.35

) submitted by approved providers (

1.1.A.90

).

The purpose of reconciliation is to determine whether an individual was eligible to receive payment and, if so, whether they received their correct entitlement.

An adjustment takes place in cases where reconciliation shows a difference between the amount of

FA

the individual received, based on estimated income, and their correct entitlement, based on actual income.

The following table shows where more information on reconciliation can be found.

CCS Reconciliation

The payment of CCS and

ACCS

generally occurs by way of a weekly or fortnightly payment made directly to approved providers. Any CCS owed to families following the end of year reconciliation process will be paid directly to individuals as a lump sum. Conversely, if any overpayment occurred because the individual underestimated their income, these amounts will be raised as a debt against the individual.

4.1.1.10 TFN requirements for FTB

Summary

In making an effective claim (

1.1.E.10

) for

FTB

, an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is required to provide a

TFN

statement for each TFN claim person or TFN substitution person (

1.1.T.50

), as relevant. In some circumstances, a TFN may be required again later after the claim has been determined. In this case, the TFNs may be required for each TFN determination person. This topic includes information about the following:

An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) is not required to provide a TFN when claiming FTB.

Explanation:

FTB is not reconciled for ACOs and therefore there is no need for ACOs to provide TFNs.

TFNs required after claim is determined

If the claim for FTB has already been determined, and the TFNs are required, the applicant (

1.1.A.72

) and their partner (

1.1.P.30

), if they have one, are TFN determination persons.

Examples:

An applicant provided a TFN when they lodged the claim, and FTB was granted, but the TFN was subsequently found to be invalid for some reason.

An applicant provided their own TFN when making a claim for FTB, and was granted a temporary exemption for their partner's TFN. The exemption is later reviewed, and the partner's TFN is requested.

Providing a TFN

Only the applicant can provide a TFN. If the TFN is not available, another kind of TFN statement can be made by:

the TFN claim person, or

the surviving TFN substitution person.

The applicant must provide the TFN statement on the claim form. Their partner, or the surviving TFN substitution person, must provide their TFN statement on the approved form, which must be given with the claim form for instalment claims and past period claims.

1.1.C.27 Claim (CCS)

Definition: claim for

CCS

Only individuals (

1.1.I.90

) can make a claim for CCS in respect of a child. There are 2 kinds of claims individuals can make:

by fee reduction, or

in substitution for an individual who has died.

Definition: claim by fee reduction

An individual must make a claim to be eligible for CCS by fee reduction in respect of a child. In assessing an individual's claim for CCS, Centrelink must make 2 decisions:

whether the claim is effective (

4.6.1.10

), and

if the claim is effective, whether the individual meets the basic eligibility requirements, referred to as an 'initial determination of eligibility' (

2.6.1

).

An initial determination of eligibility in relation to a child establishes the individual as an active claimant - someone for whom entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) determinations can be made if the child attends care provided by an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

).

The claim process also collects information needed to determine initial entitlement details for the individual. This includes information about the individual's (and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

)) income and participation, which is needed to establish their initial CCS percentage and subsidised hours result, respectively. Information about the child's education level is also collected to establish the relevant hourly rate cap for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided to the child.

The CCS claim process is also used to collect information to determine if the individual is eligible to be paid

ACCS

grandparent (

2.8.2

). If applying to other ACCS payments (

2.8

), separate applications will need to be made by the individual, or the provider in the case of ACCS child wellbeing (

2.8.1

).

3.10 Determining the SIFS rate

Introduction

SIFS

has been closed to new recipients since 1 July 2017. Grandfathering arrangements permit eligible recipients with entitlement to SIFS at 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS as long as they continuously remain eligible for the payment. See

2.11.1

SIFS provides assistance of up to $300 a year to individuals or couples who have a qualifying child (

2.11.2

), where the main income earner has a taxable income (

1.1.T.50

) between $68,000 and $150,000. If there is a secondary earner in the family, their income needs to be below $18,000.

The annual rate of SIFS is calculated based on taxable income.

For couples, there is a primary earner income test and a secondary earner income test.

For sole parents, there is only a primary earner income test.

There will be no indexation (

1.1.I.80

) of the maximum rate or income threshold amounts.

Primary earner income test

The primary earner in a couple is the member whose taxable income is the higher.

The rate of SIFS is nil for taxable income of $68,000 or less.

For each dollar above $68,000, SIFS entitlement increases by $0.025 until the maximum rate of $300 is reached at $80,000.

The SIFS rate then stays at $300 between $80,000 and $120,000.

For each dollar above $120,000, the SIFS rate decreases by $0.01 until it is reduced to nil at $150,000.

Secondary earner income test

The secondary earner is the member of a couple whose taxable income is the lower.

If the SIFS rate payable after the primary earner income test (the provisional rate) is more than zero, the secondary earner income test is then applied to work out any reduction of the provisional rate.

There is no SIFS reduction where the secondary earner's taxable income is $16,000 or less.

For each dollar above $16,000, the SIFS rate decreases by $0.15 until the provisional rate is reduced to nil.

The income level at which the provisional rate is reduced to nil varies depending on the amount of the provisional rate.

If the provisional rate is the maximum rate of $300, the provisional rate would be reduced to nil at $18,000.

If a couple has the same taxable income, the same amount of taxable income is used in the primary earner income test and the secondary earner income test. As the primary earner test phases in at $68,000 and the secondary earner text phases out at $18,000, if the incomes were the same, only one condition would be met and accordingly the resulting rate is nil.

Determining the rate of SIFS

An individual's entitlement to

FTB

based on at least one FTB child or an individual's effective claim for SIFS would result in a SIFS determination after the end of the particular income year. However, a determination would not be made in relation to a period in the income year until an assessment has been made of the taxable income for that income year of:

the individual entitled to FTB or claiming SIFS if the individual is required to lodge an income tax return for that year, and

the individual's partner in that period if the partner is required to lodge an income tax return for that year. (This refers to the individual's partner at any time during that year).

Method of determining rate of SIFS

A method statement that applies where the main income earner's taxable income (rounded down to the nearest dollar) is more than $68,000 and less than $150,000.

Step 1 requires working out the main income earner's taxable income.

Step 2 provides that the main income earner's taxable income is reduced by $68,000.

Step 3 multiplies the amount established in Step 2 by 0.025.

Step 4 provides that, if the amount in step 3 is less than or equal to $300, this is the individual's provisional component.

Step 5 provides that, if the amount in step 3 is greater than $300, the provisional component is $300 if the main income earner's taxable income exceeds $80,000 but does not exceed $120,000, or, if their taxable income exceeds $120,000, the provisional component is $300 less $0.01 for each dollar of the excess.

Step 6 provides that, if the individual is not a member of a couple, the annual rate of SIFS is the provisional component.

Step 7 provides that, if the individual is a member of a couple, then the annual rate is the provisional component less any reduction under step 8.

Step 8 provides that, if the low income earner's taxable income (rounded down to the nearest dollar) is greater than $16,000, the provisional component is reduced by $0.15 for each dollar of the excess.

Example:

George has one qualifying child. George was not a member of a couple from 1 July until 25 December 2016 (178 days). George was a member of a couple with Mildred from 26 December until 30 June 2017 (187 days). George has a taxable income of $125,000 and is the primary income earner. Mildred had a taxable income of $17,000 and was the secondary income earner during their partnership.

Determination of rate:

Step 1: main income earner = $125,000

Step 2: $125,000 − $68,000 = $57,000

Step 3: $57,000 × 0.025 = $1,425

Step 4: provisional amount = $300 (because $1450 is greater than $300)

Step 5: main income earner's taxable income of $125,000 exceeds $120,000 by $5,000

$5,000 × $0.01 = $50

$300 − $50 = $250

Provisional component = $250

$250 ÷ 365 days = $0.69

178 days × $0.69 = $122.82 (for the period when George was single)

Step 6: as the secondary income earner's taxable income of $17,000 is greater than $16,000 by $1,000, this reduces the provisional component by

$1,000 × $0.15 = $150

Step 7: annual rate is the provisional component of $250 less reduction under step 6

$250 − $150 = $100

$100 ÷ 365 days = $0.28

187 days × $0.28 = $52.36 (for the period when George was partnered)

Total SIFS payment to George = $122.82 + $52.36 = $175.18

Daily rate of SIFS

An annual rate of SIFS is calculated and then converted to a daily rate by dividing by 365, always rounding up to the nearest cent.

An individual's SIFS payment is then the sum of the daily SIFS rates for the applicable days in the relevant financial year, as calculated above.

Shared care

Where more than one adult has care of a qualifying SIFS child for at least 35% of the time, this child is in a shared care relationship (

2.1.1.20

). Each individual's percentage of care does not affect their rate of SIFS. This means that SIFS is paid at the appropriate income tested rate regardless of shared care. The maximum amount of SIFS an individual can receive per relevant period is up to around $300, however a singular child may be the qualifying SIFS child for more than one individual.

Blended rates

Where a couple in a blended family (

1.1.B.30

) is eligible for SIFS, each member is eligible to receive a percentage of the total SIFS payment attracted by the family.

The total SIFS payment attracted by the family is split according to the blended family percentages that applied daily throughout the relevant financial year using existing family assistance blended family rules.

The total maximum SIFS payment received by a blended family in a given financial year is up to around $300.

4.3.2 Payment cycles for FTB instalments

Summary

When an individual is paid

FTB

by instalments their entitlement is paid fortnightly in arrears. Payment is made on the FTB delivery day (

1.1.P.73

), which is 2 working days after the end of the instalment period. This topic covers the following:

instalment periods (

1.1.I.100

)

setting instalment periods

choosing the FTB delivery day

payment for blended families (

1.1.B.30

)

payment for

ACO

s (

1.1.A.80

), and

instalment amount.

Instalment periods

An instalment period is normally 14 days, ending 2 working days before the delivery day.

There are 10 possible instalment period end days, for the 10 weekdays in a 14-day period. Instalment periods for FTB are the same as entitlement periods for social security payments made by Centrelink. Each weekday has an assigned code for the entitlement period end day.

An instalment period can be less than 14 days:

for the first instalment (see explanation 1)

if eligibility for FTB has ceased (see explanation 2), or

if the individual changes their delivery day.

Explanation 1:

Entitlement period end day codes (

1.1.E.40

) provide more information.

Explanation 2:

If the individual loses eligibility to FTB, the last instalment period includes only the days for which an instalment amount is owing.

Setting instalment periods

The rules for setting an FTB instalment period for individuals and their partners who are receiving a payment from Centrelink are described in the following table.

If the FTB individual receives …

and their partner receives …

then the instalment period ends …

no other payment

no other payment

14 days after the claim is lodged, or

on another weekday chosen by the individual.

no other payment

a social security benefit (

1.1.S.60

), or pension (

1.1.S.90

)

the same period as their partner's, or

the same day but in the alternate week to their partner.

Explanation:

The FTB recipient can choose.

a social security benefit or pension

no other payment

the same period as their other payment, or

the same day but in the alternate week.

Explanation:

The FTB recipient can choose.

By aligning FTB instalment periods with the entitlement periods for other social security payments, any changes in circumstances that affect both payments can be applied at the same time. This means that changes in rates will occur at the same time in relation to the same event.

Choosing the FTB delivery day

The individual can choose their FTB delivery day depending on whether they or their partner receive a social security benefit or pension from Centrelink. Delivery days for different payments are shown in the table below.

If the payment is …

then the delivery day is …

family tax benefit

2 working days after the end of the instalment period.

a social security benefit, but not

PP

(partnered)

the next working day after the end of the instalment period.

a social security pension, or

PP (partnered)

2 working days after the end of the instalment period.

As the table above shows, a couple with the same instalment period end date, or the end date offset by a week may have different delivery days. The discrepancy is due to the difference in time required by financial institutions to process social security benefit payments compared to other payments.

If an individual changes their FTB delivery day, an adjustment payment (

1.1.A.30

) is made to align the instalment period with the new delivery day. The adjustment payment is for the number of days since the end of the previous instalment period up to the beginning of the new instalment period.

Payment for blended families

The requirement to align instalment periods does not apply where payment of FTB has been shared between members of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) in a blended family.

Explanation:

A couple in a blended family who have asked to share their FTB entitlement may want their payments kept separate. They may have nominated different accounts for direct credit, and may wish to be paid on different days.

Payment for ACOs

ACOs are paid fortnightly instalments of FTB for children in their care. An ACO has a Centrelink record similar to that of individuals.

Instalment amount

The instalment amount of FTB is calculated as the sum of the daily rates for the relevant days in the instalment period, including weekends. A change in rate only affects the days in the instalment period following the date of effect of the change.

Example:

Susan is paid FTB by instalments for their 3 FTB children. Susan notifies Centrelink as soon as one of the children leaves their care. Susan's FTB is varied from the date the child left care, which is the sixth day of their instalment period. Susan's instalment amount for the period is 5 days at the higher rate and 9 days at the reduced rate.

3.1.6.45 Child support agreements (post July 2008)

Summary

This topic provides information about child support agreements made on or after 1 July 2008 and how they are assessed under the maintenance income test (MIT) for

FTB

Part A. It covers the following:

child support agreements

limited agreements

binding agreements, and

lump sum agreements.

Child support agreements

When parents separate, rather than collecting the amount of child support as assessed under child support legislation, the parents may choose to enter in to a child support agreement. Child support agreements are arrangements made between separated parents as to the amount of child support to be transferred to the payee by the payer. Child support agreements can also stipulate the way in which child support is paid.

Example:

Lump sum payments (including property settlement), periodic cash payments or non-cash payments. Non-cash payments may include mortgage repayments, rental payments and school fees.

Agreements can either be limited or binding. Limited agreements must be equal to or greater than the child support assessment as determined by Child Support. Binding agreements are child support agreements where legal advice has been sought by both parents and can be for any amount. In either case, FTB will be calculated using the amount of child support that would have otherwise been payable under the formula, which is known as the notional assessment (

1.1.N.45

).

Limited agreements

Limited agreements are formal agreements made in writing and signed by both parents and can be made by both parties without seeking legal advice. Limited agreements must be made after a child support formula assessment has been made and the agreement amount must be equal to or more than the formula amount.

Child Support will make a new notional assessment every 3 years, or if the amount of child support payable under the agreement changes by more than 15%, or on a request from either parent.

The notional assessment is updated by Child Support to ensure Centrelink uses the appropriate child support amounts to calculate the payee's FTB Part A payment and also allows parents to know how much child support would have been payable if the agreement was not in place.

Limited agreements can be ended if:

the parties agree to end the agreement

more than 3 years has passed with the existing agreement in place, and written notice is provided by a party to end the agreement

there is a court order that sets aside the agreement

the notional assessment varies by more than 15% from the previous notional assessment, in circumstances not contemplated by the agreement, and one of the parties gives notice to end the agreement

a new agreement replaces the existing agreement, or

the carer entitled to receive child support under the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the relevant child.

Act reference:

CSA Act

section 80G Terminating limited child support agreements

Policy reference:

CS Guide

6.1.3

Limited child support agreements

Binding agreements

Binding agreements are formal agreements made in writing and signed by both parents following independent legal advice. A binding agreement can be for any amount of child support that parents agree to, even if this amount is less than the child support formula amount.

For an agreement to be registered as a binding child support agreement, each parent must obtain independent legal advice about the effect of the agreement and the advantages and disadvantages of making one.

A binding child support agreement cannot be varied and can only be terminated if:

the parties make a subsequent binding agreement that includes a provision that terminates the previous agreement

the parties make a binding termination agreement

a court order is made that sets aside the agreement, or

the carer entitled to receive child support under the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the relevant child.

Act reference:

CSA Act

section 80D Terminating binding child support agreements

Policy reference:

CS Guide

6.1.2

Binding child support agreements

Refusing to extend binding agreement

Binding child support agreements may be extended beyond a child's 18th birthday until the end of the secondary school year. Where the binding agreement initiated the child support case, both parties to the agreement must sign any application for extension.

If one party refuses to extend a binding agreement, the party that attempted to extend the case is considered to have taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for the affected children will not be reduced to the base rate because they have satisfied the

MAT

(

3.1.5.40

).

However, in most cases if the payee does not take steps to extend the child support case (obtain maintenance) the payee is deemed to have not taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will be reduced due to failing the MAT.

Agreements or orders for lump sum payments

Agreements can be made which provide for the payment of child support by a lump sum. The agreement must be a binding agreement and the value of the lump sum must be equal to or more than the value of the annual child support payable under a Child Support determined child support assessment.

The lump sum is credited against the annual child support liability and is credited in this way until the lump sum is reduced to nil. After the value of the lump sum is reduced to nil ongoing child support payments will resume.

In calculating FTB, the MIT is based on the amount of the lump sum credited against the annual child support liability, plus any remaining cash child support received.

Example:

An agreement provides for payment of a lump sum of $15,000 which is to cover 100% of the payer's child support liability. The payer's annual child support liability is $4,000. The payee's FTB is calculated on $4,000 of child support.

The lump sum is credited against 100% of the child support liability unless the agreement provides for a lesser percentage.

Example:

A child support liability is $4,000 and the child support agreement provides that the lump sum is to be credited against 75% of the child support liability. Child Support collects $500 cash child support. The FTB MIT will use $3,500 in child support, which is the $3,000 lump sum credit plus the $500 cash child support.

2.8.3.20 ACCS (temporary financial hardship) - application

Summary

This topic sets out how to apply for the

ACCS

(temporary financial hardship) and covers:

applying for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

information required when applying for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

applying for more than one child

re-applying for the same circumstance.

Applying for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

To receive ACCS (temporary financial hardship) an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must apply through Centrelink online, in person or over the phone.

Individuals can apply for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) at the same time they are completing a claim for

CCS

eligibility, or at any time where the individual is already CCS eligible.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CH(1) Determinations on own initiative or on application

Information required when applying for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

An individual needs to provide the following information in their application for ACCS (temporary financial hardship):

details about the individual making the application

details about the child/ren to whom the application relates

the requested start date and length of time (in whole weeks) that the individual believes they will be experiencing financial hardship to a maximum of 13 weeks

the circumstance/s that are causing the individual to experience temporary financial hardship

what is the circumstance that occurred - a description of what happened

when did the circumstance occur

how did that circumstance impact on the individual or family, and

required evidence to support the individual's application.

Applying for more than one child

While a determination of ACCS (temporary financial hardship) is linked to a particular child and a particular individual, if the individual has multiple children, the individual can select which children the application relates to and the application can be used to make multiple determinations (one for each child selected). It is important to note that the application for each child must be made within the 6-month period from the date the application was made.

Re-applying for the same circumstance

If the individual continues to experience financial hardship due to a temporary financial hardship circumstance, the individual can apply again for the same event if:

less than maximum of 13 weeks of ACCS (temporary financial hardship) had been granted previously, and

the date of the circumstance is still within 6 months of the date of the new (second) application.

The temporary financial hardship subsidy is paid for a maximum of 13 weeks per event. Individuals who experience multiple events of the same circumstance can lodge a separate application for each separate event.

2.8 ACCS overview

Introduction

This chapter provides an overview of the

ACCS

and its sections describe the eligibility requirements for ACCS (

1.2.7

).

ACCS

The ACCS is a top up payment to the

CCS

that provides targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care.

The ACCS will provide additional fee assistance to families and children who are genuinely disadvantaged including:

children at risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect - ACCS (child wellbeing) - a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120% of the CCS hourly rate cap (

1.1.H.20

) for up to 100 hours per fortnight and activity exempt, irrespective of the family's income (

1.1.I.20

)

grandparents on income support (

1.1.I.50

) who are the principal caregiver of their grandchildren - ACCS (grandparent) - a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120% of the CCS hourly rate cap for up to 100 hours per fortnight, and activity exempt. (

Note:

Grandparents who are principal carers and not on income support will be supported through the CCS)

families experiencing temporary financial hardship - ACCS (temporary financial hardship) - a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120% of the CCS hourly rate cap for up to 100 hours per fortnight, activity test exempt for a maximum of 13 weeks per event

low income families transitioning to work from income support - ACCS (transition to work) - a subsidy equal to 95% of the actual fee charged, up to the CCS hourly rate cap, with the hours of subsidised care based on the activity test.

The ACCS Hierarchy

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) can only be in receipt of one kind of ACCS at a time. Where an individual may be eligible for more than one kind of ACCS for a session of care (

1.1.S.40

), the individual will receive the kind of ACCS higher in the hierarchy. The ACCS hierarchy is:

ACCS (child wellbeing)

ACCS (grandparent)

ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

ACCS (transition to work).

1.1.T.60 Trust

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, a trust is an arrangement in which an individual transfers property to one or more trustees, who hold it for the benefit of one or more persons who are entitled to enforce the trust, if necessary by action in court.

Categories of trusts

There are 2 categories of trusts:

statutory trusts, and

non-statutory trusts.

Statutory trusts

Statutory trusts:

are created by law

are usually established to look after the affairs of beneficiaries of the trust who may be incapable, or legally unable to attend to their own affairs, and

exist if property is held by

public trustees

Workers Compensation Boards, and

courts.

Explanation:

Although the description of 'statutory trust' is applied, a trust in the strictest sense is not created. The Federal Court, in Flannery v Secretary of the Department of Social Security, has recognised that public trustees and similar bodies are managers rather than trustees of property.

Non-statutory trusts

The following table lists the different types of non-statutory trusts.

If a trust …

then it is …

is established with a written trust deed

Explanation:

Trust deeds do not vary the property rights of the parties to the trust until they come into effect.

an express trust, or

a declared trust.

Example:

Family trusts.

does not have a trust deed, but a court decides that it exists

a constructive trust

a resulting trust, or

an implied trust.

Ownership of non-statutory trusts

When a non-statutory trust is established the trustee becomes the legal owner of the assets held in trust, however, they are not entitled to use the assets or income for personal benefit. A trustee is bound to act in accordance with the terms that are expressed in the trust deed.

The beneficial ownership of the assets rests with the beneficiaries of the trust.

Trust deed

The majority of non-statutory trusts are expressed in a trust deed which contains the:

identity of the trustee/s

identity of the beneficiaries, and

nature of the trust.

6.4.2.40 Impact of maintenance action test on FTB reconciliation

Summary

This topic explains how the

MAT

can affect the reconciliation of

FTB

Part A.

For FTB recipients who, or whose partner, have children from a previous relationship and are entitled to more than the base rate of FTB under the income test, reconciliation must also take into consideration whether the MAT has been satisfied.

For any period during the relevant income year when the MAT is not satisfied, a recipient's entitlement to FTB Part A is restricted to the base rate (

1.1.B.10

) in respect of the child/ren for whom a maintenance entitlement exists.

The MAT is satisfied during periods where the recipient or their partner:

has a valid application with Child Support for the collection of child support

has, or is deemed to privately collect 100% of their maintenance entitlement, or

has an exemption from the MAT.

Note:

Arrangements for privately collecting child support changed on 1 July 2012. Prior to this date, if an individual did not privately collect 100% of their maintenance entitlement, they may have failed the MAT. Where an individual applies for a review of a reconciliation decision for a period prior to 1 July 2012 on the basis that they, or their partner, did not collect the full amount of their maintenance entitlement, they may have failed the MAT unless there were valid reasons for them not collecting the full amount.

From 1 July 2012, an individual privately collecting their maintenance entitlement is deemed to be receiving 100% of their maintenance entitlement and therefore passes the MAT.

1.1.E.35 Entitlement method (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, the entitlement method is the default method used to estimate the amount of maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) an instalment (

1.1.I.100

) individual receives by:

private collection (

1.1.P.130

) of a Child Support assessment (

3.1.6.40

), court order or court registered agreement (

3.1.6.30

), or

Child Support collection.

The entitlement method assumes that the individual is receiving the amount of maintenance that has been assessed by Child Support, or is contained in the court order or court registered agreement unless the individual advises otherwise.

The entitlement method is based on the amount of maintenance the individual is entitled to receive.

1.2.7 Additional child care subsidy (ACCS) - description

Objectives of

ACCS

ACCS aims to assist families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable early childhood education and care by providing additional fee assistance to families and children in need.

Types of ACCS

There are 4 types of ACCS:

ACCS (child wellbeing) (

2.8.1

) for children at risk of serious abuse or neglect

ACCS (grandparent) (

2.8.2

) for grandparents on income support (

1.1.I.50

) who are the principle carer of their grandchildren

ACCS (temporary financial hardship) (

2.8.3)

for families experiencing temporary significant financial hardship

ACCS (transition to work) (

2.8.4

) for families transitioning from income support to work.

ACCS eligibility

Eligibility for ACCS is determined in relation to each session of care (

1.1.S.40

) delivered by an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

).

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) is eligible for ACCS for a session of care provided by an approved child care service to a child if, at the time the session is provided:

the individual meets the eligibility criteria for

CCS

, and

the individual (or child in the case of ACCS (child wellbeing)) meets the eligibility criteria for one type of ACCS.

An approved provider is eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing) under a Provider Eligible Arrangement (

4.13.2.40

) if they meet the eligibility criteria.

ACCS entitlement

The amount of ACCS an individual is entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to is dependent upon the type of ACCS they are eligible for.

The table below shows the general number of hours subsidised and amount of subsidy available for each type of ACCS. More hours or a higher rate may be available in exceptional circumstances (

3.5.5

).

3.1.6.80 Changing the method of collection

Changing from private collection (

1.1.P.130

) to agency collection

When changing collection methods, a payee can request that Services Australia collect arrears of child support amounts that were unpaid during the previous period of private collection. Services Australia can collect arrears of up to 3 months, or up to 9 months in exceptional circumstances. Arrears in excess of this can only be collected privately by the payee.

Note:

Child Support decides what constitutes exceptional circumstances.

From 1 July 2012, if a deemed amount of child support is included in the

FTB

MIT

for a payee privately collecting less than their full child support entitlement, and the payee swaps to agency collect, the use of the deemed amount ceases on the day from which agency collection applies. This includes an earlier period of unpaid private collect arrears that are able to be collected by Services Australia (generally limited to 3 months). The actual amount collected by Services Australia will then be included in the MIT when received. Any arrears privately collected in future that relate to the deemed period are excluded from FTB calculations to prevent double counting.

Changing from agency collection to private collection

The payee (or the payee and payer jointly) can elect to opt out of agency collection. In certain circumstances, the Child Support Registrar can also make a case private collect. A payer cannot elect to opt out of agency collection without the payee’s consent.

When a payee (or payer and payee jointly) opts out of agency collection, they can also elect for Services Australia not to collect any unpaid amounts (arrears).

When a payee (or the payee and payer jointly) changes from agency collection to private collection, they are not ending the child support assessment, they are simply stopping collection by Services Australia.

Services Australia decides whether the payee is eligible to change from agency collection to private collection. The payee may lodge an objection with Services Australia against a decision not to allow them to change to private collection.

Act reference:

1.1.C.70 Custody order, court order (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, a custody order is a document issued by the then Family Court of Australia before the 1996 changes, which sets out the terms and conditions of who has custody of a child. Custody was defined in the

Family Law Act 1975

as being:

the right to have the daily care and control of the child, and

the right and responsibility to make decisions concerning the daily care and control of the child.

Custody orders were issued by the Family Law Court before 11 June 1996, and are still valid despite the reforms to the Family Law Act. From June 1996, custody orders were replaced by registered parenting plans (

1.1.P.21

) or parenting orders (

1.1.P.19

). From 2003, the requirement to register parenting plans was removed.

A person who has custody of a child is taken to have legal responsibility (

1.1.L.20

) for the child.

Interpreting a court order

If the court order does not assign custody to a particular person, it can be deemed that both parents have joint legal responsibility.

Variations to an original court order can be made as separate orders in addition to the original, or may replace the original. Unless the new order replaces all previous orders, all of the orders should be obtained and read in conjunction with each other.

3.1.5.55 Reasonable maintenance action completed - private collect

Summary

This topic provides information about satisfying the

MAT

(

3.1.5

) in the context of private collection of maintenance (

1.1.M.10

). Topics discussed include:

maintenance action completed

taking effective action to collect arrears of maintenance

partial exemptions from the maintenance action test, and

non-payment of child support arrears following a retrospective reassessment of child support.

This topic does not discuss notional assessments. Please refer to topics

1.1.N.45

and

3.1.7.14

for discussion of notional assessments.

For guidance on collection of maintenance from a payer who is a resident overseas, refer to

3.1.5.80

.

Maintenance action completed

Maintenance action has been completed when the individual:

has a registered child support assessment with Child Support (

3.1.5.50

)

has a registered child support agreement with Child Support, or

has taken appropriate court action in a reciprocating jurisdiction to obtain maintenance.

For guidance on whether maintenance action has been completed where an individual has a child support agreement in relation to which there is a notional assessment, refer to

3.1.7.14

.

Individuals privately collecting child support

Individuals who are privately collecting child support are deemed to have received the full child support entitlement for the purposes of the maintenance income test (MIT) (

3.1.7

) if it is reasonable for the individual to take action to collect their full entitlement. The deemed amount still applies even if the amount collected by the payee is more or less than the entitlement.

Example:

Since 2009 Tracey has a private collect child support entitlement of $10,000 per financial year. In 2012-13 Tracey collected $10,500 in child support payments. As Tracey is collecting their child support privately, they are deemed to have received $10,000, which is applied to the MIT. If the $500 is related to arrears from a period before 1 July 2012, this amount would be included as part of the MIT.

Prior to 1 July 2012, an individual who chose to collect their child support privately was assumed to be collecting 100% of their child support assessment or registered agreement. The amount of the assessment or agreement was taken to be the received amount and used when applying the MIT, unless the individual advised the Secretary otherwise. Where the amount received was less than the assessed amount, the individual was considered to have failed the MAT.

3.1.6.70

Child support collection

Taking effective action to privately collect arrears of maintenance

From 1 July 2012, an individual who has not privately collected 100% of their assessed amount of child support is deemed to receive their full child support entitlement for the MIT, if it is reasonable for the individual to collect their full entitlement.

If the individual is deemed to receive their full entitlement but actually receives less than their full entitlement, any arrears received that relate to the deemed period are not counted when they are actually received. This is because they have already been deemed to have been received in the income year to which they relate.

Example:

Amanda has a child support entitlement of $5,000 for both 2022-23 and 2023-24. Amanda advises the Secretary that they received only $4,000 in 2022-23. However, it is determined that it is reasonable for Amanda to take action to collect their full entitlement and therefore it is deemed that Amanda has received $5,000 for 2022-23. During 2023-24, Amanda advises the Secretary that they have privately collected the $1,000 outstanding from 2022-23. This $1,000 arrears from 2022-23 is not counted as maintenance income for 2023-24 as it has already been included in the deemed amount for 2022-23. The Secretary deems that Amanda received $5,000 in 2022-23 and $5,000 in 2023-24 for the MIT and Amanda does not fail the MAT.

However, privately collected arrears of child support that relate to a period that a deemed amount did not apply will be included in the MIT when they are received. This includes privately collected child support arrears relating to a period before 1 July 2012.

Example:

Justine was privately collecting from 2009-10 until December 2012 and has $13,000 of outstanding arrears from the payer from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2012. In October 2012 Justine was successful in obtaining $6,000 of the $13,000 in arrears. As the arrears amount applies to a non-deemed period, Centrelink will determine that Justine has received $6,000 in addition to their full child support entitlement in 2012-13.

In some cases, a full or partial exemption from the MAT (

3.1.5.70

) may be granted, which may affect the amount of maintenance included in the MIT, depending on the amount that is privately collected.

Non-payment of child support arrears following a retrospective reassessment of child support - for periods post 1 July 2012

If, following a retrospective reassessment of child support, the individual advises that the liable parent is not going to pay the arrears owed, the individual should be advised that it may be in their interest to seek legal advice about enforcing the payment. If there are special reasons that make it unreasonable for the individual to collect the arrears, Centrelink can consider whether a retrospective partial exemption from the MAT would be appropriate.

If a retrospective assessment affects a past period where a deemed amount applied, FTB entitlements for that past period will be recalculated using the entitlement amount for that period as varied by the retrospective assessment.

However, where the individual had a partial exemption and was collecting less than their full entitlement, child support arrears that become payable for a past period as a result of the retrospective assessment will be counted in the year that they are actually received.

Non-payment of child support arrears following a retrospective reassessment of child support - for periods pre 1 July 2012

If, following a retrospective reassessment of child support, the individual advises that the liable parent is not going to pay the arrears owed:

the unpaid arrears are to be taken out of the FTB assessment

the individual should be advised that it may be in their interest to seek legal advice about enforcing the payment, and

if payment is later made, the individual must notify the Secretary.

For MAT purposes, the individual will continue to satisfy the requirements as long as they are collecting 100% of their ongoing entitlement.

For all periods, the individual is not required to transfer to Child Support collect. However, if the arrears relate to an immediate past period, the individual can opt-in to Child Support collection to have the Registrar collect up to 3 months arrears on their behalf.

Explanation:

An individual who privately collects child support is not required to take court action to collect arrears from a retrospective reassessment to satisfy the MAT. If the individual transferred from private collect to Child Support collect, the Registrar generally could only collect any child support liability not met for the period 3 months immediately prior to the transfer.

For retrospective reassessment cases, this means that the Registrar cannot assist with any child support arrears that were incurred during periods prior to the 3 month limitation (unless exceptional circumstances apply). In practical terms, this means that the Registrar is not in a position to collect any of the arrears for private collect individuals whose child support assessment is retrospective increased.

4.3.5 Lump sum payments

Past period claim

A person making a past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) for

FTB

will be paid by direct credit unless the Secretary directs that the relevant amount is to be paid in a different way, other than by direct payment into an account. Payment by direct credit should be encouraged, however, there is no legislative restriction imposed when a person makes a past period claim.

Explanation:

This is in contrast to instalment claims where bank account details for direct credit are required before the claim can be determined, unless an exemption is granted.

Combination of instalment & past period claim

If the person is making a claim for instalments (

1.1.I.100

) and a past period at the same time, the lump sum for the past period is paid by direct credit unless an exemption is granted.

Explanation:

The individual is required to provide bank account details for the instalment claim. The claims are treated as one claim and determined together.

1.1.A.55 Advance assessment day (FTB advance)

Definition

Where an individual makes a request for an

FTB

advance, their advance assessment day is the day the Secretary determines their entitlement to the FTB advance (

1.2.8

).

For the first advance paid as a regular FTB advance, the advance assessment day depends on when the individual requests that the Secretary determines their advance. An individual may request that their first regular advance be determined at a specified future date, which may generally be up to 182 days (26 weeks) in the future.

If an individual has previously been paid a regular FTB advance and has not withdrawn the request, the advance assessment day is the day after the end of the last of the intervals of 182 days of their existing regular advance.

2.6.4 CCS eligibility - death of an eligible child or recipient

Death of an eligible child

CCS

and

ACCS

payments cease following the death of a child, as no further sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) can be provided, therefore an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is no longer entitled to CCS or ACCS amounts (and an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) is no longer entitled to ACCS (child wellbeing) if applicable). CCS and ACCS is not payable as an absence (

1.1.A.05

) once a child has permanently ceased attending the service (in this situation because the child has died).

The approved provider is required to update the enrolment notice (

1.1.E.25

) with an end date (being the day after the child last physically attended a session of care), as the arrangement for care with the individual has ceased.

If the deceased child is the only child for which an individual is receiving CCS or ACCS, the individual ceases to be eligible for CCS or ACCS and a notification is sent to the individual.

A final payment is made to the approved provider in respect of the deceased child at the first payment following their death (or notification of death, if payment made prior to the death of the child). If CCS or ACCS has been paid in respect of sessions of care that are no longer eligible as a result of a child's death, an approved provider debt (

1.1.D.60

) is raised.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 67FB Notice of change of circumstances: individuals, section 200D Notice of change in circumstances—providers

Payment in substitution for someone who has died

An individual may make a claim (

1.1.C.27

) in respect of a child for CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died. If an individual is entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to be paid such an amount, it is paid directly to the substitute individual.

Where individuals make a claim for CCS or ACCS in substitution for an individual who has died and are found to be entitled to be paid unpaid amounts for a deceased individual, these are intended to be 'one off' payments in respect of unpaid entitlement for past sessions of care (that is, not an ongoing claim in respect of the child).

If the individual wants to receive CCS or ACCS by fee reduction on an 'ongoing' basis for the child whose parent (

1.1.P.10

)/guardian has died, they will need to make a new claim.

The deceased individual must have been eligible for CCS or ACCS for the sessions of care. Therefore, the subsidy rate and hours subsidised per fortnight (based on the deceased individual's estimated income/participation level) that is applicable for the sessions of care which have already been submitted, but not yet paid, are to be used in the calculation for the amount being claimed by the substitute individual.

Individuals who are eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing), ACCS (temporary financial hardship) and ACCS (grandparent) are exempt from reporting recognised participation details. Individuals eligible for these ACCS types will automatically be entitled to up to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.

Individuals will still be required to provide information on their participation:

to determine the number of subsidised hours for children not covered by ACCS, or

in case they need to access CCS once their certificate or determination finishes.

If an individual has been receiving ACCS (child wellbeing) for 6 months or more they will not be required to report their recognised participation for a further 18 months for the child, once ACCS (child wellbeing) has ceased.

Individuals eligible for the ACCS (transition to work) will need to report their hours of recognised participation.

Recognised participation types for CCS

The following participation types are recognised for an increased hours result of 100 hours:

Recognised participation types

Considerations

Paid work

Includes hours of paid work as an employee and/or self-employed.

Individuals whose hours of paid work vary unpredictably from fortnight to fortnight can estimate their participation over a 3-month period (see reporting hours of participation below).

Includes periods of paid leave such as parental leave, annual leave, long service leave, leave for illness or injury, or carer's leave.

Individuals on paid leave will have their leave recognised for the same number of hours per fortnight as they worked immediately prior to being on leave.

Example:

If an individual was working 50 hours per fortnight immediately before their leave, they would (continue to) have a subsidised hours result of 100 hours per fortnight while on leave.

Individuals who are self-employed and taking paid parental leave will only have this leave recognised if their business continues to operate and they have an intention to resume work in their business in the foreseeable future.

Unpaid leave

Individuals on unpaid leave will have their leave recognised for the same number of hours per fortnight as they worked immediately prior to being on leave.

Example:

If an individual was working 60 hours per fortnight immediately before their leave, they would (continue to) have a subsidised hours result of 100 hours per fortnight while on leave.

Unpaid leave is recognised for a maximum of 6 months continuous period, except for unpaid parental leave which is not time limited.

Individuals who are self-employed and taking unpaid parental leave will only have this leave recognised if their business continues to operate and they have an intention to resume work in their business in the foreseeable future.

Individuals working from contract to contract or casually for a regular employer (or an employment agency) would also have their unpaid parental leave recognised if they intend to resume work after the period of leave.

Approved course of education or study

The individual must be enrolled in, and actively working towards completing, a secondary or tertiary course of education or study. The list of approved secondary and tertiary courses is as per SSAct section 541B, which is explained in SS Guide

1.1.A.210

.

Includes contact hours and self-directed hours of study.

Practicums or vocational placements are included.

Includes term/semester breaks but excludes the term/semester break following completion of the course.

Breaks that arise because the individual defers starting or continuing the course of education or study are not included.

Training to improve work skills and/or employment prospects

Includes contact hours and self-directed hours of study.

Practicums or vocational placements are included.

Includes term/semester breaks but excludes the term/semester break following completion of the course.

Breaks that arise because the individual defers starting or continuing the training course are not included.

Voluntary work

Includes voluntary work:

that improves work skills, employment prospects (or both)

for a charitable, welfare or community organisation

at a school, preschool or

CBDC

service.

If voluntary work is the only participation type being undertaken, the individual will be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as only the first 16 hours of voluntary work will be recognised per fortnight. To access further hours of subsidised approved child care the individual would need to combine their hours of voluntary work with one or more of the other recognised participation types and these must total more than 48 hours per fortnight combined.

Example:

An individual undertaking 20 hours of voluntary work per fortnight and no other recognised participation would be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as voluntary work is the only participation undertaken.

Unpaid work experience or unpaid internship

Must not be work that would otherwise be undertaken by a paid employee.

Must provide the individual with a meaningful learning experience, training or skill development.

Must not be undertaken as a requirement for a course of education or study.

Explanation:

These placements should be recorded as hours of participating in an approved course of education or study or training to improve work skills and/or employment prospects.

Unpaid work for a family business owned by an immediate family member

Each of the following is considered a member of the individual's immediate family:

a parent of the individual

a partner of a parent of the individual

a partner of the individual

a sibling of the individual, including any person (other than the individual) who is a child of a parent of the individual

a child of the individual

a partner of a child of the individual

another particular member of the individual's family determined by the Secretary to be a member of the individual's immediate family for the purpose of this participation type.

Each of the following is a child of the other person:

an adopted child, or step-child of the other person, within the meaning of the SSAct section 1207A

a foster-child or ward of the other person, including someone who was the ward of the other person when the ward was under 18 years of age

someone who is a child of the other person within the meaning of the

Family Law Act 1975

section 65A.

Actively looking for work

An individual is actively looking for work if they engage in one or more of the following during the fortnight:

looking for job vacancies

preparing résumés and job applications

contacting potential employers

preparing for, and attending, job interviews.

Includes individuals who are employed but looking for additional work or more permanent work (for example, casual workers seeking a permanent job).

If actively looking for work is the only participation type being undertaken, the individual will be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as only the first 16 hours of actively looking for work will be recognised per fortnight. To be entitled to further hours of subsidised approved child care the individual would need to combine their hours of actively looking for work with one or more of the other recognised participation types and these must total more than 48 hours per fortnight combined.

Example:

An individual who is actively looking for work for 20 hours per fortnight and not undertaking any other recognised participation would be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as actively looking for work is the only participation type undertaken.

Actively setting up a business

The individual must engage in one or more of the following in relation to the proposed business:

obtaining finance, advice and support

attending and organising events, including meetings, networks and seminars

developing business, marketing or other plans.

Actively setting up a business will only be recognised for a maximum of 13 fortnights in every 12 months.

The participation does not need to be reported consecutively within the 12 months and may apply to more than one business.

Recognised participation types combined with other activity

In certain circumstances, recognised participation types may be combined with hours spent on other specified activities, to contribute toward an increased hours result.

SpB

or

PP

with a compulsory mutual obligation requirement

Recipients (

1.1.R.07

) with a compulsory mutual obligation requirement will automatically be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as the basic subsidy amount.

Recipients may combine their hours spent meeting their compulsory mutual obligation requirements with hours of recognised participation to achieve an increased hours result. If the combined hours of time spent on meeting mutual obligations and recognised participation total over 48 hours per fortnight, the individual will be eligible for a subsidised hours result of 100 hours.

Example:

An individual in receipt of JSP is spending 20 hours per fortnight attending interviews, approaching employers and writing applications to meet their compulsory mutual obligation requirements. This individual would be entitled to the basic subsidy amount of 72 hours per fortnight. In addition to the requirements in their job plan, this individual begins volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight with a local charity. Their 20 hours per fortnight to meet their mutual obligation requirements combined with 30 hours of unpaid voluntary work mean their hours of activity is 50 hours per fortnight, entitling them to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.

Carer allowance

CA

recipients will automatically be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight as the basic subsidy amount.

CA recipients may combine their hours spent caring for another person with hours of recognised participation to achieve an increased hours result. If the combined hours of time spent on caring activity and recognised participation total over 48 hours per fortnight, the individual will be eligible for a subsidised hours result of 100 hours.

Other participation

If an individual undertakes another type of participation (not listed above) that would maintain or improve work skills or employment prospects (or both), they can make an application to Centrelink to have these hours of participation recognised for the purpose of the subsidised hours result.

CCS - other recognised participation types

Reporting hours of participation

The following paragraphs explain how individuals should report the number of hours of recognised participation they undertake each fortnight.

Hours of participation do not need to coincide with child care hours

When declaring participation hours for CCS, the participation hours do not need to coincide with child care hours. For example, an individual undertaking work on the weekends will be entitled to CCS during the week.

Combining participation

Individuals can combine recognised participation and the individual's subsidised hours result is determined by counting all the hours of recognised participation undertaken in a fortnight.

Example:

Jane does paid work for 25 hours per fortnight, volunteers at her child's school for 16 hours per fortnight and does unpaid work in her family's business for 8 hours per fortnight. Jane's participation would be a combined total of 49 hours per fortnight, which would entitle her to 100 hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight.

Reasonable travel time

To support the various distances families need to travel for child care, individuals can include reasonable travel time when declaring their hours of participation. This is the time taken travelling from the approved child care service to the place where they do the participation and travel from this place back to the child care service.

Travel time where the child is in the care of the individual should not be included when reporting hours of participation, this means:

travel from home to the child care service to drop the child off, and

travel time from the service to home or other locations after collecting the child.

To inform consideration of reasonable travel time, individuals should consider how long it takes to reach their place of work or other participation type directly from the child care service, and vice versa. Travel time can include travel via a car, bicycle, public transport and/or walking where appropriate.

If the place of work or other participation varies day-to-day, individuals should take this into account when estimating total travel time on a fortnightly basis.

Example:

Nadia is a single parent who lives in Western Sydney and works 7 hours a day in a financial services office near the Sydney CBD. Nadia's son Jason attends an early childhood education and care (ECEC) service close to the family home. After she drops Jason at the service, it takes Nadia one hour to drive directly to her workplace and one hour to return. Nadia bases her participation estimate on 9 hours per day - 7 hours of work and 2 hours of travel.

Example:

Kate works as a beauty therapist for 6 hours a day in Canberra. Her son Cale attends a ECEC service near the family home. After dropping off her son at the service, Kate has a 30 minute drive to the salon. After finishing her shift, she goes to the gym for an hour-long workout before returning to the service to collect her son. Kate's participation estimate of 7 hours per day includes her hours of work and her 30-minute travel time to and from the service - 6 hours of work and one hour of travel. Kate's travel time estimate, however, cannot include her hour at the gym.

Timing of entitlement to increased hours result

Individuals notifying Centrelink of a change in their participation that will entitle them to an increased hours result will have their increased hours result apply from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight.

Paid work that varies unpredictably

An individual whose hours of paid work vary unpredictably from fortnight to fortnight (such as those in casual employment) can estimate the highest number of hours they expect to work in a single fortnight over a 3‑month period. This estimate will be used to determine their hours of subsidised approved child care per fortnight. Estimating hours on this basis will not be needed by workers with a consistent number of fortnightly hours (who will be required to report their actual hours of activity), and this approach can only be applied to report unpredictable hours of paid work (not for other types of recognised participation).

Example:

Suzie is a single parent working at a supermarket. Her hours per fortnight can vary from 15 (2 shifts per fortnight) to 60 (8 shifts per fortnight). Occasionally she can also be called in to work at short notice for extra shifts if they are short staffed on the day.

Suzie's working hours across 6 fortnights range from 15 hours to 60 hours per fortnight - this would ordinarily give her a subsidised hours result of 72 hours, depending on the hours she worked in that fortnight.

To support her estimated maximum hours of paid work with access to sufficient hours of subsidised approved child care, Suzie would declare an estimate of 60 hours of paid work per fortnight and would be entitled to 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight .

Example:

Milli works 2 casual jobs in the fast food industry. Her total hours can vary significantly across fortnights - in some fortnights she may not work at all, while in others she can be assigned up to 5 four hour shifts.

Milli's working hours across 6 fortnights range from 0 hours to 20 hours per fortnight. As Milli’s hours are below 48 hours per fortnight, Milli would not be required to report her participation and would automatically be entitled to 72 hours of subsidised child care in each fortnight.

Individuals who estimate participation in this way will need to notify Centrelink of a change where their level of participation, estimated over 3 months, would cause their subsidised hours result to change. This would include, for example, where the individual stopped working altogether or where the basis of their 3-month estimate has changed and needs to be updated. In the first example, if Suzie moved to a permanent arrangement of two 7.5 hour shifts per fortnight (15 hours of paid work per fortnight), she should notify Centrelink as this would result in her subsidised hours result changing from 100 hours to 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.

Evidentiary requirements

Individuals self-declare participation to Centrelink and generally evidence is not required at the time of claim or when updating their participation information. Centrelink will ask some individuals to provide evidence as part of their normal random spot checks.

Evidence could include, a copy of a payslip or a letter from the organisation where the individual is a volunteer.

Change in participation

When an individual (or their partner) experiences a change in participation that would affect their entitlement, they are required to notify Centrelink as soon as possible.

If an individual reports a change in participation in advance of the change occurring, the new subsidised hours result will take effect from the beginning of the CCS fortnight after the change occurred.

If the individual reports a change in participation after the change occurred, the change will take effect from the beginning of the CCS fortnight after the change was notified.

If the change in subsidised hours result is beneficial to the individual (for example, it caused the individual to be entitled to an increased hours result of 100 hours) a review will be conducted, but the increased hours result will only be applied for a maximum of 28 days prior to the change being reported to Centrelink.

If the change is not beneficial to the individual, for example, it caused the individual to move from 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight to 72 hours, a review will be conducted, and the lower result will be applied as far back as the change occurred. That is, if the individual reports the change 6 months late they may incur a debt in relation to payments already calculated and made on the basis that they had access to more hours of subsidised care than they were in fact entitled to, for that whole period.

4.1.1.40 TFN requirements for non-residents

Summary

This topic contains information for individuals (

1.1.I.90

) who wish to lodge a claim for

FTB

and whose partner is not residing in Australia.

To make an effective claim for FTB, an individual must supply their

TFN

and the TFN of their partner (

1.1.P.30

), if they have one. Where their partner is not residing in Australia, they may not have a TFN. Non-residents of Australia who do not have a TFN must apply for one by completing the 'TFN - application or enquiry for individuals living outside Australia' (NAT2628). The

ATO

will give priority to an individual and their partner if a TFN is required for FTB purposes.

Declining to provide a TFN statement is not an offence, but the applicant's FTB claim may not be effective or their FTB payment may cease to be payable if a TFN statement is not provided.

3.1.6.55 Child support case ended - payer not a parent of the child

Background

Where a payer (

1.1.P.72

) is found not to be a parent of a child it may impact on both the payee (

1.1.P.71

) and payer. The payee's

FTB

Part A entitlement may be affected if they are entitled to receive more than the base rate of FTB. The payer's (or their current partner's) entitlement may be affected if they have received FTB for part or all of the same period.

The payer may no longer be considered a parent of a child in respect of whom maintenance was paid in the following circumstances:

where a court decision under the CSA Act section 107 is made. Where this decision is made it is decreed that the Child Support Registrar has never accepted the original child support application. The court may or may not require the payee to repay the money they received for the subject child, or

the payee elects to end their child support assessment under the CSA Act section 151 because of evidence which suggests that the payer is not a parent of a child (for example, DNA test). Instead of forcing the payer to take the matter to court, the payee can elect to end the child support case. They may request to end their case from a specified day, which must be a day after the election to end the assessment is made.

Act reference:

CSA Act

section 107 Declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, section 151 Election to end administrative assessment

Effect on the payee's entitlement to FTB

Where a court decision under the CSA Act section 107 is made, this effectively removes the payer's liability to pay child support. However, the amount of child support paid may still be considered maintenance income if the payer is a partner or former partner of a parent of the child (owing to the legislative definition of maintenance income in the FA Act).

If a child support case is retrospectively ended or retrospectively made invalid because the payer is no longer considered to be a parent of the child, consideration needs to be given to whether the payer is considered to be a partner or former partner of a parent of the child and whether the payee has to repay the money.

If the payer is not a partner or former partner, the amounts paid are not considered maintenance income and should be removed from the

MIT

(even if the payee is not required to repay any money). The effect of this is that the payee may have been paid a reduced rate of FTB and, therefore, may be entitled to a top-up of FTB for all income years for which child support payments had previously been assessed.

If the payer is a partner or former partner and a court decision under section 143 is made (because of a decision under section 107), which requires the payee to repay the money, the payee will incur a child support overpayment. In this situation, the child support payments paid to the payee cannot be considered as maintenance income for FTB purposes and should be removed from the MIT. The effect of this is that the payee may have been paid a reduced rate of FTB and, therefore, may be entitled to a top-up of FTB for all income years for which child support payments had previously been assessed.

If the payer is a partner or former partner and the payee is not required to repay any of the money to the payer, the amounts received should be considered as maintenance income and assessed under the MIT (unless or until such a time as the money is repaid).

Where either a decision is made under section 107, or the payee elects to end their assessment, the payee should be granted another period of grace to commence reasonable maintenance action of at least 14 days and no more than 28 days from the date of the court decision under section 107 or the date the payee elects to end the child support assessment. If the other parent is known, generally the payee must apply for a child support assessment against the other parent to continue to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A. This may involve taking legal action to prove parentage. If the other parent is not known or the payee has not been successful in proving paternity, they may apply for an exemption from the

MAT

.

Electing to end an assessment

Effect on the payer's entitlement to FTB

Where the payer is found not to be the parent, the amounts paid can no longer be classed as

DCME

. For re-reconciliation to occur, an amended

ATI

must be provided, the result of which will be either a nil result or an FTB overpayment.

Given the nature and outcome of these cases for the payer, in some circumstances it may be appropriate to waive the overpayment. The following guidelines apply to determine whether or not the payer should repay the FTB overpayment.

Court ruling

Decision

Court orders repayment of the child support to the payer.

The FTB overpayment is raised.

Court deems that child maintenance does not need to be repaid because to do so would be detrimental to the welfare of the child.

The FTB overpayment is not raised.

The court orders repayment of the child support but, for example, over such a protracted period of time that the payments would have an insignificant financial impact on the payer.

The FTB overpayment is not raised.

1.1.D.65 Defence Force Income Support Allowance

Definition

DFISA

is paid by

DVA

.

DFISA may be payable if:

the individual or their partner receive an

ADP

from DVA

one of them receives or is qualified for a social security pension or benefit, and

their rate of social security pension or benefit is reduced (including reduced to nil) by the inclusion of the DVA ADP in the income test.

The amount of DFISA paid equals the difference between the rate of social security income support payment and the rate of payment the individual would receive if the DVA adjusted disability pension was exempt from the income test but included for

RA

calculations. DFISA is either taxable income or a tax-free pension or benefit within the definition of 'adjusted taxable income' under the family assistance law.

From 1 January 2022, DFISA was discontinued. Where a DFISA payment is made retrospectively for a period prior to 1 January 2022, it would be counted as adjusted taxable income against the income year for which it was received.

1.1.I.82 Indexation factor

Note:

The term 'indexation factor' is used in both indexation based on

CPI

as well as in calculating indexed incomes (estimate or actual) based on average weekly earnings (AWE).

Definition: Indexation factor - indexed incomes

An indexation factor is used to calculate the indexed estimate or indexed actual income that may be used to establish the

FTB

payment rate where an instalment determination is in force.

Determining the indexation factor

The indexation factor is determined by dividing the AWE for the reference period in the most recent November by the AWE for the reference period in the highest previous November. If the 4th decimal place of the quotient is greater than 4, then round the 3rd decimal place up by 0.001 and express the quotient to 3 decimal places. If the 4th decimal place is not greater than 4, leave the quotient as calculated to 3 decimal places. The indexation factor is the greater of either 1 or the quotient rounded to 3 decimal places.

Example 1:

The number 1.32739 has a 4th decimal place that is less than 4. As a result the indexation factor is the greater of 1 or this number calculated to 3 decimal places, which is 1.327. If the original number was 1.32754 the 4th decimal place would be greater than 4 and thus the indexation factor would be 1.328.

Example 2:

For the financial year 2014-15:

AWE for the reference period in the most recent November (November 2013) = $1,114.20

AWE for the reference period in the highest previous November (November 2012) = $1,081.30

Indexation factor = November 2013 ÷ November 2012

= 1,114.20 ÷ 1,081.30

= 1.0304263

3.1.5.30 Taking reasonable maintenance action

Summary

This topic provides information about:

who is required to take reasonable maintenance action

taking reasonable action for maintenance (

1.1.M.10

)

the amount of time the individual has to take action before they fail to meet the

MAT

maladministration by Centrelink

where an individual applies for an exemption

where reasonable maintenance is not taken, and

consequences of not taking reasonable maintenance action.

Who is required to take reasonable maintenance action

An individual is required to take reasonable maintenance action for a child if they are entitled to apply for maintenance (

3.1.5.25

) for the child and Centrelink considers that it is reasonable that they should take this action. This requirement also applies to the individual's current partner (

1.1.P.30

) if the partner is entitled to apply for maintenance for the child. If the individual or their partner does not meet this requirement, only the base rate (

1.1.B.15

) of

FTB

Part A is payable in respect of the child and the child is not included for

RA

purposes.

Individuals who are entitled to receive child support and have a senior secondary school child turning 18 are required to take reasonable action to obtain an extension of their child support assessment (

3.1.5.40

).

If an individual is the payer in a child support assessment or agreement for a child, there generally will not be a requirement for the individual to take action to obtain maintenance for that child as they have already met the MAT requirement by being the payer.

For information about situations where Centrelink may consider that it is not reasonable for an individual to take maintenance action, refer to

3.1.5.70

.

Taking reasonable maintenance action

To take reasonable maintenance action, an individual generally needs to do one of the following:

apply for a child support assessment with Child Support

apply to Child Support for the acceptance of a child support agreement, or

take reasonable action to change from being the payer under a child support agreement to being the payee for a child whom the individual has more than 65% care.

If an individual has one of the above actions in progress, they meet the MAT during the period of time their action is still in progress. Further steps to complete maintenance action may be required (refer to policy reference below).

Where the paying parent is overseas and in a reciprocating jurisdiction, the individual will generally be able to apply for a child support assessment. However, in some circumstances it may be appropriate for the individual to obtain maintenance from the overseas jurisdiction, which may satisfy the MAT, depending on the circumstances of the case. For more information see topic

Australia's international maintenance arrangements

Period of grace to take maintenance action

Instalment (

1.1.I.100

) and past period (

1.1.P.60

) individuals have 13 weeks to take reasonable action to obtain maintenance for a child. After 13 weeks, if the MAT is not met, the individual will be paid the base rate of FTB Part A for the child. The 13-week period begins when the individual first becomes entitled to claim or apply for maintenance for the child. The 13-week period would therefore apply from the later of:

the

DOB

of the FTB child

the date of separation from the child's other parent

the date the child came into the individual's care

the date the individual's percentage of care increases to 35% or more, or

such later date that the individual first becomes entitled to claim or apply for maintenance.

Example:

Daniel is in receipt of FTB for their 2 children. Daniel and the mother of the children, Tegan, separate. Following their separation Daniel has shared care and remains entitled to FTB for the 2 children. Daniel has 13 weeks from the date they separated from Tegan to take reasonable maintenance action. During the 13-week period, Daniel is in receipt of their full entitlement of FTB Part A. The 13 weeks end and Daniel has not taken reasonable maintenance action. As a result, Daniel's FTB Part A rate is reduced to the base rate for both children.

Where an individual becomes eligible for FTB after they became entitled to claim or apply for maintenance, a reduced or no grace period may apply if Centrelink considers that it is reasonable for the individual to take maintenance action prior to the date they became entitled to FTB. Similarly, where an individual lodges a past period claim for FTB after they became entitled to apply for maintenance, some or all of their grace period may have already elapsed. In these situations, eligibility for an exemption from the MAT and the length of the exemption would depend on the circumstances of the case.

Example:

Jane enters into a relationship with Terry and gives birth to a child of that relationship. Jane is not entitled to FTB due to a high combined income. Four years later, Jane separates from Terry and moves interstate with the child, having been offered employment. Terry moves overseas following their separation to a country that has a reciprocal child support arrangement with Australia, which allows Jane to seek maintenance from Terry. However, Jane decides not to claim or apply for maintenance from Terry. Jane also decides not to claim FTB immediately after their separation, as their anticipated income will be too high and they believe they will not be eligible for FTB. However, Jane's new employment contract is subsequently withdrawn, and they claim FTB 10 weeks after the separation. As Jane has been entitled to apply for maintenance from Terry and has not done so since their separation, they only have 3 weeks remaining to take reasonable action to obtain maintenance, without their FTB Part A rate being reduced to the base rate.

Additionally, if certain circumstances exist that are outside an individual's control making it unreasonable for the individual to take maintenance action within the 13-week grace period, the period may be extended or an exemption from the MAT may be applied. The circumstances must be assessed on a case by case basis and the grace period or exemption can only be extended up to the date which it would no longer be considered unreasonable for the individual to take maintenance action.

Maladministration by Centrelink

If Centrelink subsequently becomes aware that an individual was entitled to claim or apply for maintenance from an earlier date but had not applied at the time, and an exemption (for example, fear of violence) was not appropriate, an FTB Part A debt may arise due to the individual not taking reasonable maintenance action. However, where an individual did not take maintenance action (even though they were entitled to do so) because of maladministration by Centrelink (for example, Centrelink provided incorrect information that caused the individual to not apply for maintenance for an earlier period), the individual's failure to take action could be considered 'reasonable' in the circumstances. Centrelink should consider each case individually and decide whether the individual's inaction was reasonable in the circumstances. If Centrelink decides that the individual's inaction was reasonable:

the individual should be assessed as being exempt from the MAT for the earlier period, and

from the time the maladministration is corrected, there would be a grace period of at least 14 days and no more than 28 days, to take reasonable maintenance action before the child's FTB Part A is reduced to the base rate.

Application for exemption

If an individual receiving FTB by instalments applies for an exemption from the requirement to take reasonable action, they are taken to be satisfying the MAT until a decision is made.

If the request for an exemption is refused and the 13-week grace period has ended, the individual has a further 14 days from the date they are advised of the decision to take reasonable maintenance action.

If the individual fails to attend an interview relating to their request for an exemption, their rate of FTB Part A must be reduced to the base rate from the end of the 13-week grace period.

Where an individual who claims FTB for a past period requests an exemption from the requirement to take maintenance action, an exemption may be granted and backdated depending on the circumstances of the case.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.70

Exemptions from the maintenance action test,

3.1.5.90

Maintenance action test reviews

Reasonable maintenance action not taken

Reasonable action to obtain maintenance has not been taken for a child if the individual has chosen not to:

lodge an application for child support

take action to establish parentage of the child where it is considered reasonable to do so

continue with an application for child support by withdrawing the application before the assessment is completed

provide information to Child Support that is reasonable for them to provide, and Child Support rejects their application for child support or the application is not completed

obtain an extension to their child support assessment beyond their child's 18th birthday where the child is still in secondary school, or

change from being the payer under a child support agreement to the payee following a significant change in care arrangements (

3.1.5.40

).

Consequences of not taking reasonable maintenance action

Where maintenance action is applicable and Centrelink is advised by a social worker or by other means that the individual is not taking reasonable action to obtain maintenance for a child, Centrelink should contact the individual immediately.

The individual's FTB Part A for the relevant child should be reduced to the base rate of FTB Part A, unless the individual:

has been granted an exemption or is in the process of applying for one, or

takes other reasonable action, or subsequently finalises necessary action, to obtain maintenance.

Example:

If Child Support cannot accept an application for child support because it is not satisfied about the parentage of the child, the individual’s FTB Part A will be reduced to the base rate unless the individual applies for an exemption from the MAT. it may also be reasonable for the individual to seek legal assistance to establish parentage.

Example:

An individual may not have sought an extension of the child support assessment for their senior secondary school child beyond the child's 18th birthday. As a result, there is no child support assessment in place for the child from their 18th birthday and only the base rate of FTB Part A will be payable. However, if Child Support subsequently grants the child support assessment extension from the child's 18th birthday, reasonable maintenance action will have been taken and FTB Part A arrears can be paid if applicable.

2.8.2.20 ACCS (grandparent) - relationship with FTB

Summary

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) law does not require a grandparent to be eligible for, or in receipt of

FTB

, in order to receive

ACCS

(grandparent). The reference in the FA law to FTB child does not mean that the individual needs to be eligible for or in receipt of FTB in relation to the child. The practical meaning is that the grandparent cares for the grandchild 65% or more of the time during the

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

).

In some circumstances, a grandparent may have a shared care arrangement recognised for FTB purposes. FTB percentage and ACCS (grandparent) percentage of care do not need to align at all times. Once a FTB shared care determination has been made for a child, the sharing of FTB is continuous, regardless of which person actually has the physical care of the child at any given point in time. ACCS (grandparent) eligibility can change fortnightly based on circumstances. That is, whether or not the grandparent was eligible for ACCS (grandparent) in one fortnight has no direct impact on whether they are eligible in another fortnight.

2.8.4.50 ACCS (transition to work) - applications

Summary

This topic describes the requirement to apply for

ACCS

(transition to work). This topic covers:

applying for ACCS (transition to work)

information required when applying for ACCS (transition to work)

requirement for additional information where the application is incomplete

date of effect of applications for ACCS (transition to work).

Applying for ACCS (transition to work)

To receive ACCS (transition to work) an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must apply through Centrelink online, in person or over the phone.

An individual can apply for ACCS (transition to work) when in receipt of

CCS

or at the same time as claiming CCS. If claiming CCS and applying for ACCS as a combined claim (

1.1.C.27

), the individual must be determined to be eligible for CCS before being assessed for ACCS (transition to work).

If an individual has more than one child in their care, the ACCS (transition to work) subsidy will apply to all of their CCS eligible children.

Information required when applying for ACCS (transition to work)

In addition to information required to claim CCS (such as personal details, income (

1.1.I.20

) estimate and participation details), an individual needs to provide the following information when applying for ACCS (transition to work) (

2.8.4.60

):

the recognised participation which is to be assessed for ACCS (transition to work)

period of which ACCS (transition to work) is being sought

evidence/other documentation to meet the evidentiary requirements for ACCS (transition to work) to support the application.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.8.4.60

ACCS (transition to work) - evidentiary requirements

Requirement for additional information where the application is incomplete

If additional information (such as additional evidence) is required to assess whether the individual is eligible for ACCS (transition to work), the individual will have 28 days in which to provide the information.

If the requested documentation is not provided within 28 days, the application will be taken to have not been made and the individual will be required to submit a new application.

Once the application has been assessed, an individual will receive a notification of the outcome (through their nominated form of communication).

Date of effect of application for ACCS (transition to work)

The earliest start date for a period of ACCS (transition to work) is from the date of application. However, the start date must be the first Monday of a CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

), and the period of ACCS (transition to work) must be whole weeks. ACCS (transition to work) cannot be backdated beyond the date of application.

Where individuals are required to have a Job Plan for their income support payment, they must have an active Job Plan in place to receive ACCS (transition to work). An individual has 28 days from the date of application to enter into a Job Plan (

1.1.J.20

) and for the Job Plan to become active. ACCS (transition to work) cannot be paid until all eligibility requirements are met, which includes having a Job Plan in effect. Where a Job Plan is entered into after the date of application, the start date for ACCS (transition to work) will be the first Monday of the next CCS fortnight after the Job Plan has been entered into and all other ACCS (transition to work) eligibility requirements are met.

Activities that commence during a week are taken to have commenced from the start of that week.

Example:

If a term starts on a Monday, but the individual attends classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, they will be taken to have commenced the activity on the Monday of the week their first Tuesday class occurs. Similarly, if an individual starts a new job and their first shift is on a Wednesday, they will be taken to have started their job from the Monday of that week.

4.7.4 CCS & ACCS absences before child's first attendance or after child's last attendance

Summary

Generally,

CCS

or

ACCS

will not be paid for any absences before the first day the child physically attends care or for absences after the last day the child physically attends care.

However, there are some circumstances where families can be paid CCS for absences that fall within the extended period.

The extended period begins either:

6 days before the first attendance and ends on the first attendance day, or

on the last day of attendance and ends 6 days after the last attendance day.

CCS can be paid for absences within the extended period in the following circumstances apply:

the service changed ownership during the extended period

a family tragedy has occurred (within 28 days before the absence in the extended period)

the usual service is closed, and the child is attending another service from the same provider

any of the specified reasons for additional absences (

1.1.A.17

).

Of the circumstances above, the service changing ownership, usual service is closed, and family tragedy are not additional absence reasons (

4.7.2

). CCS will be paid for these reasons if the child has not exhausted their 42 allowable absences for the year. Evidence must be provided for any additional absence reason for CCS to be claimed when related to the circumstances outlined above.

A family tragedy could include, but is not limited to:

serious injury, illness or death of an immediate family member

the child's carer ceases to be a member of a couple

the child, a carer, or an immediate member of the family is a victim of a serious crime or domestic violence

the child's principal home is lost or sustains major damage.

Note:

Where a service provider has ended an enrolment by mistake (an administrative error) and has restarted the enrolment, absences in the extended period may be payable. In this scenario, a child's enrolment has not in fact ceased, and provided the other requirements for allowable absences are satisfied, the absence would be an allowable absence.

ACCS

payments. This type of debt recovery will occur prior to reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

).

Debt incurred by approved provider

An approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) may incur a debt if a child care service of the provider:

substitutes a session of care report (

1.1.S.35

) with an updated report and the amount of CCS or ACCS initially paid was more than what should have been paid, or

cancels a session of care report and an amount of CCS or ACCS has already been paid to the provider for that report.

A debt incurred by the actions of an approved child care service is owed by the approved provider that operates that service. The debt amount will firstly be automatically offset (at a default of 50%) against the future payments made to that service that undertook the action that led to the debt being incurred. If the payments to that service are insufficient to recover the debt owed in a reasonable period, payments to other services operated by that approved provider may be offset, up to 50%, to recover the debt.

Example:

An approved provider operates 3 services (A, B and C). Service A submits a session report and is paid an amount of CCS. Service A then substitutes that report with another and the amount of CCS initially paid was more than what should have been paid. The debt amount (the difference between what was paid and what should have been paid) will be automatically offset (at a default of 50%) against future payments made to service A. If the payments to service A are insufficient to recover the debt owed in a reasonable period, payments made to services B or C may be offset, up to 50%, to recover the debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 71C Debts in respect of CCS or ACCS—overpayment, section 82 Methods of recovery, section 87A Setting off debts of an approved provider against child care service payments

Debt incurred by individual

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) may incur a debt if:

they report a change in circumstances that might affect their eligibility or entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) to CCS or ACCS

the

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) has been underestimated for the income year, or

they (and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) or ex-partner) fail to meet reconciliation conditions set out in FA(Admin)Act section 103A.

Debts raised during the year will not have any recovery action taken until reconciliation. There are instances where debts (of any amount) that occur during the year are raised and become recoverable, however, this only occurs at the individual’s request. In these instances, the individual must enter into a payment arrangement within 28 days (which, if they are current CCS only customers, will include automatic 20% withholdings from their ongoing CCS entitlement), or interest may be applied.

3.1.6.70 Child support collection

Child Support collection

Payees can apply for assessment and/or collection of child support (

1.1.C.20

) through the Child Support Program administered by Services Australia.

Private collection

Prior to 1 July 2012, unless the payee had been granted an exemption, they were required to privately collect 100% of the amount payable under the order/agreement or the formula assessment, otherwise Child Support collection was required. It was assumed that the payee was collecting 100% unless they advised Centrelink otherwise. Failure to collect the full amount resulted in

FTB

being reduced to the base rate for the child.

From 1 July 2012, the rate of FTB Part A for a child will not be restricted to the base child rate due to the payee privately collecting less than their full child support entitlement. If it is reasonable for the payee to take action to privately collect their full entitlement, they are deemed to have received the full child support entitlement for the purpose of the maintenance income test. The deemed amount applies both when the amount collected is less than the entitlement, and when the amount collected exceeds the entitlement (for example, if the payee subsequently begins to collect the full entitlement plus arrears).

Example:

Samantha has a private collect child support case and is assessed to receive $4,000 per annum. Samantha advises Centrelink that she has only been able to collect $3,500. It is determined that it is reasonable for Samantha to take action to collect the full amount of child support. Samantha would be deemed to have received the full child support entitlement ($4,000) for the maintenance income test, and would continue to satisfy the

MAT

.

A deemed amount of child support will not apply in private collect cases if it is considered reasonable for the payee to collect less than their full entitlement (e.g. where there is a fear of violence). For further details on circumstances when an exemption would be appropriate see

3.1.5.70

.

Where a deemed amount of child support does not apply, child support payments made into a trust account but not paid to the payee or the child are not included when determining the amount of child support received.

1.1.D.50 Day in care (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of assessing a pattern of care, (

1.1.P.70

) for

FTB

, a 'day in care' is usually where an individual (

1.1.I.90

) has the overnight care of a child.

On some occasions, care may be expressed in hours and converted into days in care to establish a pattern of care.

The number of days in care for a child may be used to work out an individual's percentage of care for that child.

Who can claim SBP?

Only an individual (

1.1.I.90

) can claim SBP for a child. An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) cannot claim SBP.

Example:

ACOs include:

a foster care agency, or

a charitable institution that arranges pre-adoptive care.

Act reference:

the individual would have been eligible for FTB in respect of the child, at any time within 26 weeks beginning on the day of the child's delivery, assuming the child had not been stillborn, except that the individual's rate of FTB is nil and the individual must satisfy the 6-month SBP income test, or

) or as a past-period (

1.1.P.60

1.1.B.20

)) for a day within 52 weeks beginning on the day of the child's delivery, and the individual's or the individual's partner's rate of FTB included an FTB Part A rate greater than nil for that day.

This topic.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'stillborn child', section 36 When an individual is eligible for SBP in normal circumstances

SBP income test & FTB Part A eligibility test

Eligibility for SBP is first assessed against the 6-month SBP income test. If the income test and other criteria listed in the table above are satisfied, the individual is eligible for SBP.

An individual meets the SBP income test if the combined estimate of:

the individual's

ATI

for the 6-month period beginning on the day of the child's delivery, and

the ATI of the individual's partner for the same period (where the individual is a member of a couple on the day the claim is made)

is less than or equal to $77,177 and is accepted as a reasonable estimate.

If the SBP income test is not met or the individual does not meet the FTB residency requirements, the individual may still be eligible for SBP under the FTB Part A eligibility test.

An individual meets the FTB Part A eligibility test if they or their partner are eligible to receive FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil in relation to a day that is within 52 weeks beginning of the day of the stillborn child's delivery. The FTB Part A may be claimed either as instalments or a past-period claim, or a bereavement claim due to the death of an FTB or regular care child (

2.1.1.110

). If the FTB Part A eligibility test and other criteria listed in the table above are satisfied, the individual is eligible for SBP.

Individuals who receive SBP may be indirectly affected by reconciliation. Where SBP is paid under the $77,177 income test, it is not reconciled. Where SBP is paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test, the SBP is not reconciled directly, but is raised as a debt where FTB reconciliation results in nil FTB Part A entitlement for the day that SBP was paid.

If it is determined that an individual who is a member of a couple is eligible for SBP in respect of a child, the individual's partner is not eligible for SBP in respect of that child. If both members of a couple lodge a claim for SBP and both claims would otherwise be payable, the payment will be made to the individual who would have been the primary carer of the child had the child been born alive. Generally, this would be the child's birth parent.

An individual can make a claim for SBP on behalf of a deceased individual within 52 weeks after the deceased individual's death, or within a further period as determined by the Secretary, where special circumstances exist.

If it is determined that the other individual is eligible for the payment, no one else is, or can become, eligible for or entitled to SBP in respect of the deceased individual.

4.3.1.20 FTB payment choices for instalment individuals

Summary

'More Choice for Families' gives families more choice and flexibility in how their

FTB

is paid. This enables families to match their payment arrangements more closely to their family circumstances. The FTB payment choices include the following:

Choice 1

The individual can choose to receive the base rate of FTB Part A and all of their FTB Part B entitlement as fortnightly payments. After the end of the relevant income year, the individual's FTB entitlements are reconciled and any top-ups paid (where eligible).

Choice 2

The individual can choose to receive only their FTB Part A entitlements, including

RA

(if eligible), as fortnightly payments.

The individual's entitlement to FTB Part B is assessed after the end of the relevant income year.

Choice 3

The individual can choose to receive the base rate of FTB Part A as fortnightly payments.

The individual is assessed for any further entitlement to FTB Part A and FTB Part B after the end of the relevant income year.

Choice 4

The individual can choose to receive only their FTB Part B entitlement as fortnightly payments.

The individual's entitlement to FTB Part A is assessed after the end of the relevant income year.

Choice 5

The individual can choose to receive all of their FTB Part A, including RA (if eligible), and FTB Part B entitlements as fortnightly payments.

Choice 6

The individual can choose to receive all of their FTB Part A and FTB Part B entitlements after the end of the relevant income year.

They do not receive any fortnightly payments of FTB during the relevant income year.

They may still choose to receive fortnightly payments of RA (if eligible).

An individual may change their choice of delivery method for FTB instalments at any time during the income year.

Individuals who provide a revised estimate of

ATI

during the income year that is higher than their previous income estimate, will, if necessary, have their ongoing rate of FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B automatically adjusted to reduce the risk of having an FTB overpayment at the end of the income year.

When an individual's FTB rate is reduced under mandatory continuous adjustment (

4.3.1.30

) there is still the flexibility for them to choose how they wish to receive their FTB payments. This can be done by selecting a payment option from the table above.

FTB Part A and Part B supplements can only be paid at reconciliation after the end of the income year.

The

ES

aligns with FTB More Choice for Families payment choices. However, individuals who elect to receive their ES payment quarterly (

4.3.1.25

) should be aware that a More Choice for Families deferral option may override their election to receive ES as a quarterly payment.

Note:

Where an individual requests a change of delivery method, the date of effect is the day after the end of the last instalment period, that is, date paid to plus one.

In circumstances where arrears have been determined payable to an individual due to financial hardship, the date of effect of the change to the delivery method may be the later of the date of the original More Choice For Families decision or another date selected by the individual.

Choice 1

Example:

Matt and Andrea have just had their second child.

Matt's income is usually $35,000, however, they are likely to do overtime this year.

During the same financial year, Andrea earned $7,000 before going on leave without pay and will not go back to work before the end of June. Andrea is confident their estimate will not change.

Matt and Andrea are not sure what their combined ATI will be and do not want to risk being overpaid FTB Part A, so they have selected Choice 1.

Matt and Andrea will receive the base rate of FTB Part A and their FTB Part B entitlement as fortnightly payments.

They will be assessed for any further entitlement to FTB Part A, FTB Part B and the supplements after the end of the income year, when their tax returns have been assessed by the

ATO

.

Note:

If Matt provides an increased estimate later in the year, the family's FTB rate will be automatically adjusted as appropriate for the remainder of the year to reflect the change and to avoid any potential overpayment. By choosing this option, they are electing to defer payment of more than the base rate FTB Part A until the end of the year.

Choice 2

Example:

Thanh and Lin already receive FTB for one child and have just had their second child.

Thanh's employment is steady and they have confidently estimated that their income for the current income year will be $75,000.

Lin currently has no income but is thinking about returning to work part-time later in the year.

Lin will need to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return.

Thanh and Lin know they will be entitled to at least the base rate of FTB Part A but, are unsure if they will be entitled to FTB Part B because Lin might return to work before the end of the income year. They select Choice 2. They also have elected to receive the ES quarterly.

Thanh and Lin will receive all of their FTB Part A as fortnightly payments. Their ES Part A will be paid at the end of each quarter.

They will be assessed for any entitlement to FTB Part B and the supplements after the end of the income year when Lin's actual income is known. If they are entitled to FTB Part B, their ES Part B will also be paid at that time.

Note:

If Lin returns to work after June, they will have to notify Centrelink of an increase in their income estimate, and the family's FTB rate will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the income year to reduce the risk of an FTB overpayment. The family may elect to defer their FTB Part B payment until the end of the income year when their actual ATI is known. Lin may also be able to nominate a return to work for FTB Part B quarantine purposes (

3.1.9.30

), if applicable.

Choice 3

Example:

Cheryl and Steve have just had their first child.

Steve earned $36,000 last year and is expecting their income to increase but is not sure by how much.

Cheryl might return to work in February but does not know what their income will be.

Cheryl and Steve are unsure what their combined ATI will be, but they think they might be entitled to more than the base rate of FTB Part A. However, they want to avoid an overpayment. As Cheryl might return to work, they are unsure if they will be entitled to any FTB Part B. Cheryl and Steve think they can afford to wait for any extra FTB, so they select Choice 3.

Cheryl and Steve will receive the base rate of FTB Part A as fortnightly payments.

They will be assessed for any further entitlement to FTB Part A, any entitlement to FTB Part B, and the supplements after the end of the income year when their actual ATI is known.

Cheryl will need to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return.

Note:

If Cheryl does return to work, they will be required to notify Centrelink of an increase in their estimate of ATI for the income year. The family's ongoing rate of FTB for the will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the income year to reduce the risk of an FTB overpayment. Cheryl may also be able to nominate a return to work for FTB Part B quarantine purposes, if applicable.

Choice 4

Example:

Tracy and Elisabeth have 2 children aged 13 and 16.

Tracy earns around $114,000 per year.

Elisabeth is caring full-time for the children at home and has no income.

Tracy's income reduces their FTB Part A to below the base rate for both children, but because Elisabeth will not have any income this income year, and Tracy will not earn above the FTB Part B primary earner income limit (

1.1.I.45

), they are entitled to FTB Part B. Tracy and Elisabeth select Choice 4. They have also elected to receive their ES quarterly.

Tracy and Elisabeth will receive all of their FTB Part B as fortnightly payments. Their ES Part B will be paid at the end of each quarter.

They will be assessed for any entitlement to FTB Part A and the supplements after the end of the income year when Tracy's actual ATI is known. If they are entitled to FTB Part A, their ES Part A will also be paid at that time.

Elisabeth will need to notify Centrelink of her ATI given that she is not required to lodge an income tax return.

Choice 5

Example:

John and Hannah already receive FTB for their 2 children and have just had their niece come to live with them full-time.

John's employment is steady and they are confident of their income estimate.

Hannah stays at home to care for the children and will not return to work in this income year.

Because John's income is steady and Hannah has no income, they have selected Choice 5.

John and Hannah will receive all of their FTB Part A and FTB Part B (excluding the supplements) as fortnightly payments.

If John and Hannah are entitled to any more FTB Part A because John's actual ATI was lower than their estimate, a top-up will be paid into their bank account once the FTB reconciliation conditions are satisfied. However, if Hannah returns to work during the income year or John's actual income was higher than their estimate, they may have an overpayment of both FTB Part A and FTB Part B. Note that Hannah may also be able to nominate a return to work for FTB Part B quarantine purposes, if applicable.

Choice 6

Example:

Luke and Karina receive FTB for their first child and have just had their second child.

They work together in a partnership and they have realised their ATI will be more than what they first estimated for the current income year.

Luke and Karina own the home they live in and are not entitled to any RA.

If Luke and Karina's actual ATI is more than their earlier estimate, they may have already been paid too much FTB during this income year for their older child. Luke and Karina want to avoid an overpayment and can afford to wait until after the end of the income year for any entitlement, so they decide on Choice 6.

Luke and Karina will not receive any further FTB as fortnightly payments.

They will be assessed for any further entitlement to FTB Part A, FTB Part B, and the supplements after the end of the income year when their actual ATI is known.

If Luke and Karina are entitled to any FTB after their tax returns have been assessed by the ATO, any further FTB to which they are entitled will be used to offset any overpayment for the earlier part of the year when they were receiving FTB instalments.

Note:

If Luke or Karina notify Centrelink of an increase in their estimated ATI or if their income estimate is automatically uplifted by Centrelink, their fortnightly payments will be automatically adjusted for the remainder of the income year to reduce the risk of an FTB overpayment. Their FTB rate may be reduced to nil so that they do not receive any fortnightly payments for the remainder of the year. Karina may also be able to nominate a return to work for FTB Part B quarantine purposes, if applicable.

3.1.7.20 Estimating maintenance income

Summary

The amount of maintenance (

) income an

FTB

instalment (

) individual is expected to receive for the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

Explanation:

The actual amount the individual receives will not be known until after the end of the financial year.

The estimated maintenance is then annualised, and the

Methods used to estimate maintenance income

There are 2 methods used by Services Australia to estimate an individual's maintenance income. The entitlement method (

1.1.E.35

) is used to estimate the maintenance income for all individuals who privately collect (

1.1.P.130

) their maintenance.

Individuals whose maintenance is registered for agency collection have a choice between using the entitlement method, or the disbursement method (

1.1.D.100

). The default method for agency collect individuals is the entitlement method. From 1 July 2006, FTB individuals whose child support cases are registered for agency collection and are being assessed under the entitlement method will be assessed under the

MEM

(

1.1.M.65

).

Individuals who have more than one agency collect case can nominate different methods for each case. An individual who has both private and agency collection can choose the disbursement method for their agency collect maintenance, but must use the entitlement method for their private collect maintenance.

Reconciliation

After the end of the financial year, the individual's rate of FTB is reconciled, comparing their estimated maintenance income and estimated

1.1.P.120 Primary carer (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, the primary carer is the member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) identified as having greater responsibility for the children.

The primary carer is the person who generally:

has major daily responsibility for caring for the child/ren in the family

looks after the child/ren's needs

Example:

Dressing, feeding, bathing, outings.

makes most arrangements for the daily needs of the child/ren

makes appointments for the child/ren

Example:

Appointments at school or with doctors or dentists and accompanies them on those appointments.

is the first individual for the day care, school, or college to contact in emergencies, or

is the individual who is responsible for taking the child/ren to and from day care, pre-school, kindergarten or school.

The primary carer may be an individual in receipt of

PP

. Although receipt of PP generally indicates who stays home to care for the children, that individual may not always be the primary carer for

FA

purposes. PP for members of a couple is mainly a payment to provide parents with flexible choices about work and family responsibilities.

Paying FA to the primary carer arises from provisions that prevent FA from being paid to more than one individual for the same child.

A 'stillborn' child means a child:

who weighs at least 400 grams at delivery or whose period of gestation was at least 20 weeks

who has not breathed since delivery, and

whose heart has not beaten since delivery.

Note 1:

The child must have been certified by a qualified medical practitioner as having been 'delivered'.

Note 2:

Gestation is considered to be the period in which the unborn child is carried in the womb from conception to delivery. If the child is stillborn, the date of delivery is used to calculate gestation.

1.2.19 Stillborn baby payment (SBP) - description

Summary

This section includes information on:

SBP

objectives

SBP eligibility

SBP rate, and

how SBP is paid.

Objective of SBP

The SBP provides assistance with the extra costs associated with a stillborn child.

SBP eligibility

The SBP may be paid where an individual, or their partner, would have been the primary carer of a stillborn child (

1.1.S.130

).

Eligibility for the SBP is met where a stillborn child is delivered and either:

had the child been born alive, the individual would have been eligible for

FTB

in respect of the child at any time within the period of 26 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery, or

had the child been born alive, the individual would have been eligible for FTB in respect of the child at any time within the period of 26 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery, except that the individual's rate of FTB would have been nil, and

the individual's and, if they are a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) on the day the claim is made, the individual's partner's combined estimate of

ATI

does not exceed the SBP income limit (

2.12.1

) for the 6-month period beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery, or

the individual or their partner is entitled to FTB Part A (for another FTB child) for a day during the 52 week period beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery whether claimed as an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

), past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) or a bereavement claim for a deceased FTB or regular care child (

1.1.B.20

).

Example:

Des and Diane have 4 children and are receiving FTB Part A by instalment payments. On 5 November 2017, Diane's fifth child is delivered stillborn. As Diane is not able to receive

PLP

, she lodges a claim for SBP. As their estimated family income is above the SBP income limit for the 6 month period post-delivery of their child, they are then assessed for SBP using their FTB Part A entitlement.

The SBP income limit is subject to indexation annually from 1 July 2017.

An individual is not eligible for SBP for a stillborn child where that individual or their partner receives PLP for that same stillborn child.

Example:

Mary and Fred's child was delivered on 2 November 2017 and was stillborn. Mary lodges a claim for PLP for the child which is granted. Neither Mary nor Fred is eligible for SBP for that child.

SBP rate

The rate of SBP is equal to the total of the following rates:

the higher rate of

NBS

NBU

, and

FTB Part A bereavement payment (14 weeks of the FTB Part A maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13).

See

3.12

for more detail on the SBP rate.

How SBP is paid

In normal circumstances, an eligible individual must have an effective claim for SBP before the end of 52 weeks beginning on the day of the delivery of the stillborn child. SBP is payable only as a lump sum payment.

2.1.1.25 Shared care of an FTB child

Summary

Two or more adults who are not members of the same couple (

1.1.M.50

) and who care for an

FTB

child can each be eligible for FTB for that child at the same time, provided each adult cares for the child between 35% and 65% of the care period (

1.1.C.100

). A determination must be made regarding the percentage of FTB to which an individual is entitled in respect of the FTB child. Once a determination has been made to share FTB for a child, eligibility for FTB is continuous for each person, regardless of which person actually has the physical care of the child at any given point in time.

Note:

From 1 July 2010, an assessment of shared care that is determined by either

Centrelink

for

FA

purposes or Child Support for child support purposes will have effect for the other scheme in relation to care periods that begin on or after this date. This means that where a care percentage has been determined by Child Support, that determination will be aligned for the purpose of FA and will be applied in determining the individual's care percentage for FTB purposes. If there has been a change in the level of care, Centrelink may still need to determine the care percentage. Child Support uses the same rules to verify shared care as Centrelink (

2.1.1.30

). These changes do not affect care determinations made before 1 July 2010 (

2.1.1.50

).

Generally, shared care is between parents of a child, however another family member, or unrelated adult, may also care for the child.

This topic explains the following issues associated with determining FTB shared care where:

only one member of a couple can be eligible for FTB at a time

a shared care determination is being made

separated couples are living under one roof, and

separated couples are both claiming FTB for a period before they separated.

The steps that need to be taken to establish the pattern of care, and to calculate the percentage of care are explained in separate topics. FTB for blended families (

1.1.B.30

) and disputed care is also covered in separate topics.

Determination of shared care percentage

Where 2 or more adults, who are not members of a couple, have care of an FTB child, a determination must be made as to each adult's percentage of care for the child.

Where possible, the percentage to be applied in the shared care determination should be:

the percentage of care agreed to by all parties who share the care of the child, or

the agreed pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

).

Where the carers do not agree on the level of care, the decision maker will determine the care percentage to be applied based on the available evidence of the actual pattern of care.

This percentage is applied when calculating the standard rate (

1.1.S.103

) of FTB Part A and FTB Part B each person is eligible to receive.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 59 Shared care percentages where individual is FTB child of more than one person who are not members of the same couple, Schedule 1 clause 11 Sharing FTB (shared care percentages), Schedule 1 clause 27 Sharing FTB (shared care percentages), Schedule 1 clause 31 Sharing FTB (shared care percentages)

3.1.1.30

Shared care rate for FTB

Percentage of care is less than 35%

Where there are 2 carers and the minimum percentage of care rule is not met for one of them, FTB will be paid to the primary carer as if they were providing 100% of the care.

Example:

Scott cares for a child for 22% of the time, and Maria cares for the child for the rest of the time. Since Scott has the child for less than 35% of the care period, Scott is not eligible for FTB, but may be eligible for

RA

and other Government benefits as the child is a regular care child (

1.1.R.21

). Maria is eligible for 100% of the payment for the FTB child.

If there are 3 or more carers, and one or more of the carers are not eligible for FTB because they have less than 35% care, the percentage is divided between the remaining eligible carers. Depending on the level of care that the eligible carers have, it may be fair to divide the FTB equally between these carers. However, in some circumstances, it may be more equitable to divide the FTB according to the time spent with these remaining carers.

Example:

Danielle cares for Naomi for 60% of the care period. Jennifer has 36% care of Naomi for the care period, and Claudia (Jennifer's mother) has 4% care. Claudia is not eligible for FTB. Under the terms of their family law order (

1.1.F.10

) Danielle's pattern of care does not change relative to when Claudia has care. However, Jennifer also shares the time they have with Naomi with their mother. In this case it is reasonable to increase Jennifer's percentage of care to 40% (36% + 4%), while Danielle's percentage remains at 60%. This will result in Jennifer receiving 35% of FTB while Danielle will receive 65%.

Note:

For child support purposes, the care percentages determined in the above example will be aligned in relation to the 60:36:4 care percentage split between Danielle, Jennifer and Claudia. The allocation of a remaining care percentage from an ineligible carer is specific to FA.

Act reference:

section 25 Effect of an individual's percentage of care …, section 59 Shared care percentages where …

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.20

Shared care & change of care summary

Separated couple still living together

A couple who have separated, but are still sharing a home may share the care of an FTB child. Centrelink will determine FTB eligibility and the relevant shared care percentages for each individual based on their individual circumstances and the evidence available. Generally, where each individual contributes in a similar manner to the care of the child, the care percentage will be 50%. The care percentage determined by Centrelink will remain in place until either individual provides evidence that the care arrangements for the child have changed.

Sharing FTB between a separated couple for a period prior to separation - past period claim

If the Secretary is satisfied that 2 individuals:

are no longer members of a couple

have an eligible FTB child for a past period, and

would both have been eligible for FTB but for subsection 26(1) (only one member of a couple eligible for FTB), then

the Secretary may determine that both individuals are eligible for that period, and determine the percentage of care applicable for each individual for that period.

The individuals can agree on the percentage of care they each had for their FTB child, providing the total care percentage does not exceed 100%. If they do not agree on a percentage of care, an assessment of their actual level of care for the period must be made. In this case the level of care for the period being claimed for must be declared, and the determination of the percentage of FTB to be paid for each person will be the same as for any other shared care case.

The decision on the percentage of FTB to which each individual is entitled will be based on principles of fairness and appropriateness, taking into account equity considerations, and the sharing and pooling of resources within a family unit that can result in a 50:50 split of FTB.

1.1.I.70

).

The following conditions need to be satisfied for a child to be a higher rate child for a session of care provided to that child in a CCS fortnight:

an individual or their partner must be eligible for CCS in relation to the child

the family must earn below $367,563

there must be another child in the same family who is a standard rate child (

1.1.S.104

)

the higher rate child must be 5 years old or under on the first Monday of the CCS fortnight.

). Any maintenance paid during the 13-week period of grace to take maintenance action is counted as maintenance income as part of the maintenance income test.

Example:

Geoff and Rachael are separated and Rachael has care of their 3 children. Geoff agrees to pay Rachael $300 per fortnight voluntary maintenance until his liability is assessed by Child Support. In the absence of an assessed liability, the full amount Jeff pays is assessed under the maintenance income test. Once his liability has been assessed by Child Support, Geoff is required to pay the amount as assessed by Child Support.

1.1.T.52 Third party payments & discounts (CCS, ACCS)

Definition

When a third party contributes to a family’s early childhood education and care (ECEC) fees, the approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) must deduct the contribution from the total session fee before applying the

CCS

percentage (

1.1.A.70

). This ensures families only receive CCS for the amount they are charged, as required under

FA

law.

Example:

Dante attends Daisy Child Care. The service charges $100 per session, and his family have a CCS entitlement of 60%. As a result, his parents normally pay a gap fee of $40 per session. However, Dante’s father’s employer is contributing $40 to Dante’s fees. Daisy Child Care deducts $40 from the original session fee before reporting. The new session fee is $60, and the CCS and gap fee for Dante’s sessions is recalculated on the new fee. Now Dante’s sessions receive $36 CCS, and his family pay a gap fee of $24.

Exceptions

Prescribed discounts

Certain contributions are exempt from this rule and allow third parties or providers to contribute to the gap fee without reducing the family’s CCS entitlement. These are:

prescribed third-party payments

discounted care for early childhood workers

discounted care for a period of emergency.

State or territory government payments

State and territory governments may contribute to some or all of a family’s gap fee with no impact on CCS in the following circumstances:

contributions from a state or territory government for a disadvantaged or vulnerable child

contributions from a state or territory government for a child attending a preschool program at a

CBDC

service.

Example:

Sunny also attends Daisy Child Care, and her family has a CCS entitlement of 85%. As a result, her parents normally pay a gap fee of $15 per session. However, because Sunny is considered vulnerable the state government contributes $15 to the family’s fees. Because this is a prescribed third-party payment, Daisy Child Care does not need to reduce the session fee before reporting. As a result, Sunny still receives $85 of CCS, but the gap fee for her family is now $0.

Discounted care for early childhood workforce

Approved providers can apply a discount after the CCS calculation for the child of an educator or cook that is employed by that provider. The criteria for the discount are the:

employee must be employed, contracted or engaged at that service in a week that the child attends that service

service must be a CBDC or

OSHC

service

family must still pay a gap fee that is at least 5% of the hourly session fee.

Example:

Mark works as a cook at Daisy Child Care. His child attends the service 2 days per week and receives 60% CCS. Normally, Mark pays a gap fee of $40 per session, however, Daisy Child Care is offering a 75% workforce discount. Now Mark still receives $60 CCS per session, but his gap fee is reduced by 75% to $10.

Discounted care for a period of emergency

Approved providers can apply a discount for families where a period of emergency (

1.1.P.78

) as declared by the Department of Education is in effect. This discount can be applied when:

a child does not attend care at a service within the area of emergency

Note

: This does not apply where the child has attended for part of a day.

the emergency has caused the ECEC service to close.

Note:

This does not apply for partial closures.

Record keeping requirements

Approved providers must maintain records of all third-party payments and discounts, including how the contributions were applied to family accounts.

Providers must also include information on prescribed discounts in session reports and statements of entitlements.

3.2.7 Deductible child maintenance expenditure

Summary

This topic explains the assessment of

DCME

as a reduction in

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the

FTB

,

CCS

,

ACCS

and

SBP

income tests. This topic covers the following:

what is child maintenance expenditure?

assessing DCME, and

assessing the value of child maintenance expenditure.

What is child maintenance expenditure?

Child maintenance expenditure is a payment or benefit (for example, child support (

1.1.C.20

)) provided by an individual (

1.1.I.90

) and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) to the other parent or carer for their natural, adoptive or relationship children (

1.1.R.22

). It does not include spousal maintenance.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 8(2) Child maintenance expenditure, section 3(1)-'child support'

Assessing DCME

Where an individual has child maintenance expenditure for a particular income year, 100% of the amount is deducted from their income when calculating their ATI for that year. For the purposes of the SBP income test, 100% of the amount is deducted from their income when calculating their estimated ATI for the relevant 6-month income test period. For further details on how the income test period is defined for SBP see

4.15.1

.

If the claim is for FTB, CCS or ACCS and is for the current income year, the individual must estimate the amount of child maintenance expenditure they and/or their partner expect to incur for that year. For a claim for SBP, the individual must estimate what will be the amount of maintenance they and/or their partner expect to incur over the relevant 6-month income test period, including where this period crosses into the next financial year.

If the claim is for a past period in a previous income year, the child maintenance expenditure for FTB purposes is the actual amount the individual and/or their partner incurred for that year. For SBP, where a past period claim relates to an SBP income test period that falls entirely in a previous income year, the child maintenance expenditure is the amount incurred by the individual and/or their partner for the relevant 6-month period in that year. If the past period claim for SBP relates to a 6-month income test period that crosses 2 income years, the child maintenance expenditure is the amount incurred by the individual and/or their partner for the relevant 6-month period across those 2 years.

The deduction for maintenance expenditure is first applied against the income (

1.1.I.20

) of the individual who incurred the expense. If the expense exceeds the income of that individual, the remaining expense can be applied against the combined family income. The combined family income cannot be offset to an amount less than nil.

Example:

Mary has estimated that she will have income of $36,500 for the income year. She estimates that she will pay $4,500 to her ex-partner as child maintenance. Mary's current partner Bruce estimates that he will earn $45,000 for the year and pay $9,500 maintenance to his ex-partner. Mary's ATI is $32,000 ($36,500 - $4,500) and Bruce's ATI is $35,500 ($45,000 - $9,500). Their combined estimate of ATI is $67,500 ($32,000 + $35,500).

Example:

Anne has estimated that she will have income of $18,000 for the 6-month period following her child's stillbirth. This 6-month period crosses the 2013-14 and 2014-15 income years. She estimates that she will pay $1,500 to her ex-partner as child maintenance in the first income year and $500 to her ex-partner in the second income year (total of $2,000). Anne's current partner, John, estimates that he will earn $50,000 for the same 6-month period and pay $8,000 maintenance to his ex-partner in the first income year and $3,000 to this ex-partner in the second income year (total of $11,000). Anne's ATI for the 6-month period is $16,000 ($18,000 - $2,000) and John's ATI for the 6-month period is $39,000 ($50,000 - $11,000). Their combined estimate of ATI for the 6-month period is $55,000 ($16,000 + $39,000).

Example:

Josh has estimated that he will have an income of $3,000 for the income year. He estimates that he will pay $9,000 to his ex-partner as child maintenance. Josh’s current partner Emma estimates that she will earn $80,000 for the year. Josh’s ATI is –$6,000 ($3,000 - $9,000) and Emma’s ATI is $80,000. Their combined estimate of ATI is $74,000 (–$6,000 + $80,000).

Assessing the value of the child maintenance expenditure

The following table explains the different ways maintenance is paid and the amount that is assessed as expenditure.

For maintenance that is paid …

the assessed value is the …

periodically in cash, or through Child Support

amount paid.

through a child support agreement under the Child Support Assessment Act as:

non-cash maintenance (

1.1.M.10

), or

capitalised maintenance

amount specified in the agreement, or the cost to the individual if the amount is different.

Example for FTB/CCS/ACCS:

If an individual pays a lump sum amount to their ex-partner as child support for the next 4 years, the cost to the individual for the year of the lump sum payment is the whole lump sum. In the proceeding 3 years there is no cost to the individual.

Example for SBP:

If an individual pays this type of lump sum amount to their ex-partner, for the purposes of the SBP income test, the lump sum payment must be made in the relevant 6-month income test period following the delivery of the child or the date the child was entrusted to care, to be included in the income test. If the payment relates to a period that is longer than 6 months, less than the full amount will be included. This is similar to the treatment of lump income for the purpose of the SBP income test (

3.2.8.10

).

Example:

If an individual can obtain health insurance for their children at a discounted rate, the discounted rate is what is assessed.

amount nominated by the individual and for which the individual is able to provide documentary evidence.

Example:

Documentary evidence may be a court order or a letter from the maintenance individual.

1.1.D.100 Disbursement method (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of the

FTB

maintenance income test, under the disbursement method, an individual's FTB Part A rate is recalculated each time there is a change to the monthly amount of child support they receive from Child Support. Consequently, the individual's FTB Part A rate can change every month. The disbursement method is an alternative way of estimating the amount of child support (

1.1.C.20

) an FTB instalment recipient will receive during the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

).

The disbursement method is based on the actual amount of child support disbursed by Child Support each month. It can only be used for child support liabilities that are registered for collection by Child Support. The disbursement method cannot be used for FTB recipients who collect their child support through private collect arrangements.

7.2.9 Recovery from financial institutions

Summary

This section provides information on recovering amounts of

FA

that are made to a financial institution for the credit of an account kept with the institution.

Intended individual not an account holder with the institution

If FA payments were made to a financial institution for the credit of an account kept with the institution and the payments were intended for someone other than the person in whose name the account was kept, Centrelink may give a written notice to the institution requiring it to pay back the lesser of the following amounts:

the amount of the FA payments

the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is given to the institution.

The financial institution would be required to repay the money within a reasonable period and this period would be specified in the notice.

Where an account with an institution is in the names of more than one individual, this provision applies if the payment was intended for someone who was not one of the individuals in whose names the account was kept.

Death of the intended individual

If FA payments are made to a financial institution for the credit of an account that was kept with the institution and the intended individual to receive payments died before the payments were made, Centrelink may give a written notice to the institution requiring it to pay back the lesser of the following amounts:

the amount of the FA payments

the amount standing to the credit of the account when the notice is received by the institution.

The financial institution would be required to repay the money within a reasonable period and this period would be specified in the notice.

Summary

This topic explains the general requirement for an individual (

1.1.I.90

) to advise Centrelink of changes in their circumstances and covers:

relevance of a change of circumstances

general circumstances which must be notified.

Individuals who are eligible for

CCS

or

ACCS

have an obligation to notify Centrelink about change of circumstances that might affect their eligibility (

1.1.E.17

) or entitlement (

1.1.E.30

). Centrelink may also request information from individuals.

Unless otherwise stated eligibility circumstances and rate circumstances are the same for

FTB

Part A and FTB Part B.

Relevance of a change of circumstances

A person (

1.1.P.80

) must provide information about changes of circumstances to Centrelink if it is relevant to:

the individual's eligibility for

FA

determining the amount of their entitlement

verifying their eligibility

determining if FA has been paid to individuals who were not entitled to receive payment

determining if a person owes a debt (

1.1.D.60

)

assisting to locate a person who owes a debt.

Centrelink may be aware of some of the changes in a person's circumstances from its own records and the individual may not be required to provide it.

Example:

Centrelink does not need to be advised of an FTB child turning a particular age, as this information is obtained from Centrelink records.

General circumstances which must be notified

An individual must notify Centrelink of any changes to:

address (postal or residential)

bank account details.

Individuals intending to claim FTB as a lump sum do not need to advise of these changes, although they will be expected to have kept the appropriate records when they do submit their claim at the end of the financial year.

4.15.1 Claims for SBP

Summary

A claim for

SBP

can be made without an

FTB

claim. SBP is subject to a separate income test from FTB depending on the family's circumstances. This topic includes:

who can claim SBP

not effective SBP claim

types of claim

lodgement of SBP claim

provision of estimate of income for SBP claim

TFN

requirements

verification of stillborn child's

DOB

, and

restrictions on claiming SBP.

Who can claim SBP

Only an individual can claim SBP. An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) cannot claim SBP.

Note:

ACOs include:

a foster care agency, or

a charitable institution that arranges pre-adoptive care.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 36 When an individual is eligible for SBP in normal circumstances

Not effective SBP claim

A claim for SBP is not effective unless:

it is made in a form and manner which contains any information and is accompanied by any documents required by the Secretary

(in the case of a claim for SBP in normal circumstances) the claim contains the sum of the individual's

ATI

and, if the individual is a member of a couple on the day the claim is made, the ATI of their partner for the 6-month period beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery

(in the case of a claim for SBP in normal circumstances) the TFN requirements are met (

4.1.1.70

)

(in the case of a claim for SBP because of the death of another individual) it contains the TFN of the TFN substitution person (

1.1.T.50

), and

(in the case of a claim for SBP in normal circumstances) the claim is made before the end of the period of 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery.

A claim for SBP is not effective if the claimant has previously made a claim based on the same circumstances (whether or not the claim has yet been determined).

If a claim is effective, the Secretary must determine the claim. If the claim is not effective, it is taken not to have been made.

Determination of SBP claims

Types of claim

An individual may make a claim for SBP:

in normal circumstances claim, or

because of the death of another individual (that is, a bereavement claim).

Note:

If an individual is eligible for SBP for a child and the individual dies before they have been paid SBP, a bereavement claim for SBP for that child may be made by another individual where the Secretary considers that the other individual ought to be eligible for the payment. If SBP is paid to the other individual for that child, no one else is or can be eligible for the payment for that child.

Act reference:

FAAct

Part 3 Division 2 Subdivision B Eligibility of individuals for SBP where death occurs

Lodgement of SBP claim

A claim for SBP in normal circumstances must be lodged before the end of the period of 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery.

If an individual is unable to make a claim for SBP in normal circumstances because of severe illness associated with the birth of the stillborn child, the Secretary may extend the SBP claim period as they consider appropriate.

Where an individual or their partner has claimed

PLP

for the stillborn child and the claim is rejected within 13 weeks of the end of the 52 week SBP claim timeframe, or after the end of the 52 week SBP claim timeframe, an SBP claim may be lodged for that child within 13 weeks after the day on which the notice of rejection of the PLP claim is given.

Example:

Renee gave birth to a stillborn child on 31 March 2024 and later lodges a PLP claim for this child on 31 January 2025. Renee's PLP claim is rejected on 28 February 2025. Renee is able to lodge a claim for SBP for the stillborn child within 13 weeks of the date they are notified that the PLP claim was rejected.

Where an individual has a stillborn child and claims FTB Part A for another child in relation to a day which is within 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery, and notification of the FTB Part A grant is given either within 13 weeks of the 52 weeks SBP claim time limit or outside of the 52 week SBP claim limit, an SBP claim may be lodged for the stillborn child within 13 weeks of the day on which notice of the grant of the FTB Part A claim is given. This applies to both instalment and lump sum/past period FTB claims and could potentially extend the time limit on SBP claims over a longer period.

Example:

Tully gave birth to a stillborn child on 1 May 2024 and did not claim SBP for the child as they knew they would not meet the 6-month income test. On 5 April 2025, Tully gives birth to another child and lodges a claim for FTB Part A, which is granted on 25 April 2025. Tully is able to lodge an SBP claim for the stillborn child within 13 weeks of the date they are notified that the FTB claim was granted.

Note:

Fifty-two weeks is a period of 364 days. For example, if a child is stillborn on 1 January in a non-leap year, 364 days (52 weeks) from the DOB would end on midnight of 30 December.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 39 Restrictions on claiming

Provision of estimate of income for SBP claim

An effective SBP claim must contain an estimate of the individual's and/or their partner's ATI for the relevant 6-month period and the estimate and must be accepted as reasonable. The individual only needs to include their partner's ATI if they were partnered on the day the claim is made.

For SBP claims, the relevant 6-month period commences on the day of the stillborn child's delivery.

Act reference:

6.4.3.30 Outcomes of non-lodger process

Summary

This topic outlines the possible outcomes of the non-lodger (

1.1.N.33

) process:

when an individual (

1.1.I.90

) responds to contact by Centrelink

when an individual lodges outstanding tax return/s

when an individual fails to respond to contact by Centrelink

the amounts of

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) to be raised as debts

prohibition of

FTB

based on an estimate, and

non-entitlement to payment of FTB.

For the purposes of

CCS

, all individuals (including those not required to lodge an income tax return) must meet the CCS reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

) conditions, including providing their

ATI

to Centrelink.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.1

Overview of reconciliation

Individual responds to contact by Centrelink

FA can be reconciled if the individual:

notifies Centrelink of their combined ATI for the relevant year because they and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) are not required to lodge an income tax return, and

all the other conditions for reconciliation have been met.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.2.10

Verification of adjusted taxable income,

6.4.3.10

Valid reasons for not lodging a tax return

Individual lodges outstanding tax return/s

An individual has their entitlement for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) reconciled under the reconciliation process if they and/or their partner lodge an income tax return by the end of the lodgement period. If the individual lodges a tax return after the end of the lodgement period, late lodger rules may apply.

Individual fails to respond to contact by Centrelink

An individual has a debt due to the Commonwealth if they and/or their partner have not lodged an income tax return, or have not notified Centrelink of their combined ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

).

Amount of debts to be raised - FTB

For FTB, the total amount of FTB paid to an individual for the relevant income year is raised as a debt if the individual fails to meet the reconciliation conditions by the end of the lodgement year or a further period as allowed by the Secretary. This includes all FTB components, such as

NBS

,

RA

and FTB Part B etc. and the

NBU

where applicable.

Note:

Where NBS and/or NBU are included in a non-lodger debt, the individual's entitlement to NBS and/or NBU for that child is not reassessed until the non-lodger status is resolved.

Individuals who choose to defer some of their FTB entitlement for the relevant income year and do not lodge an income tax return by the end of the lodgement year will be subject to a non-lodger debt for the amount of FTB they actually received during the relevant income year.

For a non-lodger debt to arise due to an individual’s partner not lodging an income tax return or not notifying Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, the individual must still be partnered, as at the date the non-lodger debt is raised, with the same person with whom they were partnered as at 30 June of the relevant income year.

If an individual or their partner subsequently lodges their income tax return/s, or notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, after a debt has been raised, the debt determination must be varied to reflect that the individual was entitled to the lesser of:

the amount of FA the individual was entitled to be paid during the relevant income year based on their estimated income, or

the amount of FA the individual was entitled to be paid based on actual ATI.

Explanation:

This means that the individual will not be entitled to receive any top-up payment or FTB supplements as they have lodged their income tax return/s after the lodgement year (

6.4.1.30

).

An individual who has chosen to defer some of their FTB entitlement for the relevant year and lodges a tax return after the end of the lodgement year can only be paid for the relevant income year the lesser of their legislative entitlement based on ATI or the amount they would have received had the choice not been made to defer some or all of FTB.

Amount of debts to be raised - FTB advance

For FTB advances (

1.2.8

), the total amount of the advance repaid by the individual during the relevant income year is raised as an FTB advance debt if the individual fails to respond to Centrelink's non-lodger letters. The total amount repaid is the sum of the daily reduction amounts applied during the relevant income year.

After an FTB advance debt has been raised due to a non-lodger determination, if an individual or their partner subsequently lodges their income tax return/s or advise that they are not required to lodge income tax return/s the FTB advance debt is extinguished (that is, it is taken never to have been an FTB advance debt) and normal reconciliation processes will apply where all other conditions for reconciliation have been met.

Amount of debts to be raised -

SBP

For SBP (paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test), the total amount of the payment is raised as a debt if the individual fails to lodge relevant tax returns by the end of the lodgement year or a further period as allowed by the Secretary.

Note:

SBP (where paid under the 6 month income test) is not raised as a debt as there is no tax lodgement requirement.

Note:

Where an SBP debt is raised due to an FTB non-lodger decision, the individual's entitlement to SBP for that child is not reassessed until the non-lodger status is resolved.

Act reference:

Prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Where an individual has not met the reconciliation conditions for a relevant income year by the end of the lodgement year and Centrelink makes a non-lodger decision that resulted in a debt, and the debt is still outstanding, they will be prohibited from receiving FTB payments based on an estimate (

1.1.P.135

). The prohibition of FTB will also apply to the individual’s current partner.

Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate of income due to 3 or more non-lodger decisions

From 1 July 2010 if an individual has 3 or more FTB non-lodger decisions (variations under FA(Admin)Act subsection 28(2) for an income year) because the individual and/or their partner did not meet the reconciliation conditions for the relevant income year, and for at least one of those decisions there is an outstanding FTB non-lodger debt that has not been fully repaid, the individual (and/or their partner, if applicable) will lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate of income.

Treatment of non-lodger decisions made before 1 July 2010

Non-lodger decisions that were made before 1 July 2010 that did not generate a debt or where the debt was repaid before 1 July 2010 do not count towards the 3 non-lodger decisions for non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate of income. Only variations for which there is an outstanding non-lodger debt as at 1 July 2010 onwards will apply for the purposes of determining non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate of income.

3.1.7.15 Relevant period

Summary

This topic outlines the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) as it applies to the assessment of maintenance income for the purposes of

FTB

. It covers:

determining the relevant period

determining the relevant period where bereavement or change of care occurs

determining the relevant period where there is more than one payer

start of the relevant period

end of the relevant period, and

treatment of gaps in the relevant period.

Determining the relevant period

Generally, the relevant period is the financial year for which FTB is being paid. However, if the individual has separated, reconciled, or gained an FTB child during the financial year, the relevant period is the period during which the individual is entitled to receive maintenance for an FTB child or children.

Example:

Mary has one child from a previous relationship. She is receiving FTB payments for the child from 1 July. On 5 October Mary and the father of her child reconciled. The relevant period for Mary's entitlement to maintenance for her child in that financial year would be from 1 July to 4 October.

Note:

The relevant period does not apply to capitalised maintenance income. Capitalised maintenance income is assessed separately.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20A Annualised amount of maintenance income, Schedule 1 clause 24 Apportionment of capitalised maintenance income

Relevant period where bereavement or change of care occurs

Where an individual is entitled to receive maintenance in respect of only one FTB child, and that FTB child dies, the maintenance liability and therefore the relevant period ends on the date the FTB child died. Any child support received for the deceased child during or after the bereavement period does not extend the relevant period and the maintenance received is disregarded for the purpose of the maintenance income test.

Similarly, if there is an entitlement to maintenance in respect of only one FTB child and that FTB child leaves the care of the individual, the relevant period would end on the date the FTB child left care.

However, if there is an entitlement to maintenance from one payer in respect of more than one FTB child and one of the FTB children dies, the entitlement to maintenance continues for the other FTB child/ren in the child support case and the relevant period continues after the death of the child. Any maintenance received for the deceased child during the bereavement period is assessable under the maintenance income test. Any maintenance received for the deceased child after the end of the bereavement period is not assessable and is disregarded.

Similarly, if there is an entitlement to maintenance in respect of more than one FTB child and one of the FTB children leaves the care of the individual, the entitlement to maintenance continues for the other FTB child/ren, and the relevant period continues after the child left care.

Example:

Joanne receives FTB for her 2 children, Wendy and Bob, who are from a previous relationship. Joanne has a private collect child support case in place from 1 July 2014, with an annual assessment of $9,648.00 for the 2 children ($4,824.00 per annum each). On 2 September 2014, Joanne advises that Wendy died on 30 August 2014. The 14 week bereavement period for Wendy starts on 30 August 2014 and finishes on 5 December 2014. Child Support advises Centrelink that the child support assessment amount for Bob has been amended from 30 August 2014 to $6,494.00 per annum. As Joanne is still entitled to receive maintenance for Bob, the relevant period continues and any maintenance received for Wendy during the bereavement period or prior to her death continues to be assessed under the maintenance income test. Therefore to determine the maintenance amount to be included in the maintenance income test during the relevant period we must first determine how much maintenance was deemed to be received before and after it was amended; i.e.

First part of relevant period: 1 July 2014 to 29 August 2014 is 60 days.

Maintenance received during first part:

Bob: $4,824.00 (annual assessment) ÷ 365 days = daily amount of $13.22 × 60 days = $792.99

Wendy: $4,824.00 (annual assessment) ÷ 365 days = daily amount of $13.22 × 60 days = $792.99

Total maintenance received during this period: $792.99 + $792.99 = $1,585.98

Second part of relevant period: 30 August 2014 to 30 June 2015 is 305 days.

Maintenance received during second part:

Bob: $6,494.00 (amended annual assessment) ÷ 365 days = daily amount of $17.79 × 305 days = $5,426.49

Wendy: deceased, no longer in the child support assessment

Total maintenance received during this period: $5,426.49

Therefore the total maintenance deemed to be received during the relevant period is:

First part ($1,585.98) + second part ($5,426.49) = $7,012.47.

The maintenance received during the relevant period then must be annualised (

6.4.2.30

) i.e.

$7,012.47 (maintenance income for the relevant period) × (365 (days in income year) ÷ 365 (days in relevant period)) = $7,012.47

Therefore, $7,012.47 is the maintenance income amount applied from 30 August 2014 to 30 June 2015 (pending any further changes). At reconciliation, the amount of $7,012.47 is applied to the full financial year (

3.1.7.21

).

Note:

An individual continues to be eligible for FTB for a deceased FTB child for a period of 14 weeks from the day the child died. The individual is generally eligible for the same rate of FTB that would have been paid if the child had not died (

3.1.1.40

).

If the above child support case were registered for collection by Child Support and Joanne received arrears of child support for Wendy during the 14 week bereavement period (for example in November 2014), the arrears would be included in the maintenance income test. If the amount was received after the end of the bereavement period (for example in February 2015), the arrears would not be included in the maintenance income test.

More than one payer (

1.1.P.72

)

The relevant period applies in relation to the entitlement to receive maintenance from each payer for the relevant FTB child or children (

1.1.M.23

). Therefore, if an individual has children from more than one previous relationship, there will be a separate relevant period for each payer.

Example:

Kylie has 2 children from 2 previous relationships. Kylie claimed FTB instalments from 1 July. On 3 September Kylie reconciled with Samantha, the other parent of her youngest child. Ben, the other parent of her oldest child died in an accident on 1 May the following calendar year. There are 2 relevant periods in that financial year for Kylie's entitlement to maintenance. These are for the period from 1 July to 2 September for the entitlement from Samantha, and for the period 1 July to 30 April for the entitlement from Ben.

Start of the relevant period

The relevant period generally begins at the start of the income (financial) year. However, if an event occurs after the start of the income (financial) year that creates an entitlement to maintenance, such as a separation, the relevant period starts from whichever is the earlier of when:

an entitlement to maintenance begins under a formal liability, or

voluntary maintenance (

1.1.V.20

) payments begin.

The relevant period relates to the assessed entitlement to maintenance, not the amount received. For example, if a payer has a nil assessment from Child Support, the relevant period commences from the date of the assessment.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20A(3) Commencement of relevant period

End of the relevant period

The relevant period generally finishes at the end of the income (financial) year unless, before the end of that year:

voluntary maintenance payments cease, or

the entitlement to maintenance under the payer's liability ceases.

Note:

If arrears of maintenance are received after the maintenance entitlement ceases (after the end of the relevant period) the arrears do not affect payment of FTB.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20A(6) End of relevant period

Gaps in the relevant period

The number of days in a relevant period is not reduced by a gap between a period of voluntary maintenance and a period where a maintenance entitlement under a formal liability exists.

Example:

John has paid Marie $400.00 voluntary maintenance in a period of 60 days followed by a gap of 40 days where no maintenance income is received and no maintenance liability exists. He then pays $600.00 maintenance income for a liability of 120 days.

The annualised maintenance income for the total of 220 days is:

$1,000.00 × (365 ÷ 220) = $1,659.09

The effect of this is to assess $1,659.09 over 220 days, rather than over 180 days which is:

$1,000.00 × (365 ÷ 180) = $2,027.77 over 180 days.

2.1.2.10 Residence requirements

Summary

This topic provides information about the residence requirements for

FA

and includes the following:

general residence requirements

exception to residence requirements for

FTB

exceptions to residence requirements for

CCS

, and

determining whether an individual resides in Australia (

1.1.A.120

).

General residence requirements

To be eligible for FTB and CCS an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must be an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

) or an

SCV

(

1.1.V.10

) holder (New Zealand citizen) residing in Australia, unless one of the exceptions given below in this topic applies.

From 1 January 2019, a

NARWP

applies to FTB Part A. There is no NARWP for FTB Part B. There are a range of exemptions from the NARWP for FTB and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.2.1.10

).

To be eligible for

SBP

under the 6 month income test, an individual must have otherwise been eligible for FTB if the child was not stillborn (disregarding the FTB income test) within 26 weeks starting on the day of the child's delivery. Therefore, the FTB residency requirements detailed in this topic also apply to SBP claimants who are paid under the 6 month SBP income test. Where an SBP claimant does not meet FTB residence requirements under the 6 month SBP income test, they may be eligible to receive SBP if their partner (

1.1.P.30

) is eligible to receive FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil in relation to a day that is within 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery.

For an individual to be an FTB child they must also be an Australian resident or an SCV holder residing in Australia or they must live with an individual who meets the requirements.

To be an Australian resident the individual must not only have the right to live in Australia permanently, they must also be residing in Australia. An Australian citizen, who lives overseas permanently, or indefinitely, is generally not considered to be an Australian resident for FA purposes because they do not currently live in Australia.

As a result of changes to the SSAct on 26 February 2001, SCV holders (those travelling on a New Zealand passport) who arrived after that date no longer meet the definition of Australian resident for social security payments unless they were assessed as having protected SCV status. SCV holders can continue to fulfil the residence requirements for FTB and CCS if they are residing in Australia.

In deciding whether a child is 'living with' the individual for the purposes of the residence requirements, the ordinary meaning of 'living' should be used, that is, residing, dwelling or occupying a place as a domicile. The period of time that the child has been staying with the individual may also be considered. A short period of staying with the child or visiting the child while the child is still residing overseas is not likely to constitute living with the individual.

In deciding whether an individual who is temporarily absent from the child is still living with the child, the decision maker should consider whether the child and the individual still share and live in the same home. If the individual has gone away on a business trip, a holiday or to visit family, generally the individual's home would still be the same as the child's. Generally, such trips away from home would be quite short (up to about 4 weeks) and very finite. However, if the individual has established a new home (for example, has migrated to a new country, returned to live in their country of residence or commenced living overseas on a work posting), the child should not be considered to be living with the individual.

Example 1:

While on a holiday overseas, Ben, who is an Australian resident, commences a relationship with a non-Australian resident who becomes pregnant. Ben returns to Australia prior to the child's birth because his holiday has ended. After the birth, the child remains overseas with her mother while they wait for Australian visas to be issued. At the time, neither the child nor her mother is an Australian resident as they do not hold an appropriate visa and do not reside in Australia.

After the birth of the child, Ben travels back overseas to visit his child for a short period and then returns to Australia leaving the child and her mother overseas. During the period that Ben is overseas, he is regarded as continuing to reside in Australia and to continue to be an Australian resident. During that period, Ben is also regarded as 'living' in Australia, despite being physically absent from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) for a temporary period.

The child is regarded as 'living with' her mother, who is not living in Australia. During the short period of Ben's visit to his child, the child is not regarded as 'living with' Ben as it is a temporary arrangement. In these circumstances the child is not an FTB child of Ben.

Example 2:

John is an Australian citizen whose Australian employer has sent him on a work posting to the

UK

for a period of 2 years. John holds a visa which allows him to work temporarily in the UK. John commences a relationship with Mary who is a UK citizen. Mary gives birth to a child, Anna. John, Mary and Anna commence living together in rental accommodation.

John and Mary plan to move to Australia permanently as soon as John's work posting is finished. Mary applies for a permanent Australian visa for herself and citizenship by descent for Anna, on the basis of their relationship with John.

When Anna is 3 months old, John is required by his employer to attend training in Australia for a period of 2 weeks.

Anna is not an Australian resident because she does not hold an appropriate visa and she is not an Australian citizen. It is likely that John would be considered an Australian resident because he is an Australian citizen, his employment ties are to Australia, he owns a house and other assets in Australia and he plans to commence living permanently with his family in Australia in the near future. Factors to consider when deciding whether an individual is residing in Australia are discussed under 'Determining Australian residence' below.

While John is in the UK, Anna is living with John. When John goes to Australia for 2 weeks to attend training, Anna would probably still be considered to be living with John because his absence from the family home in the UK is only for a short period.

Exception to residence requirements for FTB

The following table shows the circumstances when an individual who is not an Australian resident or an SCV holder (New Zealand citizen) may still be eligible for FTB.

Exception

More detail

The individual is the holder of a visa that qualifies for

SpB

under SSAct section 729(2)(f)(v), and the individual is:

in Australia, or

temporarily absent from Australia for 6 weeks or less and the absence (

1.1.A.05

) is an allowable absence in relation to SpB under SSAct Part 4.2.

Note:

The following visa subclasses generally have a visa travel facility that would enable the holder to be temporarily absent from Australia:

subclass 309 Partner (Provisional)

subclass 820 Partner

subclass 785 (class XD) Temporary Protection*

subclass 790 Safe Haven Enterprise*

Holders of the following visa subclasses qualify for SpB and may therefore meet FTB eligibility requirements, subject to meeting other eligibility criteria:

subclass 309 Partner (Provisional)

subclass 820 Partner

subclass 785 Temporary Protection*

subclass 786 Temporary (Humanitarian Concern)

subclass 790 Safe Haven Enterprise*

subclass 060 Bridging F

subclass 070 Bridging (Removal Pending)

subclass 449 Humanitarian Stay (Temporary)

subclass ZB 951 Criminal Justice Stay Visa (if the CJSV has been issued only for the purpose of assisting in the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence of trafficking in persons, slavery or slavery-like practices).

Note:

The individual does not need to receive SpB to satisfy this exception.

Note:

A NARWP applies to FTB Part A for subclass 309 Partner (Provisional) and subclass 820 (Partner) visa holders (

2.2.1.10

).

Note:

The

CJSV

is no longer issued for the purpose of assisting in the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence of trafficking in persons, slavery or slavery-like practices.

The individual is the holder of a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403), and the person is:

a worker in the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme who has been approved to bring family members to Australia, or

the family member of such a worker.

Workers participating in the PALM scheme who hold a subclass 403 visa and are approved to bring family members to Australia, and family members of these worker, may be eligible for FTB, subject to meeting all other eligibility criteria.

A person is an eligible family member of a PALM worker if they were granted a subclass 403 visa on the basis that they are a member of the PALM worker’s family unit within the meaning of the

Migration Act 1958

. This includes:

a spouse or de facto partner

a child or step-child who is aged up to 18, or who is aged 18 to 23 and is dependent on the PALM worker or their spouse or de facto partner, or who has turned 23 and is dependent on the PALM worker or their spouse or de facto partner due to being incapacitated, and

any dependent child of a child or step-child as described above.

Note:

Subclass 403 visa holders granted under other streams of this visa are not eligible for FTB.

Note:

A NARWP applies to FTB Part A for eligible PALM workers and family members (

2.2.1.10

).

*Subject to approval from the Department of Home Affairs, a subclass 785 (class XD) or 790 visa holder may be eligible to travel overseas and re-enter Australia where the holder can demonstrate compassionate or compelling circumstances.

Determining whether an individual resides in Australia

To be eligible for FTB and CCS an individual must not only be an Australian resident and have the right to live permanently in Australia, but also:

be living in Australia

intend to remain in Australia, or

intend to set up permanent residence in Australia.

SSAct section 7(3) lists the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether a person is residing in Australia. The key point is to establish that Australia is the person's settled or usual place of abode - for example, that the person makes Australia his or her home. It is not generally possible for a person to be residing in more than one country at the same time. In most cases, the balance of a person's ties will weigh more heavily in favour of one country than another. Note that it is just as important to take into account the converse of each factor. The decision as to whether a person is residing in Australia must be based on the balance of all the available evidence. No single factor should be taken to be conclusive on its own.

The SSAct section 7(3) factors, and a brief discussion of each, are:

the nature of the accommodation used by the person in Australia (see Explanation 1)

the nature and extent of the family relationships the person has in Australia (see Explanation 2)

the nature and extent of the person's employment, business or financial ties in Australia

the nature and extent of the person's assets located in Australia (see Explanation 3)

the frequency and duration of the person's travel outside Australia (see Explanation 4)

any other matter relevant to determining whether the person intends to remain permanently in Australia (see Explanation 5 and the example).

Explanation 1:

A mortgage or rental lease in Australia is a good indication that a person is residing here. However, many people do not have such formal living arrangements. The aim is to establish that the person has more settled or permanent accommodation in Australia than in any other country.

Explanation 2:

As well as the nature and extent of the family relationships the person has in Australia, consideration must be given to the nature and extent of any family relationships the person has outside Australia. If the person has a spouse, where does the spouse live? If the person has dependent children, are the children enrolled in school in Australia?

Explanation 3:

Assets such as bank accounts, investments, real estate, a car and furniture are useful indicators. However, care should be taken to ensure that poverty, lack of assets and lack of income are not counted against a person's claim to be residing in Australia.

Explanation 4:

A person does not need to be continuously present in Australia in order to be residing here. A person holidaying, or working temporarily, overseas does not necessarily cease to reside in Australia while they are away. On the other hand, a person who spends more time overseas than in Australia would not usually be considered to be residing in Australia.

Explanation 5:

This last provision is not intended to penalise people who plan to live overseas at some time in the future. It is intended to allow other factors to be taken into account, where relevant. It should be considered in the context of all the other SSAct section

7(3)

factors.

Example:

A return airfare to another country may indicate that a person does not intend to remain permanently in Australia, whereas a one-way ticket may indicate that a person intends to stay. However, such a factor should not be taken, of itself, to be conclusive evidence of a person's intentions.

The factors that would be relevant would depend on the circumstances of each case. A combination of these factors should be considered for a particular case. No one factor is likely to be enough to decide whether a person is, or is not, a resident. Considering the circumstances of each case and having applied the guidelines given above and if satisfactory answers have been provided then the person can be considered to be residing in Australia or as intending to reside permanently or indefinitely in Australia. Once a decision is taken that a person is residing in Australia and payment is granted, and subsequently when reviewed it is found that they have not made sufficient efforts to permanently reside in Australia as implied at the time of claim, then their entitlements to FTB and CCS may be stopped. SBP cannot be stopped, as it would have already been issued in full.

On a review if there is sufficient evidence to support the fact that an individual never intended to reside in Australia, FTB, SBP and CCS paid to the person may be a debt to the Commonwealth from the date of grant.

7.3.2 Waiver of debts

Introduction

This section contains information about the circumstances in which the recovery of debts (

1.1.D.60

) to the Commonwealth may be waived (

1.1.W.10

).

The recovery of a debt may be waived only under the specific circumstances that are covered in topics in this section.

Date of effect for waiving a debt

A debt waiver takes effect on the day:

specified in the decision, or

the day the decision is made if there is no date specified.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 96 Power to waive Commonwealth's right to recover debt

Effect of waiver

When a decision has been made to waive a debt or part of a debt, no further recovery action on the waived amount can be taken.

Note:

The decision to waive a debt is subject to review. If, upon review, the decision to waive the debt is set aside and substituted with a new decision, the (previously waived) debt may be recoverable.

If Centrelink's intention is to defer the recovery of a debt, the debt must be written-off instead.

1.1.P.110 Presumption of parentage (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, presumption of parentage is based on the assumption that the person being asked to provide child support (

1.1.C.20

) is a parent of the child.

Example:

1.1.I.80 Indexation

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, indexation means periodically adjusting payments and thresholds in line with

CPI

increases. Movement in the CPI is measured quarterly and increases from indexation occur once a year for most payments and thresholds, although the rate of

RA

for

FTB

is indexed twice a year.

Note:

On occasion, some of the FA payment rates and thresholds are paused, so indexation is not applied (for further details see

3.1.1.60

).

1.1.V.10 Visa

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, a visa is an authority to travel to and remain in a country. Australian visas may allow a person to remain in Australia (

1.1.A.120

) temporarily or permanently.

Increasing amounts of the Department of Home Affairs' services no longer involve the physical exchange of paper forms and letters and alternatively encourage the use of online immigration services.

Australian visas are recorded electronically and the Australian Government no longer requires visa holders to have an Australian visa label in their passport. Most non-citizens of Australia who now travel to and reside in Australia do not have visa labels in their passports.

Online visa verification provides more timely and secure information as to the entitlements of a visa holder.

Some visa holders may continue to present with a printed visa label affixed to their passport.

2.6.6.10 CCS - only one individual eligible for the same session of care

Summary

CCS

can only be paid once for a child for the same session of care (

1.1.S.40

) at the same approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

). If more than one individual (

1.1.I.90

) enrols the same child at the same child care service (for example, separated parents (

1.1.P.10

) who are both CCS claimants for the child) and the service charges both parents for the same session, only one parent can be eligible to receive CCS for that session of care.

Approved child care services should not submit the same session of care twice under 2 enrolments (

1.1.E.25

) for the same child. If a service does do this, CCS will be paid to the individual whose session is submitted first.

Example:

Approved child care services cannot use CCS to 'hold' a place for a child in shared care situations. If a service submits an absence (

1.1.A.05

) under one enrolment and an attendance under the other, for the same session of care and the same child, only one individual can be eligible to receive CCS for that session of care. The service can decide whether to charge one or both parents for the session of care, but the service will receive CCS on behalf of one parent only for the session of care.

Only one individual can be eligible for a session of care, even where a child is absent due to a court order in place that requires the child to be cared for by someone other than their usual carer, as described in CCSMinRules section 6(1)(b).

Example:

Mary and Jack are separated parents who share care of their child Esther. They have already received CCS for 42 absence days for Esther in the financial year, so any further absence days will attract CCS only where they are taken for an 'additional absence' (

1.1.A.17

) reason. A court order states Esther must be in Jack's care on a day she usually attends a session of care booked under Mary's enrolment. Jack books Esther in for a casual session on that day. The service will not receive CCS if they submit an additional absence for the session of care in Mary's enrolment, even though the reason is one prescribed in

FA

law. In this circumstance, CCS can still only be paid once, for one session of care for Esther on that day.

This provision does not apply if more than one session of care is reported for a child at the same time by different services.

5.2.1.40 CCS & ACCS - change in participation/income

Summary

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) is required to notify Centrelink when there is a change in their circumstances and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) if they have one, that affects their

CCS

or

ACCS

entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) as soon as practicable.

This topic covers:

change in combined annual estimated

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

)

change in recognised participation.

Change in combined annual estimated ATI

A change in the combined annual estimated ATI for an individual and their partner, if they have one, affects the individual's CCS applicable percentage (

1.1.A.70

). Updating their combined annual estimated ATI ensures future payments are calculated based on up to date information and reduces the risk of debt (1.1.D.60).

An individual must notify Centrelink, as soon as practicable, if there is a change in the individual's and/or their partner's, if they have one, income, for example when starting a new job or reducing their work hours.

When an individual provides a new combined annual estimated ATI, it will be applied from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) after the change is notified.

If an individual reports a change to their combined annual estimated ATI after the change occurred, a review of the CCS applicable percentage paid for past periods is not undertaken until reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

) occurs.

Change in recognised participation

A change in an individual's recognised participation, and their partner's, if they have one, can affect the hours of subsidised care the individual is entitled to per fortnight. Updating their recognised participation ensures future payments are calculated based on up to date information and reduces the risk of debt (

1.1.D.60

).

An individual must notify Centrelink, as soon as practicable, if there is a change in their own or their partner's, if they have one, recognised participation that would cause their subsidised hours result to change.

If an individual reports a change in their recognised participation, or their partner’s, if they have one, before the change has occurred, the new subsidised hours result will take effect from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight after the change occurs.

If the individual reports a change in their recognised participation, or their partner’s, if they have one, after the change has occurred, the change will take effect from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight after the change was notified. A review of entitlement for the past period will usually be undertaken and the outcome will be held over until reconciliation occurs.

An individual must also notify Centrelink, as soon as practicable, if there is a change in their circumstances or their partner’s, if they have one, that would mean they are no longer eligible for an exemption, or would now be eligible for an exemption to reporting participation details (

3.5.2.20

).

Example:

Charlotte had reported she was undertaking 40 hours of unpaid work experience per fortnight and 10 hours of paid work per fortnight - a total of 50 hours of recognised participation per fortnight. When Charlotte finishes the unpaid work experience, she must report this change as it will cause her subsidised result to move from 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight to 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight.

4.2.3.30 Giving the individual notice of the determination

Notice of determination

Once the

FTB

claim has been determined, a notice must be given to the applicant (

1.1.A.72

) that advises them of the result. Where the FTB claim included a combination of claim types, the result of the determination of each claim type must be included. The main information included in the letter is:

whether the claim has been granted or rejected, and

if the claim has been rejected, the reason for the rejection, or

if the claim has been granted

the period of entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) for a past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) or bereavement claim (

1.1.B.20

)

the date of commencement of entitlement for an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

), and their payment delivery day (

1.1.P.73

)

the rate of FTB, and

if there are changes to entitlement during the period covered by the claim/s, any variations to entitlement, and

the applicant’s review rights under FA(Admin)Act Part 5 (see FA(Admin)Act paragraph 22(1)(c)).

Example:

Toni makes a claim for FTB for a combination of a past period and an instalment claim. In the period between lodging the claim and before the claim is determined, Toni's only FTB child leaves their care. Toni notifies Centrelink immediately. When Toni's eligibility is assessed, a determination is made that they are entitled to receive FTB for the past period, and are entitled to receive arrears for the FTB instalment claim for the period since the claim was lodged up to the date the child left care. There is no entitlement to ongoing instalments of FTB. The letter notifying Toni of the determination must include this information.

4.13.2.30 CCS - arrangement with an organisation enrolment

Summary

'Arrangement with an organisation' enrolments (

1.1.E.25

) are created when a third party, other than the child's parent (

1.1.P.10

) or guardian is liable for the fees for care of the child (for example, the parent's employer, a government agency - such as for participants in the

AMEP

, or other organisation).

Sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) submitted under an arrangement with an organisation are not eligible for

CCS

.

Providers should submit an enrolment notice if they enter into an arrangement with an organisation to provide care to a child, although less information is needed than for a

CWA

enrolment (

4.13.2.10

). Arrangement with organisation enrolments do not require a parent or child

CRN

(as there is no need to link to the individual's eligibility and entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) information), or details of routine sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) and usual fees. They also do not require parent confirmation with Centrelink.

It is possible for an individual to have liability under a CWA for the cost of some sessions of care, and an organisation (for example, their employer) to be paying for other sessions of care. In these cases, a provider can create 2 enrolments for the child, a CWA enrolment and an arrangement with an organisation enrolment. A provider needs to submit the relevant sessions into each enrolment.

4.1.1.70 TFN requirements for SBP

TFN

must be provided

An individual cannot be paid

SBP

until the individual satisfies the TFN requirement for SBP.

To satisfy the TFN requirements for SBP, an individual must provide either:

their TFN, if they have one and know what it is, or

permission to use the TFN previously provided to Centrelink, or

a statement that they have a TFN but do not know what it is, and

they have asked the Commissioner of Taxation to inform them of the TFN, and

authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to provide their TFN to Centrelink, or

a statement that they do not have a TFN, and have applied for a TFN, and authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to

provide the TFN to Centrelink, or

advise Centrelink if the application for a TFN is refused, or

advise Centrelink if the application for a TFN has been withdrawn by the claimant.

If the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) at the time of the claim, their partner must also provide a TFN or a TFN statement. If the individual is unable to provide their partner's TFN or a TFN statement, Centrelink may grant an exemption from the TFN requirements.

Declining to provide a TFN statement is not an offence, but the applicant's SBP claim may not be effective or their SBP payment may cease to be payable if a TFN statement is not provided.

Claims for SBP

Exemption from TFN requirements for an SBP claim made in normal circumstances

In some circumstances, an individual may be granted an exemption from the requirement to provide the TFN or TFN statement of their partner, who is also a TFN claim person (

1.1.T.50

), when claiming SBP in normal circumstances.

There may be situations where an individual cannot satisfy the TFN requirement because they cannot obtain a relevant statement from the partner.

Before granting an exemption from the TFN requirements, Centrelink must take into account the specific circumstances of the individual.

Centrelink may decide to grant an exemption from the TFN requirements if the individual has a sound reason to believe that if the partner were approached for a relevant statement:

they would be subject to violence from the partner, or

there are other concerns for the safety of the individual, or a child of the individual.

Other situations where Centrelink may also decide to grant an individual an exemption from the requirement to provide their partner's TFN or a TFN statement includes, but is not limited to, circumstances where the partner is:

imprisoned

seriously ill or disabled

not contactable, or

missing and their whereabouts are unknown.

The evidence required to support Centrelink's decision to exempt an individual's partner from providing their TFN or a TFN statement would depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Centrelink may request evidence from the individual such as travel documents, medical evidence, or a statutory declaration. Evidence from a social worker may be required in some circumstances, for example, where the partner is violent.

3.1.11 Advance payment of FTB Part A

Introduction

The amount of

FTB

advance payable to an individual is the smaller of the amount sought by the individual and the maximum amount of advance payable minus the original amount of any previous unrepaid FTB advances.

Alternatively, an FTB advance amount can be determined at the discretion of the Secretary. This amount has to be more than the minimum amount and less than the maximum amount and/or the amount sought by the individual.

Minimum (

1.1.M.55

) and maximum (

1.1.M.25

) FTB advance amounts are determined with reference to a family's instalment rate of FTB Part A, excluding the FTB Part A supplement, and before any existing advance rate reductions payable to the family on the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

).

For a detailed explanation of the maximum FTB advance amount available to an individual see

1.1.M.25

.

For a detailed explanation of the minimum FTB advance amount available to an individual see

1.1.M.55

.

Blended families

A blended family's maximum advance amount will be calculated as a whole as above, and then each individual will be able to claim their blended family percentage of this maximum (that is, the individual's blended family percentage of the family's maximum advance becomes the individual's maximum advance). Similarly, the blended family percentage of the family's minimum advance becomes the individual's minimum advance.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.80

FTB in blended families

Discretion of the Secretary

The Secretary may determine that a lower amount of FTB advance is to be paid if the Secretary is satisfied that the individual would suffer financial hardship if their Part A rate were reduced to repay the greater amount.

An example is where the repayment period (

1.1.R.33

) of the advance is known to be shorter than 182 days because the individual's eligibility for FTB will cease at an earlier time, such as if their only child will cease to be an FTB child (

2.1.1.10

) due to their age.

Other circumstances which may impact the advance amount and/or eligibility include (but are not limited to) where an individual advises Centrelink of an event which will impact on their eligibility in the future, such as:

the individual advises Centrelink that they will be absent from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) permanently at a particular future date

the child has pre-claimed

YA

when they are about to turn 18 or complete secondary study, or

a carer will have less than 35% of the care of a child from a particular date onwards, etc.

Example:

Martin is eligible for a maximum $500.00 advance based on his rate of FTB Part A. However, the payment is scheduled to be cancelled in 100 days as he is leaving Australia permanently, so the repayment period is 100 days instead of 182 days. It is considered that the daily repayment of $5.00 ($500.00 ÷ 100) would result in financial hardship, but the equivalent daily repayment for $500.00 over 182 days would not cause financial hardship.

Therefore, exercising the discretion, the maximum advance amount would be $500.00 ÷ 182 × 100 = $274.72. As this is greater than the minimum amount, the advance of $274.72 would be granted. The daily repayment over 100 days would be $274.72 ÷ 100, which is the equivalent daily repayment to what would be applied if he repaid $500.00 over 182 days.

If the Secretary is to exercise this discretion, the advance amount must be at least the minimum amount.

In the example above, if the maximum advance based on Martin's rate of FTB Part A was $250.00, the advance would not be granted as $250.00 ÷ 182 × 100 = $137.36, which is less than the minimum amount.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 35C Amount of FTB advance

Reduction in advance amount due to repayment of a previous advance

If a previous advance is being repaid when an individual requests a new FTB advance, the maximum advance amount for the new FTB advance is reduced by the original amount of any unrepaid FTB advance. This reduced amount would need to be at least the minimum amount in order for the individual to qualify for a new advance.

Example:

Tony is eligible for a maximum $1,000.00 advance based on his current FTB Part A rate. He claims a $400.00 advance. During the repayment period for the $400.00 advance he requests a further advance. As Tony has not yet fully repaid the $400.00 advance, the maximum amount available to him at this point in time is his maximum advance amount ($1,000.00), reduced by the original amount of any advance/s he has not fully repaid ($400.00). Therefore, his maximum advance amount at the time of the second request is $600.00.

Note:

For the purposes of calculating an individual's maximum advance amount as above, outstanding advances with balances of less than 5c are disregarded. Disregarding an advance with a remaining balance of less than 5c allows the original amount of the outstanding advance to become available again, despite the remaining balance not being recovered until the individual's next FTB instalment payment.

Advance ceiling

The advance ceiling is the absolute maximum advance amount that an individual may be able to receive. It is set at 23.3% of the maximum standard rate for one child aged under 13.

3.1.1.34 Sharing FTB for separated couples

Summary

Two people who have separated can both claim

FTB

for a past period (

1.1.P.60

) while they were still a couple (

1.1.M.50

) if both of them are eligible for FTB for their child.

Example:

Brad and Rebecca have separated. While they were still a couple they shared the caring responsibilities for their children. After separation they both lodge a lump sum claim for FTB for their children for the past period during which they were still a couple. The children are FTB children of both Brad and Rebecca for the past period as:

they both provided daily care for the children, and

both were legally responsible for the children.

This does not apply if one member of the couple has been paid FTB for a past period while the couple were together.

Example:

On 2 March Melissa separated from her husband David. Prior to this Melissa received fortnightly payments of FTB for their 3 children. At the end of the financial year, David lodges a past period claim for FTB for the period 1 July to 1 March. David's claim for FTB is rejected because Melissa had claimed and received FTB for the period when they were a couple. David received the benefit of this payment when they were a family unit.

Determining a claim for FTB received prior to or after separation

Whether 2 people are eligible for FTB (based on the period they were a couple) when a claim for FTB is lodged depends on the date of determination for that claim. If a determination is made prior to separation then the individual is eligible for FTB. However, if a determination is made after separation then both the individual and ex-partner are eligible for FTB.

Example:

On 3 November Angela lodges a lump sum claim for FTB for the previous income year. On 7 November Angela separates from her husband. Centrelink receive Angela's claim and makes a determination on 10 November that both Angela and her husband are entitled to FTB for the previous income year. If Centrelink had received the claim and made the determination on 6 November, Angela would receive the full FTB payment.

Sharing FTB between 2 people who have separated, for a past period while they were still a couple

A determination under FAAct section 29 must be made specifying the percentage of care that each person provided for their FTB child. The effect of the determination is to divide the total rate that would have been payable to one member of the former couple between both parties. Because the claim relates to a past period when they were a couple, the FTB income tests are applied using the

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of both individuals for the period.

Explanation:

This means that the total rate of FTB payable for the children is the same as the rate that would have been paid if the couple had not separated.

However, it is not appropriate to apply a determination under FAAct section 29, that is to pay both the individual and ex-partner, where one person has been paid when the couple were still together. An ex-partner's claim for FTB should be rejected in this case.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 29 Eligibility for FTB of separated members of a couple for period before separation, section 61 Sharing FTB between separated members of a couple for period before separation

Percentage of care for a past period

The individuals can agree on the percentage of care they each had for their FTB child prior to their separation, providing the percentages add to 100%. If the individuals have not agreed on the percentage of care for that time, an assessment of their actual care arrangements for the period must be made. Generally this assessment would be determined as being a 50% arrangement for each member of the couple on the grounds that they shared care as an intact couple.

The percentage of care is rounded to the nearest whole per cent. The percentage is applied to the total rate that is payable to arrive at the amount payable to each individual.

Multiply the total rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B by the percentage of care for each of the individuals. The result is the FTB rate payable to each person for the past period.

4.3.1.25 ES payment choices

Summary

This topic outlines the payment choices available for

ES

. It covers:

delivery choices for individuals who receive

FTB

by instalments

quarterly ES payments option, and

FTB More Choice for Families.

Note:

The ES ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

Delivery choices for individuals who receive FTB by instalments

Generally, individuals who receive FTB by instalments can choose to receive their FTB payments fortnightly through Centrelink or defer payment of some or all of their FTB until the end of the income (financial) year.

ES generally aligns with FTB, and can be received as a fortnightly instalments. However, individuals are given an additional option to receive their ES on a quarterly basis.

All individuals will default to fortnightly instalments of the ES if a different choice is not made.

Individuals who receive ES by quarterly instalment

If an individual is receiving FTB by instalments, regardless of their FTB payment choice, they may elect to receive their ES payment on a quarterly basis. Individuals cannot make a different election for ES Part A and ES Part B.

Individuals may elect to receive ES on a quarterly basis at any time. Quarters commence on 1 July, 1 October, 1 January and 1 March of each year. Any election to receive ES as a quarterly payment will come in force as soon as practicable following the decision.

If the individual has a quarterly payment choice in place, the ES payment will not be made before the end of the quarter unless:

the decision to receive ES as a quarterly payment is revoked by the individual

the individual's FTB entitlement is cancelled, or

the individual is entitled to a lump sum bereavement payment.

In all these cases, the election will end as soon as practical and Centrelink will make an arrears payment of the ES to the individual. In the case of a lump sum bereavement payment, a new election cannot be made until the end of the bereavement period (

3.1.1.40

).

FTB More Choice for Families

More Choice for Families gives families more choice and flexibility in how their FTB is paid (

4.3.1.10

). ES payments align with More Choice for Families payment choices. Where FTB Part A is deferred, ES Part A will be deferred. Where FTB Part B is deferred, ES Part B will be deferred. Where an individual has made a quarterly ES payment election, this will interact with More Choice for Families choices. If a deferral is in place, the quarterly ES will also be deferred.

Example:

Tim receives FTB for one child and has just had their second child. Tim's employment is steady and they have confidently estimated that their income for the current income year will be $51,000. Tim’s partner, Emma, currently has no income but is thinking about returning to work part-time later in the income year and has estimated their income to be $5,000. Tim will need to notify Centrelink of Emma’s ATI if Emma is not required to lodge an income tax return.

Tim and Emma know they will be entitled to FTB Part A but, are unsure if they will be entitled to FTB Part B because Emma might return to work before the end of the income year. They opt for Choice 2 under the 'More Choice for Families' FTB payment choices. Their payments arrangements will be as follows:

Tim and Emma will receive all of their FTB Part A as fortnightly payments.

Their ES Part A will be paid at the end of each quarter.

They will be assessed for any entitlement to FTB Part B and the supplements after the end of the income year when Emma's actual ATI is known. If they are entitled to FTB Part B, their ES Part B will also be paid at that time.

1.1.I.85 Indexed income - actual or estimate (FTB)

Summary

The income on which an individual's

FTB

is assessed will be either:

an estimate provided by the individual that is assessed as being reasonable by Centrelink

the indexed estimate

the indexed actual income.

Indexed estimates and indexed actual incomes only apply where an instalment determination is in force.

Estimates provided by individuals

Individuals claiming FTB may be assessed on their own

ATI

estimate if it is considered 'reasonable' by Centrelink. Individuals receiving payment on the basis of an indexed estimate or indexed actual income may choose to provide their own estimate in place of the indexed amount at any time, if it is considered to be reasonable by Centrelink.

Indexed estimate

Where the actual income amount is not known, the estimate held by Centrelink will be indexed by the indexation factor and used as a basis for payment. To calculate the new indexed estimate:

multiply the individual's current estimated ATI by the indexation factor (

1.1.I.82

)

round the result to the nearest dollar, and

round 50c upwards.

Note:

A notice under FA(Admin)Act subsection 20A(2) or subsection 20B(2) advising recipients of the income amount that will be used to assess their current or next financial year's payment may be issued to recipients:

when granted payment

when their circumstances change

when their or their partner's ATI is known, or

as part of the new financial year assessment (NFYA) process.

The income amount specified in the notice will be applied to a recipient's rate at least 14 days after the day on which the notice is given.

Indexed actual income

The indexed actual income is calculated by:

multiplying the individual's last known actual income by the indexation factor

rounding the result to the nearest dollar, and

rounding 50c upwards.

This is only applicable to recipients whose payments are based on an indexed estimate or an indexed actual income and should only be used where the new indexed actual income (based on ATI for the most recent income year) is higher than the indexed estimate or indexed actual income currently being used to determine their FTB rate.

1.1.M.10 Maintenance (FTB)

Definition: maintenance

Maintenance refers to payments or benefits received by an individual for the upkeep of an

FTB

child that is received from:

a parent of the child, or

the partner or former partner of a parent of the child.

Maintenance may include child maintenance (including child support), direct child maintenance and partner (spousal) maintenance.

Maintenance can be received in the form of cash (periodic and lump sum payments), non-cash maintenance, or capitalised maintenance.

Definition: maintenance income

Maintenance income in relation to an individual means:

child maintenance - the amount of a payment or the value of a benefit that is received by the individual for the maintenance of an FTB child of the individual and is received from

a parent of the child, or

the partner or former partner of a parent of the child

partner (spousal) maintenance - the amount of a payment or the value of a benefit that is received by the individual for the individual's own maintenance and is received from the individual's former partner, or

direct child maintenance - the amount of a payment or the value of a benefit that is received by an FTB child of the individual for the child's own maintenance and is received from

a parent of the child, or

the partner or former partner of a parent of the child

but does not include disability expenses maintenance.

Act reference:

FAAct

Definition: capitalised maintenance income

Capitalised maintenance income in relation to an individual means maintenance income of the individual:

that is neither a periodic amount nor a benefit provided on a periodic basis, and

the amount or value of which exceeds $1,500.00.

A capitalised maintenance amount reflects a capitalisation period, which is the period of time the capitalised maintenance is meant to be used. Capitalised maintenance can be a single transfer of cash or property, but does not include property awarded to a non-resident parent as part of a matrimonial property settlement.

Capitalised maintenance income does not include maintenance income that is annualised or received under a notional assessment as set out in FAAct Schedule 1 clauses 20B, 20C and 20D.

6.4.2.20 Income test exemptions for individuals in receipt of income support

Summary

This topic outlines how

FTB

Part A and FTB Part B are exempt from the income test for

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for periods during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) when an individual (

1.1.I.90

) and/or their partner receive income support payments.

Exempting periods on income support - FTB Part A

Amounts of FTB Part A paid during a period when an individual and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) receive an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) at a rate above nil are not subject to income reconciliation. For these periods, the individual is generally entitled to the maximum rate of FTB Part A. However, the individual's FTB Part A rate may still be reduced by the application of the

MIT

(

3.1.7

) and the

MAT

(

3.1.5

) during these periods.

Note:

FTB Part A remains subject to the income test for any periods that the individual is serving an employment income nil rate period and their rate of income support is nil.

Example:

Boris and Natasha have a 14 year old son and do not pay rent. For the first 70 days of the 2011-12 income year, Boris received newstart allowance at a rate above nil and FTB Part A at the maximum rate. For the other 295 days of the year, Boris and Natasha's estimated ATI of $47,000 applies.

Based on 70 days at the maximum rate, 295 days at an income tested rate, an estimated ATI of $47,000, and one child aged 14, Boris will be paid:

A: 70 days at the maximum rate = $5,580.85 ÷ 365 × 70 = $1,070.30

B: 295 days at the income tested rate = ($47,000 − $46,355) × 0.2 = $129.00

C: $5,580.85 − $129.00 = $5,451.85

D: $5,451.85 ÷ 365 × 295 = $4,406.29

Explanation of the above calculation:

A: FTB Part A entitlement for 70 days = (maximum rate ÷ 365) × 70

B: FTB Part A entitlement for 295 days = (ATI − FTB Part A lower income free area) × 0.2

C: Maximum rate − B

D: (C ÷ 365) × 295

Boris receives $1,070.30 for the first 70 days of the income year and $4,406.29 for the remaining 295 days. Altogether, Boris receives $5,476.59 for the entire income year.

Where an individual enters an employment income nil rate period relating to their income support payment, their FTB Part A is no longer exempt from the income test.

Exempting periods on income support - FTB Part B

FTB Part B is exempt from the primary earner income test for any period that an individual and/or their partner receive an income support payment (see

3.1.9.20

for details on the primary earner income test). Therefore, the primary earner is 'quarantined' for the income test during this time.

However, for any periods of the income year that the individual and their partner do not receive an income support payment, the primary earner income test must be met. For the purposes of the income test, the primary earner's ATI for the entire income year is considered, including any income support payments received. If the primary earner's ATI is above the primary earner income limit, the family is not eligible for FTB Part B during any period the primary earner or their partner did not receive an income support payment.

Example:

Sam and Olivia have 2 children under the age of 5. From July to August 2020, Sam receives income support totalling about $1,600. On 1 September, Sam starts a new job earning an income that is above the FTB Part B primary earner income limit for the year. During the period July to August, the primary earner income test does not apply because Sam was receiving income support. This means that during the period July to August, the family eligibility for FTB Part B will be assessed under the secondary earner income test only. However, during the period September to June, the primary earner income test applies because Sam was not receiving income support. This means that the family is not eligible for FTB Part B during this period because Sam's ATI for the income year, including earned income and income support, is above the FTB Part B primary earner income limit.

Note:

The secondary earner income test for FTB Part B applies regardless of whether the primary earner or secondary earner is receiving an income support payment. (See

3.1.9.20

for details on the secondary earner income test.)

Eligibility for the FTB Part A supplement

While an FTB Part A recipient who is also receiving an income support payment at a rate above nil is able to receive the maximum rate of FTB Part A free of the income test, an income test still applies to the FTB Part A supplement (

6.4.1.30

).

1.4.1 Beneficial administration of the Act

What is beneficial legislation?

Legislation is characterised as 'beneficial' when its purpose is to provide benefits to those affected. The

FAAct

is regarded as beneficial legislation because it provides assistance to families with children. This means where legislative ambiguities arise in the Act, the legislation should be interpreted in a way that is most beneficial to individuals as a whole.

When is the beneficial approach applied?

A beneficial approach can only be applied where the legislation is unclear and there are no policy directives on how the relevant section of the legislation should be interpreted. Consideration must be given as to whether a particular interpretation would be beneficial to most individuals. Once a favourable interpretation has been made that approach is to be adopted in all cases. Therefore, it is not possible to apply different interpretations on a case-by-case basis once a beneficial interpretation has been determined for that piece of legislation.

1.1.R.10 Reconciliation (CCS)

Definition

For the purposes of

CCS

, reconciliation (also known as balancing) of entitlement occurs when the CCS claimant meets the reconciliation conditions. Reconciliation involves reviewing CCS weekly entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) decisions for an individual (

1.1.I.90

) for an income year. Reconciliation can only occur once an individual (and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) or partners) has settled their tax affairs, usually by lodging a tax return, or notifying Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

The primary information used for the reconciliation process for CCS includes:

the individual's (and any partners) ATI (

1.1.A.20

) (usually supplied by the

ATO

), and

session reports (

1.1.S.35

) submitted by approved providers for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided in the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

).

An individual's ongoing entitlement and eligibility for CCS is affected where they do not meet the reconciliation conditions by certain times. Reconciliation ensures individuals have received their correct entitlement for the relevant income year. If an individual has been underpaid, Centrelink will credit a top-up payment to their nominated bank account. If they have been overpaid, Centrelink will contact them to make recovery arrangements.

1.1.G.14 Grandparent (CCS, ACCS)

Definition

For the purposes of the

CCS

and

ACCS

(grandparent), a grandparent or great-grandparent is defined as an individual (

1.1.I.90

) who:

has a biological grandparent or great-grandparent relationship to the child, or

is a grandparent or great-grandparent as a result of:

adoption

step-parent relationships (including former partners)

artificial conception procedures

de facto relationships, and

surrogacy arrangements.

Example:

James and Shelley are the biological parents of their child Seth. James and Shelley separate and James marries Martina. Martina is Seth's step-parent. In later years Seth marries Sarah and they have a child Nathan. Martina is the step-grandparent of Nathan. Seth and Sarah eventually separate and Seth marries Helga. Helga is Nathan's step-parent and Helga's mother and father are Nathan's step-grandparents.

Example:

Layla is the biological mother of Katharine. Layla dies and her cousin Danielle takes on the care of Katharine as her guardian, when Katharine is 3 years old. In later years, Katharine has a child Bernie. Danielle is not considered the grandparent of Bernie because she is not the natural, adoptive or step-grandparent of Bernie.

4.2.2.30 Specific requirements for bereavement claim

Introduction

A bereavement claim (

1.1.B.20

) for

FTB

can be made:

in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for FTB, or

for a deceased FTB or regular care child.

Note:

FTB is not payable for a deceased regular care child. However, the applicant may be entitled to receive other government benefits including

RA

.

A claim in substitution for a deceased person may also include a bereavement claim for a child if the deceased person was entitled to a bereavement payment for their FTB child that was not paid.

Example:

Jocelyn and her child Phillip were involved in a car accident. Phillip died immediately and Jocelyn died 2 weeks later. Jocelyn never claimed FTB as she had intended to make a past period claim. Jocelyn's husband is able to make a claim for FTB in substitution for his wife's entitlement prior to Phillip's death, and also for the bereavement payment for Phillip.

4.4.6 Income support claim pending for FTB or regular care child

Pending claim

A reassessment of an individual or

ACO

’s

FTB

entitlement is required where an FTB or regular care child of the individual or ACO makes a claim for a:

social security pension (

1.1.S.90

) or benefit (

1.1.S.60

)

LMP

(

1.1.L.10

) payment, or

prescribed educational scheme (

1.1.P.100

) payment where the child is aged 16 or more.

To ensure that no FTB is paid for a child who has claimed one of the specified payments, Centrelink must:

cancel the individual or ACO's FTB entitlement if the child is the individual's only FTB or regular care child, or

vary the daily rate of the individual or ACO's FTB entitlement.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28B Variation of instalment entitlement determination where claim made for another payment type

Date of effect of cancellation or rate reduction

The date of effect of the FTB cancellation or rate reduction determination is the day after the end of the last instalment period before the variation takes place (date paid to plus one) or at a later date as determined by the Secretary (for example, the FTB or regular care child’s 16th birthday where they make an early claim for the specified payment).

Example:

Martin receives FTB for 2 children. The older child, Hendrik, is aged 17 and makes a claim for YA. The Secretary varies Martin’s FTB rate so that it does not take Hendrik into account from the day that Hendrik made the claim for YA.

Example:

Leiz receives FTB for one child, Tess. Tess makes an early claim for DSP 13 weeks before their 16th birthday. The Secretary cancels Leiz’s FTB on Tess’ 16th birthday.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28B(2) Consequence of section applying if the individual is the claimant's only FTB or regular care child or the claimant is an approved care organisation, section 28B(3) Consequence of section applying if the individual is not the claimant's only FTB or regular care child

Child's claim rejected

If the FTB or regular care child's claim for the specified payment is rejected, withdrawn or taken not to have been made, the Secretary must vary individual or ACO’s FTB rate to undo the effect of the cancellation or rate reduction determination. The date of effect of this variation is the date of effect of the FTB cancellation or rate reduction. The variation restores the determination that applied before the cancellation or rate reduction.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28B(4) Consequence of later rejection etc. of individual's claim

Claim rejected for reason that would affect FTB entitlement

If the FTB or regular care child's claim for the specified payment was rejected, withdrawn or taken not to have been made, because of a personal circumstance that would affect the individual's FTB eligibility for that child, the individual or ACO’s FTB must be varied from the date the change in the child's circumstances occurred.

3.1.7.30 Application of the maintenance income test

Summary

Maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) income for both instalment (

1.1.I.100

) and past period claims (

1.1.P.60

) is assessed for the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) during the financial year to work out the individual's rate of

FTB

Part A. Maintenance income is estimated for individuals receiving instalments during the financial year. For past period claims, the actual amount of maintenance income received for the relevant income year is used.

The amount of maintenance income to be assessed is converted to an annualised amount before applying the maintenance income test.

Note:

If the relevant period is the full financial year, the annualised amount is the full amount received in that financial year. If the relevant period is only part of the financial year, the formula annualises the amount.

Annualising maintenance income (other than capitalised maintenance)

The annualised amount of maintenance income is calculated using the following formula:

Amount received in relevant period × (Number of days in the financial year / Number of days in relevant period)

Example:

If $1,000 is received over 70 days, the annualised amount is:

$1,000 × (365 ÷ 70) = $5,214.28

For the purposes of applying the maintenance income test, a financial year is always 365 days, including leap years.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20A Annualised amount of maintenance income

Annualising capitalised maintenance

The appropriate period in an income year for annualising capitalised maintenance income is the part of the capitalisation period that falls within the financial year. The capitalised maintenance income is apportioned using the following formula:

Amount of Capitalised Maintenance Income × (Number of days in the capitalisation period in the income year ÷ Total number of days in the capitalisation period).

Example:

Joanne receives $6,000 capitalised maintenance on 1 March. The capitalisation period is 600 days. The period from 1 March to the end of the income year on 30 June is 122 days so the apportioned amount of maintenance for that period is:

$6,000 × (122 ÷ 600) = $1,220.

The annualised amount for the income year is:

Apportioned amount × (Number of days in the income year ÷ Number of days in the capitalisation period in the income year)

$1,220 × (365 ÷ 122) = $3,650.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24 Apportionment of capitalised maintenance income

Applying the maintenance income test

Only assessable maintenance is taken into account under the maintenance income test. Generally, the maintenance income test for FTB Part A is applied as demonstrated in the table below.

Step

Action

1

Work out the individual's annualised maintenance income.

2

Work out the individual's

MIFA

(

1.1.M.21

).

3

Subtract the MIFA from the annualised maintenance income amount. The result is the maintenance income excess.

If the result is negative or nil, the individual's maintenance income excess is nil, and their FTB Part A rate is not reduced for maintenance income.

If the result is positive, go to Step 4.

4

Divide the maintenance income excess by 2 (as the maintenance income excess reduces FTB by 50%). The result is the individual's reduction for maintenance income.

The reduction for maintenance income is applied when calculating the rate of FTB Part A.

Maintenance income test ceiling

Where there are child support children and non-child support children in the family; or the payee has 2 or more child support cases, a maintenance income test (MIT) ceiling (

1.1.M.22

) must first be determined. The maintenance income is then compared to the MIT ceiling and the lower of the 2 is used in the MIT calculation. The MIT ceiling calculation is explained in

3.1.7.03

.

4.6.1.10 CCS - making an effective claim

Summary

This topic contains information on an individual (

1.1.I.90

) claiming

CCS

for approved care (

1.1.A.90

) and covers:

when a claim (

1.1.C.27

) is effective

claims that are not effective

information required to make an effective claim.

When is a claim effective?

To make an effective claim for CCS by fee reduction, individuals must:

submit a CCS claim form with all relevant questions answered through Centrelink online, in person or over the phone, and

submit all relevant supporting documentation (if required).

Where an individual has provided documentary evidence or 'free text' information (for example, in relation to an application for exceptional circumstances) to support their online CCS claim, it will be manually assessed to determine if it is effective.

If the claim is effective the individual will receive an acknowledgement in writing of receipt of the claim.

Claims that are not effective

If a claim is not effective, it considered not to have been made, will not be assessed, and no CCS payments can be made. The individual will receive a notification in writing, which will include the reason it was not effective.

Claims that are not effective are also considered not to have been made for the purposes of review and appeal.

Information required when claiming CCS

Information individuals must provide to make an effective claim includes:

personal details for themselves and their partner (

1.1.P.30

), such as address and

DOB

personal details of the child/ren for whom the claim is made, such as name and DOB

details required to establish whether the individual meets the CCS core eligibility requirements

FTB

/regular care child (

2.1.1.13

) (through questions about the percentage of care the individual provides for that child)

Residency requirements (

2.1.2.10

)

Child's age and education level

Immunisation (

2.1.3.20

) status (through the child's Medicare number)

details of recognised participation being undertaken by the individual, and their partner if they have one (

3.5.2

)

estimated

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the individual and their partner, if they have one, (

1.1.I.20

)

TFN

of the individual and their partner, if they have one*

the individuals bank account details*

additional information required for claiming

ACCS

(grandparent) (if applicable) (

2.8.2

).

*

Explanation:

Where an individual or their partner does not have a TFN when making a claim, they may contact Centrelink in person or by phone to submit a staff assisted claim without these details. Centrelink can place the claim 'on hold' for up to 28 days. At this point, the individual has not made an effective CCS claim. If the individual provides the required TFN within the 28-day period (and the claim now meets all other requirements for an effective claim) their claim will be assessed as though it was effective from the day it was initially submitted (not the day that they provided the TFN). Eligibility for CCS can only be backdated up to a maximum of 28 days before an individual made an effective claim.

At the end of 28 days, Centrelink may decide that the TFN is not required for the claim indefinitely. It may be appropriate to make this decision if:

the individual is in a violent or abuse relationship and cannot obtain their partner's TFN

the individual or their partner is unable to obtain a TFN due to location or technology constraints.

If Centrelink doesn't decide to remove the TFN requirement indefinitely, and the individual does not provide Centrelink with the required TFN within 28 days, their claim will lapse, meaning they will need to make a new claim if they wish to receive CCS in future.

7.3.2.30 Waiving a small debt

Summary

This topic provides information about waiving (

1.1.W.10

) the recovery of small debts (

1.1.D.60

) including:

the general provision for debt amounts up to $200

a specific provision where the debt amount is at least $50, and

the cost effectiveness of recovery.

General provision for debt amount less than $200

A debt must be waived if it:

is, or is likely to be, less than $200, and

is not cost effective to recover.

This does not apply where the debt:

is $50 or more, and

can be recovered from

FTB

instalments

social security payments (

1.1.S.80

)

other

FA

entitlements

child care service payments, or

an income tax refund.

Reconciliation

Debt amounts for FTB determined as a result of reconciliation (

6.4.1

), and which are not recovered from FTB top-ups, may be passed onto the

ATO

for recovery from the individual's (

1.1.I.90

) income tax refund, including where the debt amount is less than $50. If the debt amount is only partially recovered from the income tax refund, the remainder of the debt will be passed back to Centrelink.

If the remainder of the debt is less than $50, it may be considered not cost effective to raise and recover and may then subsequently be waived.

Example:

Jane has received FTB by instalment delivery throughout the previous income year but has no ongoing entitlement. Jane has lodged an income tax return and as a result of reconciliation, has a debt of $250. Jane has an available tax refund of $210. The ATO recovers this amount and returns the result to Centrelink. From this point, Centrelink will waive the recovery of the remaining $40 debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 99 Waiver of small debt, section 84 Deductions from debtor's FTB, section 84A Setting off family assistance against debt owed, section 87A Setting off debts of an approved provider against child care service payments

SSAct

Policy reference:

FA Guide

Reconciliation

Cost effectiveness

The following factors should be considered in determining whether it is cost effective to pursue the recovery of a debt:

the amount of the debt

the cost of any further investigation

the cost of recovery in terms of staff resources, calculating and recording the debt and advising the debtor, and

the prospect for recovery.

If the probable cost of recovering the debt is determined to be in excess of the value of the debt, and the amount outstanding is less than $200, the debt must be waived.

2.1.2.40 FTB portability

Summary

This topic provides information about the payability of

FTB

when an individual or their FTB child or regular care child leaves Australia and covers the following:

eligibility & entitlement

overview

Australian residence

absences from Australia

effect of prior absence overseas on FTB

RA during overseas absence

effect of certain temporary visa categories on temporary absences

extensions to the 6 week portability period

child born overseas

individual and FTB child both overseas

when is an absence temporary?

absence is not temporary

temporary absence becomes permanent

individuals employed overseas, and

international social security agreements

.

Eligibility & entitlement

The specific distinction between 'eligibility' (

1.1.E.17

) and 'entitlement' (

1.1.E.30

) in relation to temporary absence from Australia is that:

eligibility refers to the 6-week absence from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) period (after which time an individual is no longer eligible for FTB), and

entitlement refers to the rates payable during a temporary absence.

Overview

FTB Part A and Part B are generally payable overseas for up to 6 weeks (portability). If the individual or FTB child is overseas for more than 6 weeks, FTB will be stopped. If the individual or FTB child return to Australia within 13 weeks of their payment being stopped, their payment can be recommenced without the need for a new claim. They will not be entitled to be paid for any days they are absent in excess of the allowable portability period.

However, if the person or FTB child remains overseas and does not return within 13 weeks of their payments being stopped, then their FTB payments will be cancelled and they will need to reapply on return to Australia.

Note:

CCS

eligibility is linked with FTB eligibility and therefore the same temporary absence from Australia provisions apply. Entitlement to CCS may continue for any temporary absence, for up to 6 weeks, however, the child care must be provided in Australia.

In certain circumstances, the FTB 6 week portability period can be extended for up to 3 years for a temporary absence from Australia. Extensions in certain circumstances also apply to CCS. If the individual was receiving

RA

this may also be paid under this extension.

ES

Part A and Part B can only be paid overseas for up to 6 weeks.

Individuals receiving FTB by instalments must notify Centrelink if they, and/or their child/ren intend to leave Australia, if this might affect their entitlement. They must also notify Centrelink upon their return to Australia. Details of the trip must be obtained by Centrelink to assess ongoing eligibility.

Australian residence

The individual must continue to be an Australian resident during any absence overseas to remain eligible for FTB. To remain an FTB child or regular care child, a child who leaves Australia must continue to:

be an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

), or

live with the individual.

For the individual and/or the FTB child/ren or regular care child/ren to be considered to be Australian residents for FTB purposes, the absence overseas must be temporary, and there must be a clear intention to return to Australia.

For children born overseas refer to '

Child born overseas

' for more details.

Residence requirements

Absences from Australia

FTB may continue to be paid where the FTB child, regular care child and/or the individual are temporarily absent from Australia for up to 6 weeks. In certain circumstances, individuals can apply for an

extension to the 6-week period

for up to 3 years.

The following table explains the effect on FTB eligibility of certain absences of an FTB child, regular care child or individual.

If the …

then …

FTB or regular care child:

is born outside of Australia and is an FTB or regular care child at birth, and

is absent for more than 6 weeks (or extension end date)

the child ceases to be an FTB or regular care child on the day after the 6 week portability period (or extension end date) beginning on the

DOB

.

FTB or regular care child or individual:

leaves Australia, and

is absent for more than 6 weeks (or extension end date)

the child or individual ceases to be eligible for FTB on the day after the 6 week portability period (or extension end date) beginning on the first day of the absence.

FTB or regular care child or individual:

is absent from Australia for less than 6 weeks

returns to Australia, and

leaves after less than 6 weeks

while the child or individual is in Australia FTB is payable, and a new 6-week period commences from the day of the later departure.

FTB child or individual:

was eligible for FTB

ceases to be eligible because of an absence of 6 weeks (or extension end date) or more

returns to Australia, and

leaves after less than 6 weeks

while the child or individual is in Australia FTB is payable

the child or individual is taken not to have returned to Australia and will cease to be eligible from the day of the later departure .

FTB child, regular care child or individual:

is absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks (or extension end date)

returns to Australia, and

leaves after more than 6 weeks

the child or individual is eligible for a new 6 week portability period.

Example:

Amanda is receiving FTB for her 2 children. She travels overseas on a 2 month temporary work placement and her children accompany her. After 6 weeks overseas Amanda's FTB payment stops. Three weeks later Amanda returns to Australia. Centrelink automatically recommences her FTB payments without the need to reclaim. After 5 weeks in Australia, Amanda leaves Australia again to take up a job in Singapore. Amanda's FTB payments stop on departure from Australia as she had not returned to Australia for 6 weeks or more.

Example:

Kym and Ben have an FTB child, Olivia, for whom Kym receives FTB and CCS payments. Kym has to work overseas for more than 6 weeks so her FTB and CCS stop after 6 weeks. Ben and Olivia remain in Australia. If Kym returns to Australia within 13 weeks of her payments being stopped, her FTB and CCS payments can recommence without having to reclaim. However, Kym will not be entitled to be paid FTB or CCS for any days she was absent in excess of the allowable portability period of 6 weeks. Alternatively, because Olivia is still attending child care in Australia, FTB and CCS for Olivia could be paid to Ben for the full duration of Kym's absence if he applies for FTB and CCS and Olivia is in his care in Australia.

Act reference:

Effect of prior absence overseas on FTB

The following table explains the FTB portability rules that apply for a prior overseas absence.

If an individual …

then …

becomes eligible for FTB during a temporary absence

Example:

Following the birth of an eligible FTB child.

the period of the absence prior to eligibility commencing has an effect on eligibility and entitlement.

there is no eligibility for FTB for the individual after 6 weeks, commencing from the day of the departure, even though the child is an FTB child up to 6 weeks from birth.

is eligible for FTB during a temporary absence

ceases to be eligible for FTB because the temporary absence becomes permanent

returns to Australia temporarily, not intending to stay, and

leaves Australia again less than 6 weeks after returning

the individual is not eligible for any FTB while temporarily in Australia (as residence requirements are not satisfied), or upon leaving the country again.

was absent from Australia for more than 6 weeks

was not eligible for FTB while absent from Australia

returns to Australia

becomes eligible for FTB, and

leaves Australia again either before or after 6 weeks of returning

the individual's FTB is portable for up to 6 weeks from the second departure.

Example:

Monique leaves Australia to travel temporarily overseas. She gives birth to her first child 2 weeks after her departure and claims FTB. She can receive FTB Part A and Part B for the first 4 weeks after her child's birth. FTB payments stop for Monique at the end of the 6 weeks (or extension end date) from her date of departure.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 24(4) to (6) Maximum period of eligibility for FTB while individual overseas

RA during overseas absence

If FTB is paid during an individual's temporary absence from Australia for up to 6 weeks, (or for an approved extension), then RA may still be paid with FTB.

RA is only payable for accommodation:

rented in Australia before departure, and

continuing to be rented by the individual while overseas.

If FTB is paid during a child's temporary absence from Australia for up to 6 weeks, (or for an approved extension), then the child is still a RA child in calculating the amount of RA payable.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 Part 5 Division 2B Subdivision A-Rent assistance

Effect of certain temporary visa categories on temporary absences

An individual who has qualified for FTB due to satisfying the

SpB

eligibility criteria because they are the holder of an eligible temporary visa made under SSAct section 729(2)(f)(v) can only be paid FTB for up to 6 weeks of any temporary absence, and only if the absence is for:

an acute family crisis (for example, to visit an immediate family member who is critically ill)

for humanitarian reasons (for example, to adopt a child or attend custody proceedings), or

eligible medical treatment that is not available in Australia.

The individual must provide evidence of the need to travel overseas.

Where an eligible person is to be deployed, they should contact Centrelink prior to departure and request a portability extension due to their overseas deployment. They may need to provide their deployment letter to confirm they are eligible for this extension. The extension for the deployed member is for the length of their deployment, up to a period of 3 years.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 24(7) to (10) Extension of 6-week period in certain circumstances

Child born overseas

An individual can claim FTB for a child who is born overseas while they are outside Australia, subject to other eligibility criteria. The claim must however be lodged within the allowable claim period. The residence requirements for FTB may be satisfied if at least one parent is an Australian resident who is temporarily absent from Australia.

If an individual returns to Australia without the child, they may still be eligible for a payment if the child is still considered to be in their care. They may also be entitled to FTB if the child is an Australian resident or

SCV

holder residing in Australia as long as the child is still in their care. For more detail about FTB residency, see

2.1.2.10

.

Example:

Sarah and Kate are a couple who leave Australia temporarily for 3 weeks. One week after departure, Sarah has a baby and lodges a claim for FTB after the birth. As Sarah and the baby are only temporarily absent from Australia, she may be eligible for FTB from the baby's birth for the remainder of the 6 weeks after Sarah's departure from Australia.

Residence requirements

Individual & FTB child both overseas

Where the individual and the FTB or regular care child are both overseas, the restrictions on portability in respect of the individual and the child as described in the table above need to be considered together. If the individual and child have the same departure date, the 6-week period expires simultaneously. Where the individual and the child have different departure dates, the 6-week period expires at different times.

Example:

Gayle receives FTB for her 2 children, Simone and Jessica. All 3 will be living overseas for a period of 2 years whilst Jessica completes study in Canada. Jessica departs Australia alone on 1 November 2016. Gayle and Simone depart for Canada a month later on 1 December 2016. Gayle's FTB payments for Jessica stop 6 weeks after Jessica's departure. Gayle's FTB payments for Simone stop 6 weeks after they depart Australia.

If the child leaves Australia temporarily for up to 6 weeks or less, CCS may continue to be payable until the child returns noting that CCS is only payable for child care provided in Australia.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 24 Effect of certain absences of FTB child etc. from Australia

When is an absence temporary?

The individual must intend that they or their FTB child or regular care child will return to Australia for the absence to be regarded as temporary. Whether an absence will be temporary may be apparent from the purpose of the overseas absence. The reason for the absence should be consistent with the intended duration.

The following factors should also be considered:

commitment to any overseas home, and

evidence of continuing ties with Australia such as

retaining a home, bank account or employment in Australia

whether the person has immediate or extended family still living in Australia, and

the length of residence in Australia before departure.

Example:

Bruno and Pina are Australian citizens. Pina is receiving FTB for their children. Bruno has a good job, and they own their own home in Australia, as well as 2 units that they rent out. The family has visited Italy once for a short holiday to visit relatives since they migrated to Australia. Pina's parent in Italy becomes terminally ill, so the family decides to return to Italy to spend time with Pina's parent. Bruno takes leave from his job, but he returns to Australia after 4 weeks. Pina and the children remain in Italy, living with relatives. Pina states that the absence is temporary, as she will return to Australia after her parent's funeral. Pina and the children continue to be Australian residents. Their family home is in Australia, and Bruno has already returned to Australia. Their investment properties are in Australia. If Pina is overseas she will be eligible for FTB for up to 6 weeks or for a longer period if she meets the requirements for an extension.

Absence is not temporary

FTB payments cease if an individual or FTB child leaves Australia permanently, as they are no longer considered Australian residents for FTB purposes.

If the absence is permanent, eligibility does not continue. If the individual is going overseas permanently, FTB is cancelled from the date of departure. If the FTB or regular care child is going overseas permanently, they cease to be an FTB or regular care child from the date of departure and the individual's FTB must be reassessed.

Example:

Joan receives FTB for her 3 children. Joan and her partner Lloyd own their home in Australia. They originally migrated from England, and their extended family live in England and Scotland. Lloyd is offered a one year contract of employment in England. Joan notifies Centrelink that she and the children will accompany Lloyd to England. Joan and Lloyd sell their house and furniture before they leave for England. They do not purchase return tickets for their trip. Even though the term of Lloyd's employment is only one year, they cease to be Australian residents. They have ended their financial ties with Australia and have no personal ties. The fact that they are returning to their original homeland with personal, employment and financial ties there indicates that they do not intend to reside permanently in Australia.

Temporary absence becomes permanent

If the absence is initially regarded as temporary, but the individual advises that the absence has become permanent, FTB must be reassessed from the date the individual becomes aware that the absence is permanent.

Example:

Sally is a sole parent who receives FTB for her child. She travels overseas for a one month holiday in the USA, and her FTB continues as the absence is temporary. However, while she is overseas she meets someone and decides to get married and live in the USA. She notifies Centrelink once she makes the decision not to return to Australia. Her eligibility to FTB ceases from the date that she makes her decision.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.2.10

Residence requirements

Individuals employed overseas

The same provisions apply to all individuals, including those who are:

missionaries

foreign aid projects personnel

members of the defence forces who are posted overseas, and

Australian Government employees who are posted overseas.

If a person travels to Australia to train as a missionary before being posted overseas, payment of FTB during their posting can only be granted if:

the residence requirements have been met, and

Centrelink is satisfied that the person intends to return to Australia rather than their country of origin.

This may be determined by:

the nature of property and assets held in Australia and/or the country of origin, and

establishing to which country the person has the greater commitment.

While members of the defence forces and Australian Federal Police are generally subject to these provisions, some members may be able eligible for an extension to the 6 week portability period.

International social security agreements

FTB is not included under international social security agreements. Instead, from 1 July 2000, 'additional child amount' is in the portability (

1.1.P.90

) rate calculator of the SSAct.

The additional child amount is a fixed amount based on the family allowance and guardian allowance rates applicable at 30 June 2000. The payment is indexed in January each year according to the family allowance indexation rules. These indexation rules continue to apply after 1 July 2000 and only apply to this payment.

3.2.4 Target foreign income

Summary

This topic explains the assessment of target foreign income (

1.1.T.05

) for the

FTB

,

CCS

,

ACCS

and

SBP

income tests and covers the following:

definition of target foreign income

individuals (

1.1.I.90

) with target foreign income

assessing target foreign income, and

access to 'blocked' target foreign income.

Definition of target foreign income

Target foreign income is a component of

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

). Target foreign income for FTB, CCS, ACCS and SBP purposes is the amount of an individual's foreign income that is neither taxable income, nor received in the form of a reportable fringe benefit. It also includes income exempted from income tax under

Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

section 23AF and section 23AG.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 5(1) Target foreign income

SSAct

section 10A(2)-'foreign income'

Individuals with target foreign income

There are many situations where individuals may have target foreign income.

Examples:

Individuals who have target foreign income may include:

residents employed outside Australia (

1.1.A.120

) whose foreign employment income is not taxable in Australia, including those employees of international organisations such as the United Nations, and employees of approved overseas projects

residents who receive gifts or allowances of money from any foreign source on a regular basis, including those receiving regular money or gifts from relatives living overseas, which are exempt from Australian tax

residents who receive income from foreign business interests or investments which are exempt from Australian tax, including migrants with business interests in their country of origin

newly arrived migrants who expect to receive foreign income in the current year that is not subject to tax in Australia

non-residents, partnered to Australian residents (

1.1.A.130

), working in Australia for overseas companies, organisations or governments, including civil servants and defence personnel posted to Australia, non-residents working temporarily at Australian education institutions or visiting students, and

residents who receive an overseas pension or benefit that is not taxable income under the Income Tax Assessment Act.

Assessing target foreign income

When new FTB, CCS or ACCS claims or reassessments are made, individuals are asked to state the amount of target foreign income they expect to receive in the current tax year. For the purposes of the SBP income test, individuals need to state the amount for the relevant 6-month income test period (for further details on how the income test period is defined for SBP see

4.15.1)

. The income must relate to the Australian tax year even if this is different from the source country's tax year.

Individuals with income from foreign business interests can deduct allowable business expenses from that income amount. Discretion is needed when deciding to verify an individual's declared target foreign income. If an individual is unsure whether their foreign income is taxable in Australia, the

ATO

can clarify their taxation status.

Foreign income, after it is converted to Australian dollars, is a component of ATI. Centrelink will convert the income using appropriate exchange rates available at the

CBA

on 1 July for the tax year in which the income is received. If the exchange rate from 1 July for a particular currency is not available, the exchange rate to be used is the rate available on the last working day before 1 July.

Note:

Tax exempt foreign income does not need to be converted as the source of that income is Australia.

Access to 'blocked' foreign income

If foreign income cannot be accessed in Australia, it is not assessable income for FTB, CCS, ACCS or SBP purposes. This may occur when access is so limited that the income is not 'earned, derived or received for the person's own use or benefit'.

Explanation:

Some countries have strict exchange control regulations that prevent an individual gaining access to income in that country, usually unless the individual is actually in that country. There may also be restrictions on how this money can be withdrawn or spent.

FTB and CCS or ACCS would need to be reassessed if the individual visited the country in which they have blocked income, and they gain access to the money.

SBP is not subject to reassessment, as the estimate is based on the 'best efforts' of the individual at the time the claim is made.

3.1.5.80 Payer is overseas

Payer is overseas

Australia (

1.1.A.120

) has reciprocal child support (

1.1.C.20

) arrangements with a number of countries. These arrangements allow for the mutual recognition and enforcement of maintenance (

1.1.M.10

).

For more information and a list of countries with which Australia has reciprocal arrangements refer to CS Guide

1.5

.

Where a payer is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, an individual can usually apply for a child support assessment. However, in some cases an individual will obtain a maintenance decision from the payer's jurisdiction. This topic addresses the latter scenario.

Child Support collection of maintenance in accordance with registered overseas maintenance liabilities

If a payer is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction for child support purposes, an individual may choose to take action in a reciprocating jurisdiction to obtain maintenance under the laws of that jurisdiction. The individual may choose to have an overseas maintenance liability collected by Child Support. Under this arrangement, the individual is considered to have taken reasonable maintenance action if it was reasonable in the circumstances to obtain an overseas maintenance liability, instead of a child support assessment. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances in the particular case, but factors that may be relevant to consider in the circumstances of the case may include whether:

the individual obtained the overseas maintenance liability before their arrival in Australia

the overseas maintenance liability is already registered with Child Support for collection

the amount of maintenance under the overseas maintenance liability is comparable to what the individual would likely be entitled to under an administrative assessment

it is easier for the individual to obtain an overseas maintenance liability from the reciprocating jurisdiction, rather than requesting that jurisdiction to recognise and enforce an administrative assessment.

The above factors do not represent an exhaustive list and not all of the above factors will be relevant to every case.

Example:

Mary, an

FTB

recipient, lives in Australia with their 2 children. Jacob, the father of their 2 children, is living in Germany, a reciprocating jurisdiction. A court order made in Berlin before Mary applied for FTB sets out the provisions for child maintenance and this order is already registered for collection with Child Support. The order is being enforced by the German authorities and maintenance payments transmitted to Child Support and disbursed to Mary. Mary has taken reasonable action to obtain maintenance for her children and Child Support advises Centrelink of the amounts collected.

Private collection in accordance with an overseas maintenance liability

If a payer is a resident overseas, whether or not in a reciprocating jurisdiction, an individual may take action to obtain maintenance under the laws of that jurisdiction and privately collect maintenance from the other parent. Under this arrangement the individual is considered to have taken reasonable maintenance action if it was reasonable in the circumstances to obtain maintenance overseas, instead of a child support assessment. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances in the particular case, but factors that may be relevant to consider in the circumstances of the case may include whether:

the individual started receiving the maintenance before their arrival in Australia

the amount of maintenance received from overseas is comparable to what the individual would likely be entitled to under an administrative assessment

it is easier for the individual to privately collect maintenance under an overseas liability, than it is to privately collect maintenance from the overseas based payer under an administrative assessment

the individual cannot apply for an assessment because the payer is not in a reciprocating jurisdiction, but is able to obtain maintenance privately from the payer.

The above factors do not represent an exhaustive list and not all of the above factors will be relevant to every case.

Note:

In choosing not to involve Child Support, the individual is required to advise Centrelink of the maintenance received privately under the overseas maintenance liability.

Example:

Annabelle, an FTB recipient, lives in Australia with their 2 children. George, the father of their 2 children, is living in Germany, a reciprocating jurisdiction. A court order made in Berlin before Annabelle applied for FTB sets out the provisions for child maintenance. Annabelle has not applied for a child support assessment, as she would not be entitled to a higher rate of maintenance than what she receives under the German order. Annabelle is also collecting the amounts under the German order privately. Annabelle has taken reasonable action to obtain maintenance for her children and she advises Centrelink of the amounts she is collecting under the order.

Stillborn baby payment (SBP) - description

FTB child living away from home

FTB can be paid for a child who is living away from home as long as the adult continues to have responsibility for the care of the child. This situation usually occurs with children living away from home to attend school. Although the adult may not have day-to-day contact with the child, the adult may still be providing care for the child (

2.1.1.85

).

The adult may be required to provide evidence supporting claims they have responsibility for the care of the child. Evidence of care may include:

providing for the child financially

continuing responsibility for the long-term welfare of the child, and

the child usually returns home for school holidays.

Example:

Emma receives FTB for their child Julian who is studying towards their senior secondary school qualification at a boarding school. Emma pays all the school fees and is informed by the school anytime Julian is sick. Julian returns home for school holidays.

In some circumstances a young person who is living away from home to study may be eligible for

YA

(see SS Guide

).

Act reference:

section 22(2) Individual aged under 16

FTB child is a member of a couple

It is possible for an individual who is a member of a couple to be an FTB child of another adult. However, the circumstances under which this can occur are limited.

Example 1:

Kate's 17 year old child Emma and Emma's partner Kym are living with Kate. Kym has a part-time job. Emma is 7 months pregnant and has been unable to continue with their study due to difficulties with the pregnancy. Kate has been providing daily care for Emma, who is exempt from the FTB activity test. Emma has not claimed a payment in their own right. Kate can claim FTB for Emma.

Example 2:

Laurel is receiving FTB for their 18 year old secondary student child Cindy. Cindy moves in with their 20 year old boyfriend Sean who receives YA. Cindy is not qualified for YA as an independent young person until Cindy and Sean have lived together for 12 months. Laurel pays Cindy's share of the rent and Cindy returns home in semester breaks. Laurel can continue to receive FTB for Cindy while Cindy continues to be a senior secondary school child.

1.1.H.20 Hourly rate caps (CCS)

Definition

The hourly rate caps place an upper limit on the amount of

CCS

the Australian Government will provide for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) delivered by each type of approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

). The CCS hourly rate caps are used in combination with a family's CCS applicable percentage (

1.1.A.70

) to calculate the amount of subsidy per hour a family is entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to receive for all the hours in a session of care. CCS is calculated as a percentage of the actual fee charged, or of the relevant hourly rate cap (whichever is lower).

The hourly rate caps are increased by the

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year.

For more information on how hourly rate caps are applied, see

3.1.4.50 Health care card (HCC)

Summary

This topic provides information on when an individual is issued a

HCC

and covers the following:

automatic issue of HCC

individuals with regular care children

individuals with shared care of

FTB

children, and

where HCC entitlement is not automatic, due to the individual's income estimate.

Automatic issue of HCC

Individuals who are eligible to receive FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil, and whose income is below the FTB Part A income free area (

3.1.1.20

), automatically qualify for a HCC. Qualification for the HCC is not affected by maintenance income or failure of the

MAT

.

This HCC qualification is only available to individuals who receive FTB by fortnightly instalments. The HCC is issued for a 12-month period and renewed automatically based on the individual meeting the eligibility criteria.

Individuals who receive FTB are issued with a HCC on the first day that their income estimate is below the FTB Part A income free area. If the individual's income increases to an amount above the FTB Part A income free area, they are no longer eligible for the HCC. These individuals are able to test their eligibility for a low income HCC (LIC) (SS Guide

3.9.1.20

).

Note:

Where reconciliation shows that an individual who received FTB instalment payments would have been eligible for the FTB HCC (but their income estimate exceeded the FTB Part A income free area) it may be possible to obtain the HCC retrospectively. However, this would only be of benefit where the person has retained all evidence and receipts of pharmaceutical expenditure for the elapsed period. Some reimbursement of these costs may be possible through Medicare.

From 1 January 2019, a 52-week

NARWP

applies to FTB Part A. An individual who is serving a NARWP for FTB Part A can remain eligible for FTB, but receives a nil rate for FTB Part A. This means the individual is not eligible for HCC while they are serving the NARWP for FTB Part A. There are a range of exemptions from the NARWP for various payments and concession cards, and situations where the NARWP does not apply (

2.2.1.10

). From 1 January 2019, individuals who have an FTB child are exempt from the NARWP for a LIC. A person does not have to be receiving FTB to qualify for this exemption.

Individuals with regular care children

Individuals who have regular care of their child/ren may also qualify for the HCC if their income estimate does not exceed the FTB Part A income free area. Qualification still arises even if they are not entitled to be paid FTB Part A via instalment.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.1.R.21

Regular care child

Individuals with shared care of FTB children

If an individual is receiving a part rate of FTB Part A due to having shared care of their FTB child/ren, they may still qualify for an automatic HCC if their

ATI

is below the FTB Part A income free area.

If both parents/carers of an FTB child are eligible to receive a HCC, the FTB child will appear on each individual's card.

Where HCC entitlement is not automatic, due to the individual's income estimate

Where an individual is not entitled to the FTB HCC because their income estimate exceeds the FTB Part A income free area, they may choose to test their eligibility for a LIC. Eligibility for the LIC is determined using an individual's actual income over the 8-week period immediately before they claimed the card. (The additional child add-on amount for the LIC can result in the individual’s qualifying income limit being above the FTB Part A income free area. Similarly, an individual’s FTB income estimate may exceed the FTB Part A income free area, but their actual income over the 8-week LIC period may be below their qualifying income limit.)

6.4.3 Requirement to lodge an income tax return

Introduction

This section discusses the requirement for individuals who receive

FTB

(and/or their partners) to lodge an income tax return, or to notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return. It also outlines the processes that Centrelink may undertake if the individuals (and/or their partners) fail to lodge an income tax return.

There is no explicit requirement under

FA

law for individuals to lodge a tax return. The Commissioner of Taxation has the authority to determine if an individual is required to do so. This requirement is imposed under tax law for certain individuals who are covered by 2 annual legislative instruments created by the Commissioner of Taxation each financial year. These instruments are:

Notice of Requirement to Lodge a Return for the Income Year Ended 30 June (relevant year), and

Notice of Requirement for Parents with a Child Support Assessment to Lodge a Return for the Income Year Ended 30 June (relevant year).

Act reference:

Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

section 161 Annual returns

Lodge an income tax return within 12 months of entitlement

An individual claiming FTB (and/or their partner), is required to lodge an income tax return or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months following the income year (

1.1.I.75

) in which they received a payment.

Where an individual (and/or their partner) lodges an income tax return or notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, the individual's payments for the income year are reconciled.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.1

Overview of reconciliation

Advise of ATI within 12 months of entitlement if not required to lodge an income tax return

An individual who receives FTB (and/or their partner) is required to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months from the end of the relevant income year.

Where an individual (and/or their partner) notifies Centrelink of their ATI because they are not required to lodge an income tax return, Centrelink must determine that the ATI amount declared for the relevant income year is reasonable in order for their payments to be reconciled.

Non-lodger debt is raised if income tax return is not lodged or Centrelink is not notified of ATI if not required to lodge

If an individual (and/or their partner) fails to lodge an income tax return or fails to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

), a non-lodger debt will be raised. The debt will comprise any FTB they received in the relevant income year.

In addition, where a non-lodger debt is raised that includes a day that

SBP

was paid (under the FTB Part A eligibility test), the SBP amount paid will also be raised as a debt.

Note:

Other FA payments, such as SBP (where paid under the income test), are not raised as a debt as they have no tax lodgement requirements.

Note:

Where

NBS

and/or

NBU

are included in a non-lodger debt or an SBP debt is raised due to an FTB non-lodger decision, the individual's entitlement to NBS, NBU and/or SBP for that child is not reassessed until the non-lodger status is resolved.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28AA Effect of section 28 on NBU of FTB

Non-lodger process

A non-lodger decision may be made at any time following the end of the lodgement year. Following a decision, a variation of entitlement is issued to the individual by Centrelink. A grace period is provided for a period of 75 days beginning on the day of the variation of an individual's FTB entitlement for a relevant income year in order for the individual to resolve their non-lodger status. The grace period may be a longer period if the Secretary determines that there are special circumstances to vary the length of the grace period. FTB payments based on income estimates may continue to be paid during the grace period but would cease if there are still outstanding income tax returns, or Centrelink has not been notified of the individual’s (and/or their partner’s) ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, and there are still outstanding non-lodger debts by the end of this period.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.3.40

Prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Lodgement of tax return after the lodgement period - instalment recipients

If an individual who receives FTB by instalment (and/or their partner), fails to lodge an income tax return or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months following the relevant income year, then they are no longer eligible to receive any top-up payments including the FTB Part A and FTB Part B supplements.

Where an individual (and/or their partner) lodges an income tax return after the lodgement year, they will only be entitled to the lesser of:

the amount of FA the individual was entitled to during the relevant income year, or

the amount of FA the individual was entitled to based on actual ATI.

Explanation:

This means that the individual will not be entitled to receive any top-up payment or FTB supplements if they lodge income tax return/s after the lodgement year.

An individual who has chosen to defer some of their FTB entitlement for the relevant year and lodges a tax return, or notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, after the end of the lodgement year, they can only be paid the lesser of their legislative entitlement based on ATI or the amount they would have received for the relevant income year based on their estimated income had the choice not been made to defer some or all of their FTB for that income year.

The 12-month lodgement timeframe may be extended if special circumstances exist that prevent the individual from meeting their income confirmation obligations. An extension can be granted up to the end of the year following the lodgement year.

Lodgement of tax returns after the lodgement period - lump sum claimants

An individual (and/or their partner), is required to lodge an income tax return or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months following the entitlement year (this is the same requirement that applies to instalment recipients). If this timeframe is not met, the claim is considered not effective. For further information about determining FTB past period claims, see

4.2.3.10

.

The 12-month lodgement timeframe may be extended if special circumstances exist that prevent the individual from meeting their income confirmation obligations. An extension can be granted up to the end of the income year following the lodgement year.

Note:

Lodgements of tax returns are the responsibility of the individual, including those who lodge via a tax agent. Providing financial statements to a tax agent or accountant prior to 30 June of the relevant lodgement year does not constitute lodgement of tax returns for FTB purposes. Centrelink may grant an extension to the lodgement period if there are special circumstances that prevent an individual from meeting their income confirmation obligations before the end of the lodgement year. A tax lodgement deferral granted by the

ATO

does not automatically guarantee that Centrelink will grant a special circumstances extension. Special circumstances are circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Failure by an accountant or tax agent to lodge a tax return within the lodgement period (for example, forgetting to lodge in time or delay due to high workloads) will not ordinarily constitute special circumstances.

Explanation:

The ATO may grant a tax lodgement deferral after considering the individual’s circumstances in the context of tax law. However, this does not obligate Centrelink to grant an extension to the FA lodgement period as the objects of and considerations relevant to FA law differ from those applicable to tax law.

1.1.C.05 Care arrangement (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, a care arrangement in relation to a child means:

a written agreement (see details below) between the parents of the child, or between a parent of the child and another person that relates to the care of the child

a parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

) for the child, or

any of the following orders relating to the child

a family violence order

a parenting order

a registered state child order

a registered overseas child order.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'family law order'

Family Law Act 1975

section 4(1)- 'family violence order', section 64B Meaning of parenting order and related terms, section 70D Registration of orders in a particular State, section 70G Registration of orders

Written agreement for care of a child

A care arrangement (written agreement) exists between separated parents (or a parent and another person who cares for the child) if:

there is a document in writing

the document is signed and dated by both parties

both parties agree on the care arrangements for the child which are specified in the document. For example, the document includes a statement to the effect 'we agree to 50/50 split for care of Billy' with the signature of both parents immediately below. Mere acknowledgment that care is occurring in a particular way does not constitute a written agreement.

Example:

Joe and Mary have separated and have decided to share the care of their child, Billy, on a 50/50 basis. Joe records this arrangement on his shift roster by writing that Joe and Mary 'agree to provide care for Billy on a 50/50 shared care basis', with the different time each party is to have care of Billy indicated on the shift roster. Joe and Mary both sign and date the document. As both parties have clearly indicated that they agree to the arrangements for the ongoing care of Billy, this constitutes a written agreement. As such, a care arrangement between Joe and Mary for the care of Billy exists and is relevant in the event of any dispute in relation to the exercise of care for Billy.

Example:

Matt and Glenda have recently separated and Glenda applies for FTB for their daughter, Chloe. As part of the claim process, Glenda indicates her level of care for Chloe is 60% and Matt's as 40%. Centrelink asks Matt whether the level of care indicated by Glenda is accurate and Matt states that it is and acknowledges this in writing. However, even though both Matt and Glenda have indicated in a signed document that they acknowledge the level of care that is currently occurring for Chloe, there is nothing on the document to indicate that Matt and Glenda agree that this constitutes an ongoing arrangement for the care of Chloe. Upon further questioning of Matt it is established that as their living arrangements are not yet settled Matt and Glenda have decided to wait at least 6 months before entering a formal arrangement for the ongoing care of Chloe. In this case, although Glenda and Matt have acknowledged existing levels of care for Chloe, it is not considered to be a written agreement. Therefore, for the purposes of FTB, there is no care arrangement between Matt and Glenda for the care of Chloe.

Example:

Rhys and Beth have separated and have agreed to share care of their son William. Beth was already receiving FTB Part A for William prior to her separation from Rhys. Instead of having a formal parenting order in place Beth has provided a form (for example, FA012), co-signed by Rhys, in relation to her claims for FTB. As the document has been signed and dated by both parties this is accepted as a written agreement of care for William.

2.1.1.20 Shared care & change of care summary

Summary

Where more than one adult has care of an

FTB

child in a pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

), for at least 35% of the time (that is at least 128 nights a year), payment of FTB can be shared. As distinct from shared care, a change of care occurs when the full caring responsibility for an FTB child passes to another person.

Approved care organisations (

1.1.A.80

)

Generally, if a child enters or leaves the care of an

ACO

, a change of care has occurred. An ACO cannot share FTB for a child.

Explanation:

A determination to share the care of an FTB child under FAAct section 59 only applies to individuals (

1.1.I.90

). If the care of a child is shared between an individual and an ACO, the individual may be able to receive all of the FTB, as ACOs cannot share FTB for a child.

If a child leaves the care of an ACO for a short-term absence, and no one else is eligible for FTB for the child, the ACO continues to be eligible for FTB.

Example:

Patrick lives in an ACO. The ACO has sole legal responsibility (

1.1.L.20

) for his daily care. Twice a year Patrick spends a week with his grandparents. His grandparents are not eligible for FTB as a change of care does not occur. The ACO continues to receive FTB for Patrick during his absences.

Foster carers

If a child is placed in foster care this could be under a change of care or a shared care arrangement. Where the care of the child is being shared between a foster carer and another person (usually the parent), the normal shared care rules can be applied.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.85

Formal & informal care of an FTB child

Shared care

A care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

) for shared care may be specified in a:

written agreement

family law order (

1.1.F.10

)

parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

) or parenting order (

1.1.P.19

), or

custody order (

1.1.C.70

).

Explanation:

Generally 2 or more adults who have decided to share the care of a child will have a semi-formal or formal arrangement where they have decided on how much time the child will spend with each person. Care of the child is shared in a pattern of care, with the expectation that the arrangement is ongoing.

Note:

From 1 July 2010, an assessment of shared care that is determined by either Centrelink for

FA

purposes or Child Support for child support purposes will have effect for the other agency in relation to care periods that begin on or after this date. This means that where a care percentage has been determined by Child Support that determination will be aligned for the purpose of FA and will be applied in determining the individual's care percentage for FA purposes (

2.1.1.30

).

FTB can be shared by:

2 or more people who are not members of a couple (

1.1.M.50

)

a separated couple who still live in the same dwelling, or

a separated couple who have claimed FTB for a past period that occurred before separation.

An adult must care for an FTB child for at least 35% of the care period to be eligible for FTB. Unless the parents advise their agreed care percentages or an agreed care arrangement, a pattern of care must be established to work out how much time in the period the child spends with each person. This is used to calculate the percentage of care and the rate of FTB for each person. Entitlement to FTB is continuous for each person, regardless of the physical location of the child at a given point in time.

Example:

Sue cares for her son Sam throughout the year. Sam's parent Bob, cares for Sam every school holiday and one weekend a month, which is calculated to be 35% of the care period. Therefore the proportion of FTB is:

65% for Sue, and

35% for Bob.

The FTB shared care percentage is assessed on the basis of the care arrangement between the parent/carers, or the pattern of care for the child where this differs from the care arrangement and an interim period does not apply (

2.1.1.70

). If there is no care arrangement in place Centrelink must decide the percentage which reflects the actual care arrangements based on the available evidence, as outlined in

2.1.1.30

.

An FTB shared care percentage will be used to work out a parent's FTB Part A rate. The FTB shared care percentage will be worked out in the following way:

No. of nights care (annually)

Percentage of Care

FTB shared care percentage

0 to 51

0% to less than 14%

Not eligible for FTB.

52 to 127

14% to less than 35%

Not eligible for child related components of FTB. Eligible for

RA

component and other government benefits.

128 to 175

35% to less than 48%

25% plus 2% for each percentage point over 35%.

Example:

You have care of your child for 40% of the time, so your FTB shared care percentage is 35%.

176 to 189

48% to 52%

50%

190 to 237

More than 52% to 65%

51% plus 2% for each percentage point over 53%.

Example:

You have care of your child for 60% of the time, so your FTB shared care percentage is 65%.

238 to 365

More than 65% to 100%

100%

Change of care

A change of care occurs if the FTB child leaves the daily care of an individual or ACO, either for a temporary period or permanently. The person who gains the daily care of the child may or may not claim FTB.

Explanation:

Short-term absences do not affect FTB eligibility for the individual or ACO. A short-term absence is generally less than 4 weeks.

Examples:

Sally goes on an interstate holiday with her grandparents for 2 weeks, and then returns home to her parent. Sally's parent does not lose eligibility for FTB for Sally.

Robert is an orphan and is cared for by Sleepy Hollow, an ACO. Robert stays with his Uncle Trevor each school holiday period. Sleepy Hollow does not lose eligibility for FTB for Robert when he stays with his Uncle Trevor.

Effect of different payment delivery options

Depending on the payment delivery option chosen by each individual, it may be difficult to decide whether the care of a child is shared, or if a change of care has occurred.

For individuals receiving FTB by instalment payments (as well as for those receiving FTB by lump sum payments), the care arrangements must be determined before payment of FTB for a shared care child can be made. Where one individual has chosen instalments and another has chosen to claim a lump sum at the end of the tax year after they have lodged their tax return, there can be a discrepancy in the care arrangements declared by each person. This may only be identified after the end of the tax year in which care was provided.

This problem may be reduced for separated individuals who have a child support assessment. Where a person makes a lump sum claim for FTB for a previous year, their percentage of care will be based on the percentage of care that Child Support has assessed and determined for that period. Centrelink can undertake a new care assessment if a change of care has occurred. A person's percentage of care for FTB will be based on the most recent care assessment (

2.1.1.30

). Using information from the care assessment by Child Support helps to avoid discrepancies that may come to light when the second carer makes a lump sum claim and seeks a review of the decision. Any objection about that decision would generally be dealt with by Child Support (

6.2

).

Where there is no assessment of care by Child Support for the period, Centrelink will need to make the assessment of care based on the evidence, where the individuals sharing care of the child still disagree.

Limiting payment for past periods (

1.1.P.60

)

The following table explains how to treat a claim for a past period where another individual's past period or instalment claim for FTB has already been determined for that period by either Centrelink or Child Support. Once a person who has not previously received FTB lodges a claim for a past period, the existing care assessment will apply to determine that person's care percentage for FTB purposes, whether the care assessment is made by Centrelink or Child Support. However, there may have been changes to the care arrangements since the previous care assessment was determined by either Centrelink or Child Support.

If the total percentage of care claimed for a care period …

the percentage of care for the latest past period claim should be accepted based on the claimed figure and a revised care assessment determined after verification with other carer/s where the percentage is less than 100%.

is less than 35%

the claim will be rejected.

Explanation:

The child cannot be an FTB child of an individual if the amount of care provided is less than 35% of the care period.

Example 1:

Julie is a sole parent who receives instalments of FTB for her child and also receives child support from Child Support, who made a previous care determination that Julie has 85% care of her child. During the care period her child visits their other parent, David, for some weekends and the school holidays on a regular basis. Julie does not advise Centrelink or Child Support that her child has left her care for additional periods of time because she does not realise that a change in the care arrangements has occurred. Later, David lodges a past period claim for FTB. Over the 12 month care period, David has cared for his child for 128 days, which is 35% of the year. David is eligible to receive FTB as he has met the minimum 35% care rule for shared care, and satisfies the other claim and eligibility criteria. However, David's claim will need to be verified because Julie has already been paid FTB for the whole financial year. If Centrelink is able to verify that there has been a change in the care arrangements and can establish actual care arrangements throughout the care, Centrelink must revoke the existing determination and make a new care determination that may result in a reassessment of Julie's entitlement and payment of some FTB to David. Julie will have an overpayment as she has received more FTB than she was entitled to receive.

Example 2:

Neil has been receiving fortnightly payments of FTB for Amie based on a care assessment determined by Child Support that he is caring for Amie for 100% of the time. Amie's other parent, Tim, then lodges a lump sum claim with Centrelink at the end of the tax year for 35% care of Amie for the past year. Tim does not agree on their percentage of care, as determined by Child Support. If Centrelink establishes that Child Support determination does not accurately reflect the actual care of Amie, it must revoke the determination and make a new determination based on the evidence, which may create a debt for Neil. If Neil did not agree with the decision of Centrelink, he could seek a review of that decision by Centrelink. However, if Centrelink decided there had been no change in care from the original determination made by Child Support, Tim could lodge an objection with Child Support. Any decision made by Child Support would then apply for FTB purposes.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 35R Secretary may revoke a determination relating to a claim for payment of FTB for a past period

Rejection of past period claims

If the past period claim is rejected, no change is made to the assessed percentage of care for the claims that have previously been determined. However, if a person requests a review of their FTB entitlement, and it is found that no one else is caring for the child for at least 35% of the care period that person's FTB can be reassessed and 100% paid.

Example:

Nellie has claimed instalments of FTB based on caring for her child for 65% of the care period. Brian makes a past period claim for FTB based on 31% care and his claim is subsequently rejected as he did not have care for at least 35% of the time. As Nellie had more than 65% care of her child, she is entitled to receive 100% of FTB.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 25 Effect of an individual's percentage of care for a child being less than 35%

2.6.5 CCS - requirements relating to CWA

Introduction

The establishment and maintenance of

CWA

(

1.1.C.52

) between approved providers (

1.1.A.90

) and individuals (

1.1.I.90

) is central to determining the individuals' eligibility for

CCS

. While approved providers and individuals may choose to enter into other types of arrangements (

4.13.2

) for the care of a child, CCS can only be paid for care provided under a CWA.

One of the core eligibility requirements (

2.6.1

) for CCS is that the individual, or their partner (

1.1.P.30

), must have incurred a liability to pay for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) under a CWA. The requirement for CWA to be 'in writing' ensures that the basic details about an enrolment (

1.1.E.25

) are recorded and agreed upon, and assist in establishing an individual's liability to pay for child care.

In addition, for the purposes of CCS and

ACCS

, a child starts to be enrolled when an approved provider and an individual (or their partner) enter into a CWA.

Information required in a CWA

A CWA must include the following:

the names and contact details of the provider and the individual/s

the date that the arrangement starts (which is the date the child starts to be enrolled)

the name and

DOB

of the child (or children)

if care will be provided on a routine basis, and if so

details about the days on which sessions of care will usually be provided, and

the usual start and end times for these sessions of care

whether care may be provided on a casual or flexible basis (in addition to, or instead of, a routine basis)

details of fees to be charged under the arrangement (this can be by reference to a fee schedule or information available on the approved provider's website maintained by the provider), that the parties understand may vary from time to time.

These are minimum requirements only - approved providers may include any additional information as appropriate.

A CWA can cover more than one child if multiple children in a family will attend a child care service, although the provider must submit a separate enrolment notice in the

CCSS

for each child.

Format of a CWA

A CWA must be in writing, which includes either hardcopy (paper) or electronic form.

A CWA is a contract between an approved provider and an individual. Approved providers are not required to submit a CWA to the Department of Education or Centrelink unless it is specifically requested under information gathering powers. However, providers are required to submit an enrolment notice in the CCSS for each child that starts to be enrolled under a CWA, including relevant details about the terms of the arrangement, which the individual will be asked to confirm (

2.6.5.10

).

There is also no requirement or expectation that a CWA must be established separately to the enrolment form or other process that an approved provider would normally use to enrol a child (as long as the process meets the requirements for a CWA).

Who should enter into a CWA?

One or both members of a couple may enter into a CWA with the approved provider, but only one member of a couple can make a claim for CCS in respect of a child.

It is possible for one member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) to incur the liability for child care fees by enrolling the child under a CWA, and the other member of the couple to make the claim (

1.1.C.27

) for CCS in respect of the child. In this case, the member of the couple who makes the claim can be eligible for CCS (even though they have not entered into a CWA), as in order to be eligible for CCS, the individual or the individual's partner must have incurred a liability to pay for sessions of care under a CWA.

When submitting the enrolment notice for the child in the CCSS, the approved provider must submit the details of the parent who is the CCS claimant, even where they are not the parent on the CWA, to ensure subsidy can be paid.

Updates to CWA

An approved provider must vary a CWA in writing (including electronically), if the variation has the effect that information in the corresponding enrolment notice becomes incorrect.

Where a detail in an arrangement between an approved provider and an individual changes (whether or not that detail is required in a CWA), resulting in the details in the enrolment notice no longer reflecting the CWA, then both the arrangement between the provider and individual, and the enrolment notice in the CCSS, should be updated.

Importantly, it is intended that updating will only be required where there are ongoing and significant departures from the terms of an original agreement. In particular, where an approved provider and individual agree that certain details (such as routine sessions or usual fees) may vary within an agreed scope, the provider would not need to update the CWA where variations to the care arrangements occur within that agreed scope.

For example, it is anticipated that it may be common for approved providers and individuals to, in addition to agreeing on some routine days and times, also agree that care can be provided on other days and times, depending on the needs of the family and availability of places (which it is understood may fluctuate over time). Use of additional care in this circumstance would not require an update to the CWA under FA(Admin)Act section 200C, or an enrolment update notice under FA(Admin)Act section 200D, as it is within the agreed scope of variation, and does not reflect a significant and ongoing departure from the original arrangement.

In contrast, where an individual, for example, made a permanent change from part-time to fulltime work and changes their child's routine sessions of care accordingly, the provider would need to update the CWA and enrolment notice.

Individuals will be notified (

2.6.5.10

) when an approved provider updates an enrolment notice.

Note:

The ES ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and ACOs may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

If an individual is eligible for FTB for a child and the FTB child dies, the individual is eligible for an FTB bereavement payment. Individuals who receive instalment (

1.1.I.100

) payments may choose to receive the bereavement payment as a lump sum or as a continuation of their eligibility for FTB for that child. Past period (

1.1.P.60

) claimants are paid a lump sum.

If a regular care child dies, the individual who receives

RA

components of FTB for the child may choose to receive the bereavement payment as a lump sum or in instalments.

If the individual is subsequently convicted in relation to the death of the FTB child, the total amount received as bereavement payment may become a recoverable debt to the Commonwealth. The payment should not be stopped on the basis of the charges alone as the individual should be afforded the presumption of innocence.

Bereavement payments & ACOs (

1.1.A.80

)

ACOs are not eligible for a bereavement payment of FTB when an FTB child of the ACO dies. FTB payments to the ACO will cease from the date of the child's death.

Explanation:

The bereavement provisions in the legislation only apply to individuals (

1.1.I.90

).

FTB paid in substitution for a deceased individual

If an individual was eligible for FTB before they died, and there is an amount of FTB outstanding to the individual, the amount can be paid to someone else if the Secretary considers that individual is eligible. This can include a period of eligibility for FTB even if the deceased individual did not claim FTB before they died. It may also include a bereavement payment for a child if the individual's FTB child died at the same time or before the individual died.

Eligibility is worked out based on the circumstances of the deceased individual, not the circumstances of the individual claiming FTB. The amount payable is the amount the individual would have been paid if they had not died. There is no other payment in respect of the individual's death.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 33 Eligibility for FTB if an eligible individual dies

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.2.2

Death of an individual eligible for FTB

Continuation of eligibility for a deceased FTB child

The FTB bereavement payment is a continuation of eligibility for FTB to an individual for a deceased FTB child for a period of 14 weeks from the day the child died. The individual is generally eligible for the same rate of FTB that would have been paid if the child had not died. The rate of FTB payable is still affected by any expected changes in circumstances during the 14-week period.

Example:

Jane lodges a past period claim for FTB for her child Matthew. Matthew died during the period of the claim, 6 weeks before his 5th birthday. Jane's FTB entitlement includes a bereavement payment for Matthew. The bereavement payment consists of 2 rates - a higher rate of FTB Part B for the first 6 weeks and a lower rate taking into account his 5th birthday for the remaining 8 weeks.

If the individual is receiving FTB instalments, their bereavement payment is paid as a continuation of FTB for 14 weeks for the deceased child unless the individual requests a lump sum payment. If the individual is being paid an adjusted rate of FTB (

1.1.A.45

), the rate of FTB during the 14-week continuation period is the adjusted rate, unless the individual requests the original arrangement to cease. Any additional entitlement will be calculated after the end of the financial year, when the individual's actual

ATI

is known.

If the individual is claiming FTB for a past period, the bereavement payment is included in their total lump sum entitlement for the period.

If an individual was entitled to the lower rate of NBS for the child who died, and the child died before their first birthday, the individual is entitled to the higher rate of NBS for that child (subject to the income test), and can be paid a top-up amount of NBS.

Application of the maintenance action & maintenance income tests during the FTB bereavement period

Whether the

MAT

(

3.1.5.10

) and maintenance income test (MIT) are to be applied during the FTB bereavement period depends on several factors including whether the deceased child was:

passing the MAT prior to death, and

the only child in a child support case prior to death.

If the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) from a particular payer and, at the time of the child's death, that individual's FTB Part A was restricted to base rate as a result of failing the MAT, the base rate restriction no longer applies during the bereavement period. Similarly, where an individual was receiving maintenance for the deceased child and the child was the only child for whom they were entitled to receive maintenance from a particular payer, any maintenance received during the bereavement period is disregarded. This is because there is no longer a relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) for maintenance in these circumstances.

In contrast, if the individual is also receiving maintenance from that payer in relation to another child who has not died, the entitlement to maintenance continues for the other FTB child in the child support case and the relevant period for maintenance continues. If the individual was restricted to the base rate for failing the MAT, at the time the child died, the individual would continue to be restricted to base rate during the bereavement period. Any maintenance received during the bereavement period continues to affect the bereavement payment for the deceased child.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.15

Relevant period

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

There are 4 exceptions to the continuation of the rate of FTB during the 14-week bereavement period.

The period of payment cannot include:

if the child had not turned 16, any day on which the child would have been 16 years and the child would not have been a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

)

if the child was aged over 16 years, any day on which the child would have ceased to be a senior secondary school child

if the child was aged 19 years and was a senior secondary school child, 31 December of the calendar year in which the child turned 19, or

if the child was absent from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) and their expected return date was more than 6 weeks in the future, any day which exceeded the initial 6-week absence.

Example:

Sarah has been receiving FTB for her son David, who has been studying full-time toward their year 12 certificate. On 3 December, 2 weeks before the date they were expected to complete their year 12 certificate, David dies in an accident. As it was expected that David would have completed their year 12 certificate on 17 December, Sarah is entitled to receive a bereavement payment for David for the 4-week period until the end of December. As David would have ceased to be a senior secondary school child and consequently ceased to be an FTB child from 1 January of the following year, Sarah's bereavement payments ceases on 1 January.

Note:

A child does not cease to be an FTB child during the 14-week bereavement period in any other circumstances.

Current FTB rates & income test amounts

Lump sum bereavement payment

An individual may request to have their bereavement payment paid as a lump sum instead of as a continuation of entitlement for the deceased child. The lump sum period begins on the day the individual requests the lump sum payment and finishes at the end of the bereavement period, 14 weeks from the day the child died.

Explanation:

The lump sum period does not include the period between the day the child died and the day the individual requests the lump sum payment because the individual's rate of FTB for those days will have already included payment for the deceased child. If the individual was receiving an adjusted rate of FTB, the lump sum payment is calculated based on the adjusted rate, unless the individual requests the original arrangement to cease.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 32(1) Eligibility for a single amount of FTB if an FTB or regular care child dies - Instalment case, section 65(1) Calculation of single amount for death of FTB or regular care child - Instalment case

Quarterly ES & instalment bereavement payments

If an individual is entitled to a bereavement payment by instalment for a child, and has an ES quarterly election in place, the bereavement entitlement would continue to exclude ES. After the end of any affected quarters, the ES review would calculate the extra amount of the ES bereavement payment for days in that quarter (including the days in that quarter that the deceased child is taken to be an FTB child).

If there are no other surviving children, the end of the bereavement period would end the ES quarterly election and an ES review would occur as soon as practical following the end of the bereavement period.

An individual may also elect to end the quarterly election at the commencement of the bereavement period.

Quarterly ES & lump sum bereavement payments

If an individual is entitled to a lump sum bereavement payment for a child, and has an ES quarterly election in place, the quarterly election is ended in order to make the lump sum payment. Individuals may not make a new quarterly election until after the end of the bereavement period.

14-week period extends over 2 financial years

If the entitlement to bereavement payment falls over 2 financial years and the individual chooses to receive their payment as a lump sum paid in the first financial year, the bereavement payment is assessed on the individual's ATI for the first financial year.

Explanation:

This is done by using the ATI for the first financial year to calculate FTB entitlement for the part of the 14-week period falling in the second of the 2 financial years.

If an individual is receiving FTB instalments and receives the bereavement payment as a continuation of their rate during the bereavement, and the 14-week accrual period overlaps 2 financial years, normal rules apply.

Explanation:

Bereavement entitlement for periods during the second financial year is based on ATI for the second year.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 65(1) Calculation of single amount for death of FTB or regular care child - Instalment case

14-week period extends over 2 financial years - past period claim

If an individual makes a past period claim for an FTB child, and the child died during the financial year, they are eligible for the continuation of eligibility for the 14-week period. If the 14-week period spans 2 financial years, the individual is paid a lump sum for the second of the 2 financial years based on their ATI of the first of the 2 financial years. The total amount for the past period claim is paid as one lump sum payment. This includes any entitlements to other FTB components (for example, ES,

MBA

and RA).

Explanation:

A past period claim relates to a single financial year. This provision ensures that entitlement to a lump sum bereavement payment is the same for individuals whether they receive FTB as a lump sum or instalment payments.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 32(2) Eligibility for a single amount of FTB if an FTB or regular care child dies - Other cases, section 65(3) Calculation of single amount for death of FTB or regular care child - Other cases

14-week period extends over 2 financial years - increase in standard rate (

1.1.S.103

)

The standard rate for FTB Part A and FTB Part B increases on 1 July in line with

CPI

changes. Where the 14-week period extends over 2 financial years, the new standard rate from 1 July must be applied for the second part of the period.

Explanation:

This is the rate that would have applied for the child from 1 July if they had not died.

How to calculate a bereavement rate during the 14-week period

Unless an individual requests a lump sum payment, their bereavement payment is paid as a continuation of FTB for 14 weeks for the deceased child.

The individual's rate of FTB is paid for a 14-week period starting from the date of the FTB child's death as though the child did not die. Any changes in rate that would have occurred during this period if the child had not died must still be taken into account:

including changes in the assessment of the individual's estimated or actual ATI, and

disregarding any FTB child from the day they turn 16 if they are not a senior secondary school child, or from 31 December if aged 19 and a senior secondary school child (see

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

above).

However, if the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance, neither the MAT not the MIT would apply during the bereavement period. This is because there is no longer a relevant period for maintenance.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 31 Continued eligibility for FTB if an FTB or regular care child dies, section 64 Calculation of rate of FTB for death of FTB or regular care child

How to calculate a lump sum bereavement payment

The following table shows how to calculate the FTB rate payable to an individual who receives instalment payments.

Step

Action

1

Work out the lump sum period. The lump sum period starts on the day the individual requests the lump sum and ends 14 weeks from the day the child died.

2

Work out the rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B that would have been payable if the child had not died:

including the rate for any other FTB children of the individual

disregarding any FTB child from the day they turn 16 if they are not a senior secondary school child, or from 31 December if aged 19 and a senior secondary school child, or for any overseas absence in excess of the initial 6-week portability period where the expected return date was more than 6 weeks after the departure date (see

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

)

disregarding the base rate restriction as a result of failing the MAT, if the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance from that particular payer

disregarding any maintenance received during the bereavement period, if the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance from that particular payer

applying the ATI from the first financial year only, if the accrual period spans 2 financial years, and

using the standard rate for each FTB child from 1 July to the second part of the period, if the 14-week period spans 2 financial years.

3

Work out the rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B for the lump sum period:

excluding the deceased child

disregarding any FTB child from the day they turn 16 if they are not a senior secondary school child, or from 31 December if aged 19 and a senior secondary school child, or for any overseas absence in excess of the initial 6-week portability period where the expected return date was more than 6 weeks after the departure date (see

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

)

if the accrual period spans 2 financial years, applying the ATI from the first financial year only, and

using the standard rate for each FTB child from 1 July to the second part of the 14-week period, if the accrual period spans 2 financial years.

4

Subtract the result from Step 3 from the result of Step 2 and add any top-up amount of NBS that arises because the deceased child died before their first birthday.

This amount is the lump sum bereavement payment for the deceased child.

How to calculate bereavement payment for a past period claim

If the 14-week period is contained within one financial year, the rate of FTB payable is worked out by continuing the eligibility of the deceased FTB child from the date of death to the end of the 14-week period.

Explanation:

The bereavement payment is included with the total amount payable for the past period claim.

If the 14-week period extends over 2 financial years:

the bereavement amount for the first financial year is included in the past period by the continuation of eligibility for the deceased child, and

a lump sum bereavement amount is worked out for the second of the financial years.

The following table shows how to calculate the lump sum for the second financial year.

Step

Action

1

Work out the lump sum period. The lump sum period begins on 1 July and finishes at the end of the 14-week accrual period.

2

Work out the rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B that would have been payable if the child had not died:

including the rate for any other FTB children of the individual

disregarding any FTB child from the day they turn 16 if they are not a senior secondary school child, or from 31 December if aged 19 and a senior secondary school child, or for any overseas absence in excess of the initial 6-week portability period where the expected return date was more than 6 weeks after the departure date (see

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

)

disregarding the base rate restriction as a result of failing the MAT, if the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance from that particular payer

disregarding any maintenance received during the bereavement period, if the deceased child was the only child for whom the individual was entitled to receive maintenance from that particular payer

applying the ATI from the first financial year of the 14-week period, and

using the standard rate for each FTB child from 1 July to the second part of the period.

3

Work out the rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B for the lump sum period:

excluding the deceased child

disregarding any FTB child from the day they turn 16 if they are not a senior secondary school child, or from 31 December if aged 19 and a senior secondary school child, or for any overseas absence in excess of the initial 6-week portability period where the expected return date was more than 6 weeks after the departure date (see

Exceptions to the continuation of eligibility

)

applying the ATI from the first financial year of the 14-week period, and

using the standard rate for each FTB child from 1 July to the second part of the period.

4

Subtract the result from Step 3 from the result of Step 2 and add any top-up amount of NBS that arises because the deceased child died before their first birthday. This amount is the lump sum bereavement payment for the deceased child.

5

The total amount of the past period claim and the lump sum bereavement payment are paid as one lump sum when the claim is determined.

FTB advances

Bereavement payments for a deceased FTB child, whether paid as instalments over a 14-week period or a lump-sum, may be impacted by the receipt or repayment of an FTB advance.

4.4.5.20 Income tax return not lodged

Income tax return not lodged

If an individual and/or their partner who receives

FTB

are required to lodge an income tax return in respect of an income year (

1.1.I.75

), they should do so by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) (the financial year following the income year). If they fail to do so, a decision can be made to the effect that they are not entitled to FTB for the income year for which the required income tax return has not been lodged. In that instance the amount already received for that year must be raised as a debt and recovered. This debt is known as a non-lodger debt.

Individuals who (and/or whose partner) are not required to lodge an income tax return will also have their FTB entitlement for the relevant income year raised as a debt, if they fail to notify Centrelink of their and/or their partner’s ATI by the end of the lodgement year.

Explanation:

An individual's FTB entitlement for the relevant income year is raised as a debt because failure to lodge an income tax return, or failure to notify Centrelink of their and/or their partner’s ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, has the same effect as not being entitled to the payment. This determination only relates to the relevant income year and does not affect an individual's ongoing entitlement to FTB.

A prohibition of FTB instalment payments may apply if an individual and/or their partner have an outstanding non-lodger debt after a 75 day grace period (

6.4.3.40

).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28 Variation of instalment and past period entitlement determinations where income tax return not lodged, section 32AA Non payment of FTB for non-lodgement of tax returns

Tax return subsequently lodged in the second lodgement year

Where the outstanding income tax return is subsequently lodged in the second income year following the entitlement year, the non-lodger determination must be varied further, effectively extinguishing the non-lodger debt for the entitlement year. However, the individual's entitlement for that year will be recalculated taking into account the newly available assessment of taxable income.

The further variation may result in a debt, nil adjustment, or, if Centrelink has granted an extension on the tax lodgement timeframe due to special circumstances, a top-up (including supplements).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28 Variation of instalment and past period entitlement determinations where income tax return not lodged

Tax return subsequently lodged after the second lodgement year

Where the outstanding income tax return is lodged after the second income year following the year of entitlement, the non-lodger determination must be varied, taking into account the newly available assessment of taxable income. However, the variation may only result in a debt or nil adjustment. No top-ups (including supplements) are payable in this instance.

6.4.5.30 Death of FTB or regular care child

Summary

This topic explains the reconciliation process when an

FTB

or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) dies.

Debt to be waived where only FTB child/ren dies

If the only FTB child/ren of an individual (

1.1.I.90

) dies either during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

), or in the first lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) before reconciliation has occurred, any FTB,

CCS

or

ACCS

debt (

1.1.D.60

) arising from the reconciliation process in respect of the period (including the bereavement period) for which the individual was eligible for FTB, CCS or ACCS may be waived (

1.1.W.10

).

If an FTB or regular care child dies, the death may be considered special circumstances on a case by case basis. If the death is considered to be special circumstances, a debt may be waived under the FA(Admin)Act section 101. The debt may be waived under special circumstances only if the individual has not made a false statement or representation, or has not failed or omitted to comply with a provision of the family assistance law. In general, providing an income estimate for a financial year that is less than the actual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for that year should not be treated as such a breach.

Example:

When Noni's FTB for the last financial year was reconciled in September, an FTB debt resulted because they had underestimated their ATI for that income year. As Noni's only FTB child died in August of the current financial year, (that is, in the first lodgement year), recovery of their debts may be waived under special circumstances due to the death of their child in the income year. If reconciliation of Noni's FTB for the current financial year also resulted in a debt being raised, recovery of this debt also would be waived under special circumstances (due to the death of their child in the income year).

Summary

This topic provides information about using the use of

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) entitlements to recover a debt (

1.1.D.60

).

Available

FTB

top-ups (including supplements or lump sum payments) can be used to offset any outstanding FA, social security, and/or other applicable debts due to the Commonwealth. When using this type of offsetting, it is open for the decision maker to apply only part of an amount of FA against a debt to offset it partially, or in full. Such a decision will be guided by the circumstances of the case.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 84A Setting off family assistance against debt owed

Top-up payments

A top-up is the balance of an entitlement due to an individual (

1.1.I.90)

, generally individuals who receive FTB by fortnightly instalments. Top-up payments include any supplements to which an individual is eligible.

Available FTB top-ups can be used to offset any outstanding FA, social security, and/or other applicable debts due to the Commonwealth.

Note:

CCS

or

ACCS

top-ups can only be used to offset other CCS or ACCS debts. Any possible top-up will be determined after reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

) has occurred for the individual.

FTB lump sum payments

Lump sums are the total FTB entitlement, including supplements, due to an individual who chooses to receive FTB in annual payments.

For debt recovery purposes, FTB and/or

SIFS

lump sum entitlements are treated similarly to top-up payments. Individuals who receive FTB by lump sums will receive the balance of entitlements, if any, after all FA, social security, and/or other applicable debts due to the Commonwealth have been recovered.

Debt recovery - general provisions

FTB arrears payments

An FTB arrears payment is a lump sum amount that arises when a reassessment of an individual's entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) occurs with retrospective effect. This can occur when an individual provides some additional information or does something that gives rise to additional entitlement (for example, resolving their non-lodger status and having a prohibition on instalment payments lifted). These arrears amounts can be used to offset any outstanding FA, social security, and/or other applicable debts due to the Commonwealth.

Refunding offset amounts

Centrelink may review a decision to offset an individual's FA, social security and/or other applicable debts due to the Commonwealth against their FA entitlement where Centrelink is satisfied there is sufficient reason to do so. Centrelink may choose to refund the whole or a part of the offset amount as a result of the review.

Example:

Frankie’s FTB top-up is used to offset their existing FA debt. However, Frankie’s father, who is residing in another state, becomes critically ill and Frankie is required to travel to assist them. Frankie is managing their regular expenses, but cannot afford the additional expenses associated with travelling to and assisting their father. Centrelink reviews the decision and determines that the offset amount can be refunded.

Example

: Tillie’s favourite sporting team is competing in the grand final after more than half a century without winning a premiership. Tillie approaches Centrelink to review the decision to offset their FTB lump sum payment against their FTB debt so that they can buy tickets to the final. However, Centrelink determines this is insufficient reason to review the offsetting arrangements.

Example

: Lou requires emergency surgery after injuring their knee on a recent ski trip. Lou’s private health insurance provider will cover most of the costs of the surgery. To help pay for the remaining cost, Lou asks Centrelink to refund all of their FTB top-up, which was used to offset an existing FA debt. Centrelink finds that Lou has other funds available that can cover the remaining costs of the surgery, and does not refund the offset amount.

Example

: Kit’s child requires emergency surgery after an accident at school, but Kit cannot fully afford the upfront costs of the surgery. To help with surgery costs, Kit asks Centrelink to review the arrangement to offset their fortnightly FTB entitlement against their FTB debt. Centrelink reviews the offsetting arrangement and determines that part of the offset amount may be refunded to cover Kit’s shortfall.

Example

: The majority of Lav’s FTB top-up was used to fully offset their existing FA debt. Lav contacts Centrelink requesting that the offset amount be refunded as they have an overdue utility bill, they are falling behind in their credit card and personal loan repayments, and have run out of food. Centrelink reviews the decision and decides not to refund the offset amount, and instead provides Lav with a referral to an emergency relief provider, who supplies a grocery pack and a utility voucher. Centrelink also discusses the option of applying for an FTB advance payment, and provides Lav with a referral to a financial counselling service to assist with debt consolidation.

Act reference:

2.1.1.11 Full-time study requirement

Summary

This topic discusses the requirements for a child aged 16 to 19 years to be a senior secondary school child and covers the following:

full-time study requirement

determination of 'full-time study hours', and

exemptions from the full-time study requirement.

Full-time study requirement

An

FTB

child aged 16 to 19 years (up to the end of the calendar year in which they turn 19) is a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

) if the child is either:

undertaking full-time study (

1.1.F.60

) in an approved course that would allow the individual to complete the final year of secondary school or an equivalent level of education

studying overseas full-time in a course that would result in a level of education that is broadly equivalent to an Australian qualification, or

the child is exempt from the full-time study requirement for secondary school children.

For FTB purposes, qualifications at the Certificate II level or above, as defined under the Australian Qualifications Framework, are considered equivalent to the final year of secondary school. However, courses such as Access 10 (or similar), which are identified as being an alternative to the year 10 certificate, are not considered equivalent to the final year of secondary school for FTB purposes.

Determination of 'full-time study hours'

Where considered appropriate, given the child's circumstances, a determination may be made that a certain number of hours of study per week for the child, averaged over the period that the child is enrolled in a course, constitutes that child's normal amount of full-time study. Such a determination will allow the child to be considered a senior secondary student, even though it may be a reduced study load when compared to the full-time load for that course. Such a determination does not amount to an exemption from full-time study.

The discretion to make such a determination is to be exercised in accordance with the following categories:

Adjusted full-time load categories

Situation

Near completion of course

The child has almost completed their final year of secondary school or equivalent level of education and is undertaking their final units, which are equal to less hours than would be the full-time study load for that course.

Reduced capacity

There is a locally accessible approved course of education or study (including any such course available by distance education), but the capacity of the child to undertake the course is reduced to an adjusted load because the child has any of the following:

disability - physical, psychiatric or intellectual or learning disability such as attention deficit disorder

medical circumstances - such as an accident, illness or injury

personal circumstances - such as substance abuse, behavioural problem, extreme bullying

family circumstances - such as death in the family, domestic violence, family eviction, caring responsibilities

other circumstances considered appropriate (does not include the child mixing part-time study with part-time work).

Explanation:

A favourable determination should not be made in circumstances where the reason the child is undertaking a study load that is less than a normal full-time study load for a course is because the child is combining part-time study with part-time work. The purpose of a determination under this section is to recognise that the child is undertaking a level of study according to their capacity to do so. Unlike an exemption, a determination under this section recognises that the child has some capacity to undertake study.

Example:

Michael has enrolled in a bridging course at

TAFE

designed to enable them to complete their year 12 certificate. Because Michael has attention deficit disorder, the TAFE has allowed Michael extra time to complete the course. Although studying less than a normal full-time load, the course coordinator has provided written confirmation that the level of study per week that Michael is undertaking is the maximum level of study of which they are capable. Michael's mother, Sarah, provides the information from the course coordinator, as well as medical evidence from Michael's doctor, to Centrelink. As Michael is able to undertake study, but at a reduced capacity due to their learning disability, Centrelink decides to approve an 'adjusted full-time study load' for Michael.

The forms of evidence in the above example are indicative only. Depending on the circumstances, it may be necessary to confirm the child's capacity to participate in education at a reduced level from a range of sources. These could include, but not be limited to:

educational institutions

state welfare and housing agencies

real estate agents

medical personnel

social workers

bereavement counsellors

funeral directors, and

other authorities and/or individuals who are in a position to provide this confirmation.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 22B(2A) Determination of full-time study hours

Exemptions from the full-time study requirement

There will be certain circumstances when a child aged 16 to 19 years (up to the end of the calendar year in which they turn 19) can be exempted from the requirement to undertake full-time study. Exemptions can be granted under the following circumstances:

Situation

Description of situation

No approved course or place

There is no locally accessible approved course, or place available on an approved course, of education or study (including any such course available by distance education).

Individual not qualified

There is a locally accessible approved course of education or study (including any such course available by distance education), but the child is not qualified to undertake the course.

Individual lacks capacity

There is a locally accessible approved course of education or study (including any such course available by distance education), but the child lacks capacity to undertake the course because the child has a physical, psychiatric or intellectual disability or a learning disability such as attention deficit disorder.

Special circumstances

Special circumstances exist that make it unreasonable to require the child to undertake an approved course of education or study for any of the following reasons:

medical circumstances - such as an accident, illness or injury

personal circumstances - such as substance abuse, behavioural problem, extreme bullying

family circumstances - such as death in the family, domestic violence, family eviction, caring responsibilities

other circumstances considered appropriate.

An exemption from the requirement to undertake full-time study can be either permanent or temporary. A temporary exemption will not be granted for longer than 12 months, but may be renewed after 12 months if it is determined that the circumstances that warranted the original exemption remain. The following provides some examples of both temporary and permanent exemptions.

Example:

Simone is 18 years old and has completed year 10, but they left school part way through year 11. Simone has been advised by their career guidance counsellor, to whom they were referred by their social worker, of a suitable course at a registered training organisation that would enable them to complete their year 12 equivalent qualification in 6 months of study. The course is not open for enrolments until the second half of the year, which is 6 months away. However, there is no other course available, either locally or by distance education, that would allow Simone to obtain their year 12 equivalent qualification by the end of the year and provide them with the necessary credits to apply for university in their chosen field of study. Simone's career guidance counsellor provides written evidence that it is best for Simone's future educational and career prospects that they wait to enrol in this course. Upon considering this evidence, Centrelink provides Simone with a 6 month exemption and their mother, Chrystal, remains eligible for FTB Part A for Simone for this period.

Example:

Mary's daughter, Judy, has a severe intellectual disability that means Judy does not have the capacity to undertake any form of study. Judy is about to turn 16 years of age. Mary advises Centrelink of Judy's condition and provides appropriate medical evidence, and is granted a permanent exemption from the requirement to undertake full-time study. Provided the other eligibility criteria are met, Mary will remain eligible for FTB Part A for Judy, even though Judy is not in full-time study.

Example:

Kara is undertaking their final year of secondary school and is in the first trimester of pregnancy. Kara is experiencing morning sickness which has led to them missing significant amount of school and they are falling behind in their classes. Kara is advised by one of their teachers that unless their results improve, they will fail their course. Kara decides to leave school until after their baby is born. Kara seeks an exemption so their mother, Galina, will continue to be eligible for FTB Part A. Centrelink seeks evidence regarding Kara's capacity from their GP and the appropriateness of the course from Kara's educational institution. Kara's GP advises that the severity of Kara's morning sickness would interfere with their ability to regularly and reliably attend school full-time, but not their ability to undertake study. Kara's education institution advises one of their subjects requires Kara to undertake practical components which are not appropriate given the pregnancy. A guidance counsellor works with Kara to develop a plan to split Kara's subjects over 2 years using a combination of school based and distance courses the school would make available to allow them to attain their year 12 certificate. Kara still chooses to leave school before finishing the 2-year program. On the basis of the evidence provided, Centrelink does not grant Kara an exemption and Galina ceases to be eligible for FTB Part A for Kara.

The forms of evidence in the above examples are indicative only. Depending on the circumstances, it may be necessary to confirm the child's need for an exemption from a range of sources. These could include, but not be limited to:

educational institutions

state welfare and housing agencies

real estate agents

medical personnel

social workers

bereavement counsellors

funeral directors, and

other authorities and/or individuals who are in a position to provide this confirmation.

4.3.1.40 Payment of arrears - financial hardship

Summary

Administrative guidelines require requests for revocation of any

FTB

delivery method choices, in the first instance, to be applied prospectively.

However, FTB arrears may be paid upon the individual's request only in circumstances where financial hardship has been proven. Each request for payment of arrears should be assessed on an individual basis. In such circumstances arrears cannot be paid without a prior determination that hardship exists.

Centrelink will conduct individual assessments to consider the individual's financial circumstances at the time of the request and the availability of funds needed to cover exceptional expenses. For arrears to be paid, an individual must provide a reasonable explanation supporting the fact that financial hardship would result if payment of arrears was not granted.

The expectation is that the delegate would be able to make the determination of financial hardship on the basis of information provided by the individual over the phone and that documentation would not be required.

Example:

A family have just had their first child and are uncertain what their income will be for this income year. Rather than take the risk of receiving an overpayment they elect to receive the base rate of FTB Part A and wait until the end of the income year to receive any additional FTB Part A they may be entitled to. Part way through the year the family's income stabilises and they decide to revoke their choice, as the risk of an overpayment is now minimal. However, due to unforeseen medical expenses relating to the child, the family also ask for arrears of FTB Part A to be paid. Centrelink assess the family's income and expenses and determines that the family could not reasonably meet their medical expenses and would experience considerable financial hardship if arrears were not paid. Centrelink will determine the family's entitlement to FTB Part A based on their estimated family income and pay the difference between the entitlement and what they have already received.

7.3.2.40 Waiver in relation to settlements

Summary

Centrelink can agree to settle a debt (

1.1.D.60

) for less than the amount outstanding in the following situations:

civil action

proceedings during the

ART

review or ART second review

when 80% of the debt has already been recovered and the debtor cannot repay more

when the debtor offers to repay at least the present value of the outstanding amount, and it would take at least a year to otherwise recover the amount, and the debtor cannot repay more.

Where a debt has been settled for less than the value of the debt, the balance of the debt must be waived (

1.1.W.10

). More information about these situations is provided later in this topic.

Civil action

If legal action has been taken to recover a debt, and the Commonwealth has agreed to settle for an amount that is less than the full amount of the debt, Centrelink must waive recovery of the balance of the debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 100(1) Settlement of civil action, section 141 Settlement of proceedings before the ART

Proceedings before the ART

If Centrelink has agreed to settle a debt for less than the full amount of the debt in proceedings before the ART, Centrelink must waive recovery of the balance of the debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 100(2) Settlement of proceedings before the ART

80% of the debt already recovered

Centrelink must waive recovery of up to 20% of the original value of the debt if the debtor:

has repaid at least 80% of the original value of the debt, and

is unable to repay the remaining balance (see example).

Example:

Michael has a debt of $10,000. He has $8,500 in a bank account, but is unemployed with low job prospects. Recovery of his debt by deduction from his ongoing

FTB

entitlement would take a number of years. Michael offers to repay $8,500 in satisfaction of the debt. Centrelink agrees to settle the debt, and waives recovery of the remaining balance of $1,500.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 100(3) Waiver where at least 80% of debt recovered and debtor cannot pay more

Repayment of present value

Centrelink may agree to settle a debt for less than the unpaid amount of the debt if:

the debtor cannot repay more than the agreed amount, and

it would take at least a year to recover the unpaid amount using another method of recovery.

Centrelink must waive the difference between the agreed amount and the unpaid amount of the debt.

The rest of this topic provides information about calculating the present value of the debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 100(4) Agreement for part-payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt, section 100(5) Limits on agreement to accept part-payment in satisfaction of outstanding debt

Working out the present value of the debt

The present value of the unpaid amount of a debt is worked out using the following formula:

Present value = (Annual repayment ÷ interest) × (1 - (1 ÷ (1 + interest)

repayment period

))

The annual repayment is the amount of the debt that would have been recovered in a year if it were not being waived. The interest rate is declared by the Minister in a disallowable instrument (

1.1.D.90

). The interest rate is currently 5% per annum. The repayment period, expressed in years, is the number of annual repayments required to repay the unpaid amount.

Example:

Stuart had a debt of $15,000. He has already repaid $3,000 leaving an unpaid amount of $12,000. Stuart offers to make a lump sum repayment of $9,500, and shows he is unable to repay more. Centrelink works out that the annual repayment of the debt is $1,300 per year based on a repayment of $50 per fortnight. The repayment period works out to 9.23 years.

The present value of the debt is worked out as follows:

Present value = (Annual repayment ÷ interest) × (1 - (1 ÷ (1 + interest)

repayment period

))

= ($1,300 ÷ 0.05) × (1 - (1 ÷ 1.05

9.23

))

= $26,000 × (1 - 0.6374)

= $26,000 × 0.363

= $9,438

As the amount offered to settle the debt is more than the present value of the debt, Centrelink agrees to accept the lump sum in full satisfaction of the debt. Recovery of the remaining $2,500 is waived.

4.13.2.40 ACCS (child wellbeing) - provider eligible enrolment

Summary

In most cases, children eligible for

ACCS

(child wellbeing) should be enrolled under a

CWA

enrolment (

4.13.2.10

). In rare circumstances, an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) may be unable to identify a parent (

1.1.P.10

) or carer who is eligible for

CCS

for a child at risk of serious neglect or abuse. In these limited circumstances, as a last resort, the approved provide may enrol (

1.1.E.25

) the child under an ACCS (child wellbeing) provider eligible arrangement (PEA).

PEA enrolments are only permitted where:

the provider is not able to identify a parent or carer who is eligible for CCS

the child is in a formal foster or kinship care arrangement.

Where the provider is not able to identify an individual who is eligible for CCS

Before an approved provider creates a PEA enrolment for a child in this situation, they must first contact the Department of Education for approval.

A PEA enrolment in these circumstances should end when either the child is no longer considered ‘at risk’, or the approved provider has identified a parent or carer who is eligible for CCS.

Where the child is in a formal foster or kinship care arrangement

A PEA enrolment in these circumstances can be used for a maximum of 13 weeks while the carer is assessed for CCS. The PEA enrolment must be ended after 13 weeks, or once the carer is assessed for CCS, whichever comes first.

Required information for a PEA

In order for ACCS (child wellbeing) to apply to sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) submitted under a PEA enrolment, the approved provider must ensure there is an ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate (

1.1.C.15

), or an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination (

1.1.D.78

) in effect for the child at the child care service for the weeks in which care is provided.

The following details must be provided accurately in an ACCS (child wellbeing) - approved provider eligible enrolment:

child name

child

DOB

and

CRN

*

enrolment start date (the date the certificate was given)

whether care is expected to be provided on a routine or casual basis, or both

the days and times of any routine sessions of care (if applicable), and

the usual fees to be charged for any routine sessions of care (or if there are none, a usual casual rate).

*The child’s parent or carer will need to provide the approved provider with the child’s CRN before they can create the PEA enrolment. If the child does not have a CRN, the parent of carer will need to contact Services Australia to organise one.

Children on a PEA enrolment must still meet the CCS immunisation requirements (

1.1.I.10

).

1.1.E.40 Entitlement period end day code (EPEDC)

Usage

For the purposes of

FTB

, the term EPEDC is used to refer to the particular entitlement period in a fortnight that has been assigned to an FTB instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

).

EPEDCs

The FTB delivery day (

1.1.P.73

) is normally 14 days from the date of claim. If the claim is determined before the system strips payment information for the first delivery day, the first instalment period will be either 11 or 13 days to allow for the 2 days needed to issue the payment. It is more likely that the claim will be determined after the end of the first entitlement period. If this is the case, the arrears will include payment for the full 14-day period.

The following table shows the relationship between EPEDCs and payment delivery day codes, and the number of days in the first period if the claim is determined before the end of the first period.

claim.

Initial CCS payment following new CCS claim

Following an initial determination of eligibility, payment of CCS or

ACCS

entitlement will be made either to the approved provider (

), or the individual. The payment recipient (

1.1.R.07

) depends on the timing of the submission of session reports (

1.1.S.35

) by the approved provider and the approval of the individual's claim (

1.1.C.27

) for CCS.

There are 2 possible scenarios.

Scenario 1:

The individual makes an effective CCS claim before the approved provider submits any session reports for the child. The initial payment will be made to the provider.

Example:

Oscar submits a claim for CCS on 6 September 2023 and is found to be eligible and entitled to CCS. His eligibility to CCS is backdated to 21 August (as this date is not more than 28 days before the claim was made, and it is the first Monday of a CCS fortnight). His son Alex commences child care on 10 September 2023. As no session reports were submitted for Alex before Oscar's effective CCS claim was lodged, Oscar's initial (and subsequent) CCS payments will be paid to the approved provider, once they start submitting session reports for Alex.

Scenario 2:

The individual makes an effective CCS claim after the approved provider has already submitted session reports. The initial payment will be made to the individual.

Example:

Charlotte commences at a child care service on 10 July 2023. Her mother, Matilda submits a claim for CCS on 23 August 2023 and is found to be eligible and entitled to CCS. Her eligibility is backdated to 7 August 2023 (as this date is not more than 28 days before the claim was made, and it is the first Monday of a CCS fortnight). Charlotte's approved provider starts to submit session reports from 15 July 2023 (the end of the first week that Charlotte attended care). Matilda's initial CCS payment, for care already reported between 7 August and 23 August 2023, will be paid directly to Matilda (the CCS claimant). For care reported from 23 August onwards, Matilda's CCS entitlement will be paid directly to the approved provider.

4.6.1 General provisions for making a claim for CCS by fee reduction

Introduction

This section contains topics on the general provisions applying to an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) claim (

1.1.C.27

) for

CCS

by fee reduction. It covers:

the claim process

who should make a claim for CCS

when individuals should make a claim for CCS, and

how individuals can make a claim for CCS.

Claim process

An individual must make a claim in respect of a child to be eligible and entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to be paid CCS or

ACCS

. The CCS claim process involves 4 main functions:

determining if a claim is effective (

4.6.1.10

)

where a claim is effective, making an initial determination of eligibility based on whether the individual and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) (if applicable) meets the basic eligibility requirements (

4.6.1.20

)

collecting additional information needed to determine how much CCS or ACCS an individual is entitled to be paid for eligible sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided to the child/ren (

4.6.1.20

), and

determining if the individual is eligible to be paid ACCS (grandparent) (

2.8.2.10

).

Who should make a CCS claim

Only individuals can make a claim for CCS. In a two-parent family, it is recommended the individual who enters into the

CWA

with the approved provider (

1.1.A.90

), also lodges the claim for CCS. It is also possible for that individual's partner to claim, and be eligible, to receive CCS.

Individuals who are unsure if their combined

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) will be at or higher than the upper income threshold (at which CCS entitlement is zero) (

1.1.I.70

), should lodge a claim (

1.1.C.27

) for CCS but may provide an estimated ATI of more than the upper income threshold. This will ensure this individual can receive any CCS they may be entitled to after the end of the year income review process, should their combined actual ATI be less than the upper income threshold for that financial year.

When individuals should make a claim for CCS

Individuals should lodge their CCS claim either before, or as soon as possible after, enrolling their child for care with an approved child care service. As the date of effect for an initial determination of entitlement can only be backdated to the first Monday of a CCS fortnight that is not more than 28 days before the claim was made, individuals may be disadvantaged if they do not lodge their claim promptly.

A claim can remain active for up to 52 consecutive weeks without the individual receiving CCS or ACCS.

How individuals can make a claim for CCS

Most individuals will lodge and manage their CCS claim using Centrelink online services.

Individuals who cannot access this service have alternative options to make a CCS claim with Centrelink, including staff assisted processes over the phone or in person at a Centrelink office.

1.1.G.15 Grandparent carer (FTB Part B)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

Part B, a grandparent is a parent of a parent of a child (including step-parents).

A great-grandparent is a parent of a grandparent of a child (including step-parents).

An individual is also considered to be a grandparent if they are the former partner of a natural, adoptive or relationship grandparent or great-grandparent (

1.1.R.22

).

For the purposes of the above, definitions are:

a parent is a natural, adoptive, relationship or step-parent of a child, and

a step-parent is the partner or former partner of a natural, adoptive or relationship parent of a child.

Example:

Rona is caring for Mitchell who is the son of Barb. Rona is Barb's natural parent and therefore is the grandparent of Mitchell.

Example:

Robert is caring for Sarah who is the adoptive daughter of Renee. Robert is Renee's natural parent and is considered Sarah's grandparent because Renee is considered to be Sarah's parent.

Example:

Albert is caring for a child named Joe. Although he is not Joe's biological great-grandparent, he is considered a great-grandparent for FTB purposes because:

Albert is Margaret's biological father

Margaret is Stuart's adoptive parent

Stuart is a relationship parent of Joe.

Example:

Kevin is caring for Charlie, who is the child of his ex-partner's (Tracey) adoptive daughter Sarah. Kevin is considered a grandparent because Tracey is considered Sarah's parent, and in turn Sarah is Charlie's parent.

1.1.I.10 Immunisation requirements (FTB, CCS)

Summary

For the purposes of

FTB

Part A and

CCS

, a child is 'immunised' where the child is up-to-date and not overdue with vaccinations required in accordance with the age appropriate childhood schedule (birth to 4 years) or on a catch up schedule according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook (

2.1.3.30

). A child may also have an approved exemption from meeting immunisation requirements.

For the purposes of CCS, all children must meet the above requirements (

2.1.3.20

) in order to receive payment.

Where immunisation requirements are not met for children aged under 20 years, an individual's FTB Part A child rate will be reduced (

2.1.3.10

).

Note:

For income years from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, an individual's FTB Part A end of year supplement was withheld where immunisation requirements were not met (

8.1.2

).

For the purposes of FTB Part A and CCS, the child's immunisation status, which is held by the

Australian Immunisation Register

(AIR), is automatically checked in daily electronic reports from the AIR to Centrelink. Where the AIR has not confirmed that immunisation requirements are met, the child will be regarded as not meeting the requirements.

4.3.3 Instalments paid by direct credit

Summary

Payment of

FTB

by instalments and

SBP

are generally made by direct credit unless an exemption has been granted. This topic covers direct credit payments and reasons for exemption from the direct credit requirement.

Direct credit requirement

A claim for FTB is not effective unless the applicant either provides bank account details, or makes a statement that they will provide bank account details within 28 days from the day the claim is lodged. This requirement applies to both an individual and an

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

).

The claim cannot be determined until the account details have been provided. This means that the applicant cannot be paid even if they have made a statement undertaking to provide account details within 28 days of lodging the claim.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.2

Claims for FTB

Account types

Payment can be made to a:

bank

credit union, or

building society.

The individual must maintain the account, either solely or jointly with another person or organisation. This means that the account must have the individual's name, either alone or with another person. It is not sufficient for the individual to have access to another person's account. The following table shows what types of account are acceptable for FTB purposes.

Type of account

Account acceptable for direct credit?

Savings account (debit)

Yes

Cheque account (debit)

Yes

Debit account with a credit limit, including those with a linked credit card.

Yes

Explanation:

Even though the individual is allowed to overdraw the account, it is still a debit account.

Credit card account

Examples:

Visa, MasterCard.

No

Explanation:

Credit card accounts are not directly administered by the issuing financial institution.

Note:

An individual may have a credit card which has other accounts linked to it for electronic banking and

EFTPOS

. The debit accounts linked to the card can still be nominated for direct credit purposes, although the credit card number cannot be used.

Payment to a child's account

Payment cannot be made to an account held by a child if the child is able to withdraw funds independently of the individual in receipt of FTB. In this case, the individual is deemed not to maintain the account.

However, payment can be made to an account:

held in trust for a child by the individual in receipt of FTB, or

in the child's name, where withdrawals can only be made by the individual in receipt of FTB. In this case the individual is deemed to be maintaining the account.

Exemptions from direct credit

Note:

The following only applies to exemptions from direct credit for FTB by instalment.

An individual who is granted an exemption from the direct credit requirement can be paid by other means.

Example:

Payment by other means may occur due to the individual:

not having a bank account and requires time to obtain and provide the details of the direct credit account, and

being temporarily disabled or staying in a remote or isolated area (

1.1.R.30

) and is unable to get access to their account, or

requiring a payment immediately and this cannot be done in time through the direct credit system or does not have a bank account.

When a direct credit exemption ends the Secretary may require bank account details to be provided by the individual. If the individual fails to comply with this requirement within 28 days, the Secretary may determine the individual is not entitled to be paid FTB for any day that the determination was in place.

4.4.4 Reassessment of FTB - income support cancelled  or employment income nil rate period

Notice of request

If an

FTB

instalment recipient or their partner loses their entitlement to an income support payment or are placed on an employment income nil rate period, the FTB recipient should be sent a notice requesting a reasonable estimate of their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

).

The FTB recipient has 21 days from the date of the notice to provide an estimate of their ATI. Failure to comply with this request within the specified timeframe will result in cancellation of their FTB.

The FTB recipient's rate of FTB Part A is maintained at the pre-cancellation or suspension rate until:

the requested estimate is provided, or

the specified timeframe expires.

Date of effect of variation

The following table shows the date of effect of the variation determination.

Circumstance

Action

ATI estimate provided within the specified timeframe and resulting in an unfavourable decision (that is, a decrease in the recipient's rate of FTB).

FTB entitlement is reduced from the date of notification (or the start date of the recipient's next entitlement period where it is not actioned in time for the payday following notification).

ATI estimate provided within the specified timeframe and resulting in a favourable decision (that is, an increase in the recipient's rate of FTB).

FTB entitlement is increased from the date that the recipient notifies their new ATI estimate.

ATI estimate provided after FTB is cancelled but before the end of the income year following the income year in which the cancellation took effect.

FTB entitlement must be varied from the date of cancellation of FTB.

ATI estimate provided after the end of the income year following the income year in which the cancellation took effect.

FTB entitlement cannot be varied.

1.2.18 Newborn supplement (NBS) - description

Summary

This section includes information on:

NBS

objectives

NBS and

NBU

eligibility

claiming NBS and NBU

birth registration

NBS and NBU rate, and

how NBS and NBU are paid.

NBS objectives

The NBS, which is an add-on component of

FTB

Part A, is included in the FTB Part A rate for eligible individuals for a period of up to 13 weeks (or 91 days) to assist with the upfront costs of a newborn child, a child aged under one year who becomes entrusted (

1.1.B.17

) to the individual's care, or a child who becomes entrusted to the individual's care as part of an adoption process. The NBS provides assistance to those families not eligible for

PLP

(PPL Guide

2

).

NBU eligibility

If an individual is eligible for at least one day of NBS and is not excluded under the legislative instrument, NBU is also paid. An individual is not eligible for NBU for a child if they or their partner have previously received NBU in relation to that child. See

2.2.3

for further detail on NBU eligibility criteria.

NBS eligibility

An individual may be eligible for NBS for a day where the individual meets FTB eligibility criteria (

2.2.1

) for an FTB child born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process, and meets additional conditions under one of the following 3 categories:

parent of a child

child entrusted to care of an individual or their partner, or

adoption.

The rules for ensuring that individuals cannot receive a duplicate payment of NBS or NBU for a child are described in the legislative instrument.

See

2.2.3

for further detail on NBS and NBU eligibility criteria.

Claiming NBS & NBU

Eligibility for NBS and NBU is assessed as part of an individual's FTB claim (

4.2

). A separate claim is not required for NBS or NBU.

Where an individual has claimed FTB for a child and they or their partner have either claimed or expressed an intention to claim PLP for that child and it is determined that the individual is eligible for FTB but the PLP claim has not been made or determined, the FTB claim may be paid without the inclusion of NBS or NBU. If it is later determined that PLP is not payable for that child or the individual indicates that there is no longer an intention to claim PLP, the individual's eligibility for NBS and NBU will be assessed.

Birth registration

Where an individual or their partner is a parent of the child and are responsible for registering the birth of the child in accordance with a relevant state or territory law, the NBS birth registration requirement must also be met.

See

2.2.3

for further details on the birth registration requirements for NBS.

NBS & NBU rate

The NBS is an add-on component of the individual's FTB Part A rate for a period of 13 weeks (91 days). For more information on FTB Part A rates see

3.1.1.20

.

In addition, where an individual is eligible for NBS for one day and is not excluded under the legislative instrument (see

2.2.3

for further detail on NBS and NBU eligibility criteria), NBU is payable in respect of the first day of NBS eligibility. The NBU is a separate amount to the NBS and is not included in calculating an eligible individual's FTB Part A rate.

For more information on NBS and NBU rates see

3.11

.

NBS and NBU are also indexed annually. For more information on the indexation of NBS and NBU, see

3.1.1.60

.

How NBS & NBU are paid

NBS is paid as part of an individual's regular FTB Part A payment for a period of up to 13 weeks (91 days). NBU is paid as a single lump sum in respect of the first day of NBS eligibility.

NBS and NBU may also be paid as part of an individual's past period claim for FTB (

1.1.P.60

).

6.4.5.10 Death of individual

Executor lodges returns early

If an individual (

1.1.I.90

) in receipt of

FTB

dies part way through the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) and all the conditions for reconciliation are met before the end of that year, reconciliation will not occur until after the end of the income year.

If the individual did not have a partner during the entitlement period then reconciliation can occur immediately from 1 July of the first lodgement year. If the individual did have a partner, reconciliation occurs after the actual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of the partner becomes available.

Example:

An individual in receipt of FTB, Mrs Nbebi dies on 1 January. The executor lodges the returns in March and the estate is wound up by the end of April. Mr Nbebi lodges his tax return in August of the first lodgement year and Mrs Nbebi's entitlement is reconciled soon after and can be paid to Mr Nbebi.

If an individual in receipt of

CCS

or

ACCS

dies part way through the income year, reconciliation will occur as soon as all usage/attendance information is available, even if this is before the end of the year.

When an individual in receipt of CCS or ACCS dies in these circumstances, CCS and ACCS may be paid to a third party at the Secretary's discretion.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.6.1

General provisions for making a claim for CSS by fee reduction

Executor fails to lodge returns

For FTB, if the individual dies either during the income year, or the first lodgement year, and the executor of the estate fails to lodge the returns for the income year by 30 June of the first lodgement year then the rules for non-lodgers apply.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.3

Requirement to lodge an income tax return

Income to be used when an individual dies during an income year

Where the individual dies part way through the income year, the actual ATI of the deceased person is annualised for reconciliation purposes to bring it into line with the assessment of all other individuals in receipt of FTB, CCS and ACCS.

The formula for annualising is:

'Income of individual to date of death' means the ATI of the individual up to and including the day before they died. 'Number of days individual was alive during income year' means the number of days up to and including the day before they died.

Example:

Mrs Nbebi's ATI up to the day before the date of her death on 1 January 2001 is $15,000. Her annualised ATI for reconciliation purposes is $15,000 × 365 ÷ 184 = $29,755.

Explanation:

Only income up to the day before the individual died is included. Even if the deceased individual has income on or after the date of death (for example, bank interest, dividends, rental income) it is not included in the deceased individual's taxable income. Any income earned on or after the date of death is included in a trust tax return.

Child support means financial support under the

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

and includes financial support:

by way of lump sum payment, or

3.1.6.30 Court orders & court registered agreements

Collection methods for Stage 1

CSS

individuals

The following table outlines the collection methods for Stage 1 (

3.1.5.20

) individuals.

If an individual obtained a court order or a court registered agreement …

they …

between 1 June 1988 and 31 December 1992, and

they were a Centrelink individual

were required to have their order/agreement collected by Child Support.

between 1 June 1988 and 31 December 1992, and

they were not a Centrelink individual

could choose private collection (

1.1.P.130

) when notifying Child Support of the order/agreement.

from 1 January 1993

could choose private collection, or Child Support collection.

Explanation:

For both Child Support collection and private collection of an order/agreement, individuals lodge the relevant Child Support form through Centrelink so that Centrelink is aware what action has been taken.

If an individual receiving FTB already has a court order or court registered agreement then Centrelink must accept that agreement as reasonable maintenance action (

1.1.M.10

).

Individuals already receiving payment under the order/agreement before it is lodged with Child Support must declare the amount to Centrelink. If the order/agreement provides for:

capitalised maintenance and/or lump sum child support (

1.1.C.20

), or

non-cash maintenance

it should be recorded as maintenance income unless the order/agreement has not been complied with. If there is non-compliance, the individual should be referred to Legal Aid to seek a variation to the order/agreement to arrange for cash maintenance and collection by Child Support.

6.3.1 ART reviews

ART

review objectives

The objective of the ART review is to provide a review mechanism that is:

fair and just

informal

economical

accessible and responsive, and

transparent.

Individuals may apply to the ART for a review of a Centrelink decision if their interests are affected by an internal review decision. While the Secretary remains a party to the proceedings, in most cases the Secretary will not be an active participant in the proceedings and the matter will be reviewed using documents and records provided by Centrelink. There may be some cases where the ART will require participation by the Secretary, or the Secretary may elect to participate.

Application for a review of Centrelink decisions

Where the decision relates to the payment of

FTB

by instalments, or to the raising of a debt, there is no time limit for applying for an ART review. However, date of effect rules in the

FA

law may limit the amount of payments that an individual can receive when a decision is made in their favour. It is therefore important that applications for review are lodged with the ART at the individual's earliest convenience.

Where the decision relates to other types of FA, an application to the ART for review must be made within 90 days of the individual being notified of a decision.

Where an individual is prevented from making an application for an ART review within the allowable time due to special circumstances, the ART may permit the individual to make an application after the 90-day period and within such further period as it considers appropriate.

Applications can be made in written or oral form to an ART office or other agencies approved by Centrelink.

Review & appeal process of child support matters

See CS Guide

Part 10

for a description of child support objections and appeals processes.

Continuation of payment

If an unfavourable decision is made and the decision depends upon the exercise of discretion, the Secretary may declare that entitlement to FA may continue during the review process.

Notification of a review decision by the ART

When notifying the parties to the proceeding of the Tribunal’s review decision, the ART must give, in writing, its decision and a statement of reasons for its decision. The Tribunal must also advise if the parties have a right to apply for second ART review or notice of the right to appeal to the Federal Court. This must be provided to the parties within 28 days after the day the Tribunal makes a decision, unless otherwise specified in the ART practice directions.

Explanation:

The parties to the review include:

the applicant

the decision-maker, and

any other person who is made a party to the proceeding.

Date of effect of the decision

The following table outlines the date of effect of different ART review decisions provided a review is sought in time.

If the ART …

then the decision takes effect …

varies or sets aside a decision

from the date of the original decision.

makes a new decision

immediately after the decision is made unless the ART specifies a different date.

Non-reviewable decisions

The following decisions are not reviewable:

the form and manner of claim

the continuation of payment pending review of an unfavourable decision

the Secretary requiring information, or

the Secretary's power to settle proceedings before the ART second review.

Further review

Following an ART review decision, a party affected by the decision may apply for an ART second review. An ART review decision can also be appealed to the Federal Court (on an error of law).

2.8.1.30 ACCS (child wellbeing) - certificates

Summary

This topic describes the circumstances in which an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) can give an

ACCS

(child wellbeing) certificate (

1.1.C.15

) and covers:

circumstances where an approved provider gives a certificate

evidence to support certificates.

Circumstances where an approved provider gives a certificate

If an approved provider identifies, or is notified of, a child ‘at risk’ (

1.1.A.110

), they can give an ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate. An ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate must be given for a total period of 6 weeks, after which the approved provider can apply for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination (

1.1.D.78

) to be made.

Approved providers are only able to give a certificate for a total of 6 weeks within a 12-month period (

1.1.T.51

). If the 6 weeks has been used and the child is still at risk, ACCS can only continue to be accessed through applying for a determination.

The approved provider will need to use a new 6 weeks of certificate/s in every 12-month period before continuing to apply for determinations, if the child is still attending the service and continues to be at risk.

When the approved provider has decided to give a certificate, they must ensure:

the individual (

1.1.I.90

) or the approved provider meet the ACCS (child wellbeing) eligibility requirements in relation to a child (

2.8.1.10)

, and

the child meets the definition of 'at risk of serious abuse or neglect'

Act reference:

FAAct

85CB Certification for ACCS (child wellbeing), section 85CA Eligibility for ACCS (child wellbeing)

Evidence to support certificates

No documentary evidence needs to be provided to

CCSS

for the purpose of giving a certificate unless the approved provider is requesting to backdate the certificate beyond 28 days (up to 13 weeks in exceptional circumstances) (

2.8.1.70

).

However, the provider must keep records and evidence to support their assessment that the child is at risk, as they can be asked for it by Services Australia or the Department of Education for auditing purposes.

3.5 CCS entitlement

Introduction

This chapter explains the general provisions involved in determining an individual's

CCS

entitlement (

1.1.E.30

).

The amount of CCS an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is entitled to is dependent upon:

the combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of the individual and their partner (

1.1.P.30

), if they have one

the activity level of the individual and their partner, if they have one

the type of child care service (

1.1.A.90

) used, and whether the child attends school, and

whether the individual or their partner has 2 or more children aged 5 or under using child care and earn below the upper income threshold (

1.1.I.70

) for the higher CCS rate.

Indexation of CCS

Each financial year the CCS first income threshold will be indexed by

CPI

, and all other income thresholds will be shifted by the same dollar amount to preserve the slope of the subsidy tapers. The hourly rate caps are also indexed by CPI each financial year.

Note:

A CCS annual cap, which placed a limit on the amount of subsidy a child could receive per year, applied prior to the 2021-22 financial year and was indexed by CPI each financial year. The annual cap was removed from the 2021-22 financial year onwards.

3.5.4 Calculating CCS entitlement

Calculation

CCS

eligible individuals (

1.1.I.90

) will have their entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) calculated for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided by an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

) to a child for each week by the following method.

Step 1

Centrelink works out the individual's subsidised hours result for the CCS fortnight.

Example:

Jane works 40 hours a fortnight, her subsidised hours result is the basic hours result of 72 hours per fortnight.

Note:

Some

ACCS

entitlements have a deemed subsidised hours result of 100 hours.

Step 2

Determine what sessions of care the individual is eligible to claim (

1.1.C.27

) CCS on.

Example:

Jane has her child in child care 5 days a week, however 2 of those sessions are not eligible CCS sessions of care because the child ceased to meet the immunisation requirements (

1.1.I.10

) part way through the week. The CCS rate will only apply to the 3 CCS eligible sessions of care.

Step 3

Work out the hourly rate the individual is entitled to for the eligible sessions of care.

Example:

Jane has her child in a

CBDC

, which charges Jane $10.00 an hour. The 2025–26 CBDC subsidy cap is $14.63. Based on Jane's combined annual

ATI

of $290,000 her CCS percentage is 50% of the lower of either the hourly fee and the hourly rate cap for CBDC. The hourly rate Jane would be entitled to is $5.00 an hour (50% of the hourly fee).

Families with income below $367,563 and more than one child aged 5 or under in care can get a higher subsidy for one or more of their children. The rates for each child are worked out using two separate income tests.

The ‘standard rate child’ is usually the eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or under. The standard rate child will get the standard CCS rates. The ‘higher rate child’ is the second and any younger children aged 5 or under. A higher rate child is entitled to a higher rate of subsidy calculated using a separate income test (

3.5

).

Example:

If Jane had 2 children, who are both aged 5 and under using child care, her income tested CCS rate for her eldest child would be 50%, meaning the hourly rate she would be entitled to is $5.00 an hour (50% of the hourly fee of $10.00). Her CCS rate for her second, younger child would be calculated using a separate income test, that is, 75%. This means the hourly rate she would be entitled to for the second child is $7.50 an hour (75% of the hourly fee of $10.00).

Note:

Some ACCS entitlements will be up to 120% of the hourly rate cap.

Step 4

Apply the hourly rate to the remaining recognised participation hours for the CCS eligible sessions of care.

Example:

Jane is entitled to 72 hours of CCS eligible sessions of care per fortnight. The first week of the fortnight Jane had 3 CCS eligible sessions of care, which were 10 hours each. The basic subsidy amount the hourly rate would apply to is 30 hours for the first week. Therefore, $5.00 × 30 hours = $150.00.

For the second week of the fortnight, Jane had 5 CCS eligible sessions of care for the week, however she only has 42 subsidised hours remaining for the CCS fortnight, therefore her CCS hourly rate would only apply to the remaining 42 hours.

Step 5

The amount of CCS for an individual for the week, for the sessions of care identified in step 2, is based on the recognised participation amount.

Note:

A CCS annual cap, which placed a limit on the amount of subsidy a child could receive per year, applied prior to the 2021–22 financial year. The annual cap was removed from the 2021–22 financial year onwards.

Withholding

Prior to any CCS payment being made, a withholding percentage is applied. Withheld amounts of CCS are used to offset potential debts (

1.1.D.60

) incurred in the future at reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

). The default withholding percentage for all individuals is 5% of their total entitlement.

Example:

Jane's total CCS entitlement for the week is $100.00. Five per cent of $100.00 is $5.00. Therefore, the total payment amount of CCS that Jane's child care provider will receive on her behalf is $95.00.

To reduce the likelihood of incurring a debt after reconciliation has occurred, families can change their withholding percentage (from 0 to 100%) via their Centrelink online account through myGov (up to 2 times a year) or by contacting Centrelink directly.

Note:

There is no withholding applied to ACCS payments.

2.1.3.50 Healthy Start for School requirements (FTB)

Summary

If an individual or their partner receives an income support payment on any day that the individual is also receiving FTB Part A, and they have an FTB child that turns 4 in that income year, an age-appropriate health check must be undertaken or the FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

).

This topic covers the following:

FTB individuals affected by the health check requirement

timeframe for completing the health check

children taken to meet the health check requirement, and

consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied

FTB individuals affected by the health check requirement

If an individual is the parent (

1.1.P.10

) of an FTB child, or is partnered to the parent of an FTB child, and they or their partner receive an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) on any day that they are also receiving FTB, and their FTB child turns 4 in an income year, they are required to make sure their child has undergone the recognised health check (

2.1.3.70

) and notify Centrelink that the health check requirement is met before the child's fifth birthday.

Note:

Where an income support payment is retrospectively paid for a period during the income year in which the child turns or has turned 4, this can cause the health check requirement to apply to the individual.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied

Timeframe for completing the health check

From 2018-19, for income years in which a child turns 4, a recognised health check must be completed and Centrelink must be notified before the day on which the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).

Example:

Jayde turns 4 in the 2018-19 income year on 3 December 2018. The health check must be completed and Centrelink notified by 2 December 2019.

For income years prior to 2018-19, the health check must be completed and Centrelink must be notified by the end of the first income year after the income year in which the child turned 4.

Example:

Ebony turns 4 in the 2017-18 income year. The health check must be completed and Centrelink notified by 30 June 2019.

If the child dies at any time within the one year timeframe for income years prior to 2018-19, the health check requirement will not apply in relation to the child and the individual entitled to FTB Part A in relation to the child will receive the FTB Part A supplement for the relevant income year as normal. Similarly, for income years from 2018-19, if the child dies before their fifth birthday or any later days determined by Centrelink, the health check requirement will not apply in relation to that child and the FTB child rate will not be reduced.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied, section 61D Death of an FTB child

Children taken to meet the health check requirement

Where the FTB child is taking or has already undertaken health assessments suitable to their particular circumstances, the child is taken to meet the health check requirement. In these cases an additional health assessment is not required.

Children in this category are:

From 2018-19 onwards, a child who qualifies their carer for

CP

,

CA

or a

HCC

(because the carer is qualified for CA for the child, either alone or with another care receiver) at any time from the beginning of the income year in which the child turned 4 to the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).

From 2018-19 onwards, a child assessed by a medical practitioner as having a severe disability or severe medical condition and who has undergone, during the period beginning the day the child turns 3 and ending the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday), a health assessment suitable to their needs conducted by a suitably qualified health professional.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A(9) Legislative instrument

Family Tax Benefit (Meeting the Health Check Requirement) Determination 2018

section 8 Classes of children taken to meet the health check requirement

Consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement

A reduction to an individual's FTB child rate will be applied from the child's fifth birthday if the health check requirement is not met, or if the individual does not notify Centrelink that a health check has been completed, by the child's fifth birthday. The reduction will apply for the corresponding number of days that an individual or their partner received FTB Part A and an income support payment during the income year the child turned 4.

An individual may have until a later day determined by Centrelink by which to meet the health check requirement. This later day can be no later than the child's sixth birthday.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A Reduction in FTB child rate unless health check requirement satisfied

Children taken to meet the health check requirement 2012-13 to 2017-18

Where the FTB child is taking or has already undertaken health assessments suitable to their particular circumstances, the child is taken to meet the health check requirement. In these cases an additional health assessment is not required.

Children in this category are:

For income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, a child who qualifies their carer for CP, CA or a HCC (because the carer is qualified for CA for the child, either alone or with another care receiver) during the income year in which the child turns 4 or within the following income year.

For income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, a child assessed by a medical practitioner as having a severe disability or severe medical condition and who has undergone, within the period from when the child turned 3 years of age, until the end of the second income year after the income year in which the child turned 4, an assessment suitable to their needs conducted by a suitably qualified health professional for income years prior to 2012-13. Similarly, if the child is assessed by a medical practitioner as above before the end of the first income year where the relevant income year is 2012-13 or later the same rule applies.

Consequences of failing to meet the health check requirement for income years 2012-13 to 2017-18

If the health check requirement applies and is not met, or the individual does not notify Centrelink that a health check has been completed by the end of the first income year after their child turned 4 for income years from 2012-13 to 2017-18, part or all of their FTB Part A supplement for the child will be withheld, even if the individual meets the tax lodgement requirements for that income year.

The individual's FTB Part A supplement will be reviewed if the health check requirement is met by the end of the first income year after the income year in which their child turned 4 for income years 2012-13 to 2017-18.

3.2.2 Taxable income

Summary

This topic contains information about the following:

taxable income

taxable income for individuals whose income has been assessed by the

ATO

, and

taxable income for individuals whose income has not been assessed by the ATO.

Taxable income

Taxable income has the same meaning as in the

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

. It is the amount of assessable income received for a relevant income year, less any allowable deductions.

Generally, all taxable income is taken into account when the rate of

FTB

for individual families is calculated. Taxable income is generally earned from employment type activities. However, if the individual or family has some non-employment type income such as pensions, government allowances and payments, which may be taxable, this income also needs to be taken into account to determine the rate of FTB. Other forms of income that should be accounted for include business income, capital gains and passive income such as interest and dividends.

Some scholarships are taxable. Details of whether a scholarship is taxable or not should be available from the scholarship provider.

Example:

Cathy receives FTB for her 2 daughters. She has also been awarded a part-time PhD scholarship by Queensland University. Because the income provided from her part-time scholarship is deemed taxable, Cathy must update her FTB income estimate to include her scholarship income. Cathy's friend, Rhonda, is also receiving FTB for her son Charlie and has been awarded a non-taxable scholarship by Queensland University to undertake her PhD. Rhonda does not need to update her FTB income estimate to include her scholarship income because her full-time scholarship is deemed to be exempt income.

FAAct

section 3(1)-'taxable income'

Policy reference:

SS Guide

4.3.9.40

Income from scholarships

Taxable income for individuals whose income has been assessed by the ATO

The ATO assesses taxable income and advises taxpayers of the amount on a notice of assessment. This amount is used to assess taxable income for FTB and

CCS

purposes and can also be used as evidence of income for the SBP income test (

4.15.1

).

The SBP income test is based on the 6-month period beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery and the assessment will be based on the individual's estimate of taxable income during that period.

For the purposes of

FA

, any assessable First Home Super Saver released amount (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) that may be included in the recipient's taxable income is disregarded.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 2 Adjusted taxable income

Taxable income for individuals whose income has not been assessed by the ATO

If an individual or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) is not required to lodge a tax return and has therefore not had their income assessed by the ATO, they may be required to notify Centrelink, and may need to provide an estimate of their taxable income, depending on the type of claim they are making. Even if income is below the tax-free threshold, it is classed as taxable income and assessed for FTB and CCS purposes, as well as for SBP income test purposes. A loss is treated as zero taxable income.

Example:

Maria has taxable income of $38,000 from employment. Maria's partner Joe has estimated $5,500 income from investments. Joe has not paid tax on the investment income as it is below the tax-free threshold. The income, however, is taxable and is added to Maria's taxable income, resulting in a combined taxable income of $43,500.

1.4.4 Liability of decision makers

Decisions subject to a right of review under the Act

A person affected by a decision of an officer under

FA

law may apply for a review of the decision.

DSS

, the Department of Education, Centrelink, Medicare Australia or the

ATO

should not accept liability if an incorrect decision has been made under FA law when there is a right of review available to the person.

Liability when giving advice

Liability will generally not arise if the reason for the advice being incorrect was that the individual had provided incorrect information and there was no reason for the staff member to query the accuracy of that information.

No liability will arise if the advice was incorrect because the officer reached a view of the law that was reasonable.

However, the officer may be negligent if they:

failed to check the relevant law, or

carelessly misread a clear statement of the law.

Avoiding liability when giving advice

To ensure reasonable care is taken when giving advice, staff should do the following:

ensure that they obtain and understand all relevant facts

ensure that the relevant law is identified and understood

apply the law to the facts to give advice that is easy to understand and accurate. The staff member should ensure that they understand why the advice is required and tailor the advice to the needs of the individual

when the staff member does not know the answer to the question, they should inform the individual that they will contact them after obtaining the relevant information

when there are still doubts about the reliability of the information or the authority of the staff member to provide advice, these should be made known to the individual

in some circumstances, suggest to individuals that they should seek independent advice from suitably qualified people

ensure the individual understands when the advice or information given is of an interim or conditional nature

ensure the individual is advised that their question is ultimately for the courts to determine and that they should not rely on Centrelink advice if information or advice is sought on a question of legal interpretation. Where advice is sought on this basis, the individual should be advised to seek an independent opinion on the law and its statutory interpretation, and

in some circumstances, indicate that while all care is taken in providing the information or advice, no responsibility is accepted for any loss incurred as a result.

Where Centrelink is the authoritative source

Disclaimers of the kind recommended above are not appropriate if Centrelink is the only authoritative source of information or advice on a matter and it is reasonable for Centrelink to provide it.

Call centres

The Attorney-General's Department has advised that liability may arise if advice is issued by a call centre. Centrelink actively encourages individuals to use call centres as the first point of contact. Individuals are entitled to assume that if unconditional advice is provided by a Centrelink call centre, they can rely on that advice without taking further action.

Call centre staff must ensure that advice given is correct and, if in doubt, that the individual is advised of this doubt and given the option to have the matter referred to an area that can answer the individual's query.

1.1.I.105 Interim period (FTB)

Definition

The interim period begins on the first day that the actual care of the child ceased to correspond with the care provided for under the care arrangement. The length of the interim period depends on a number of factors, including:

whether the care arrangement is specified under a court order, parenting plan or written agreement

when the care arrangement was made

when the disputed care change occurred, and

whether the person with increased care is taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.

The maximum interim period will apply in situations where the person with increased care does not take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution at any time during that period. See

2.1.1.70

for more information on interim periods.

1.1.I.70 Income thresholds (CCS)

Definition

For the purposes of

CCS

, income thresholds are used to identify the applicable percentage of CCS (

1.1.A.70

) when determining an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) CCS entitlement (

1.1.E.30

).

Standard CCS rate thresholds

This table shows the standard CCS rates based on the combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of the individual and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) (if they have one):

Combined family income

Subsidy per cent of the actual fee charged (up to relevant percentage of the hourly rate cap)

Up to $85,279

90%

More than $85,279 to below $535,279

Tapering to 0%*

$535,279 or more

0%

*Subsidy tapers down by 1% for each $5,000 of family income.

Higher CCS rate thresholds

Families with multiple children aged 5 or under who are CCS-eligible may receive a higher CCS rate for their second and younger children. This higher rate is up to a maximum rate of 95%. Families will continue to receive the standard CCS rate for all other children.

Combined family income

Subsidy per cent of the actual fee charged (up to relevant percentage of the hourly rate cap)

Up to $143,273

95%

More than $143,273 to below $188,273

Decreasing to 80% by 1% for each $3,000 of family income

$188,273 to below $267,563

80%

$267,563 to below $357,563

Decreasing to 50% by 1% for each $3,000 of family income

$357,563 to below $367,563

50%

$367,563 or more

Higher CCS rates no longer apply, all children in the family receive the standard CCS rate

If CCS eligibility for one or more children stops, entitlement to higher CCS for other children aged 5 or under may be reassessed.

Children who are entitled to both the higher CCS rate and

ACCS

will be paid the ACCS rate.

Sessions of

IHC

do not attract the higher subsidy for younger children. This is because IHC is subsidised on a family rather than per child basis.

However, children aged 5 or under in IHC are included in the family unit when determining access to the higher CCS rate.

The income thresholds for both standard CCS rates and higher CCS rates will be indexed by

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year and the other thresholds will be increased accordingly. The figures in this table relate to the 2025–26 income year.

Explanation:

The lower income threshold is subject to indexation (

1.1.I.80

). For CCS purposes, the indexed amounts take effect from the first Monday after the last CCS fortnight that began in the last financial year ends. For the 2025–26 financial year, the indexed CCS rates are effective from Monday 7 July 2025.

1.1.A.70 Applicable percentage (CCS)

Definition

An individual's (

1.1.I.90

) applicable percentage is the rate of subsidy an individual is entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to for a session of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided to a child in a

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

). The applicable percentage is calculated based on the combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of the individual and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) (if they have one). An individual’s applicable percentage may also be higher if they have more than one child aged 5 or younger.

Standard CCS rates

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or below $85,279 the applicable percentage will be 90%.

If an individual's combined annual ATI is above $85,279 and below $535,279 the applicable percentage will gradually reduce from 90% to 0%, tapering down by 1% for each $5,000 of family income. To calculate an individual's applicable percentage in this income threshold (

1.1.I.70

), the following formula is used and the result rounded to 2 decimal places:

90 - [(combined annual income - lower income (base rate) threshold ($85,279)) ÷ 5,000]

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or above $535,279 the applicable percentage will be zero per cent. That is, while the individual may be eligible for CCS, they will not have any entitlement to CCS.

Higher CCS rates for multiple children

Note:

Calculations for higher CCS rates use the higher CCS rate thresholds.

Families with more than one child aged 5 or under in care may get a higher subsidy rate for their second child and younger children.

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or below $143,273 the applicable percentage will be 95% for second and younger children.

If an individual's combined annual ATI is above $143,273 and below $188,273 the applicable percentage will gradually reduce from 95% to 80%, tapering down by 1% for each $3,000 of family income. To calculate an individual's applicable percentage in this income threshold, the following formula is used and the result rounded to 2 decimal places:

115 - [(combined annual income - lower income (other rate) threshold ($83,273)) ÷ 3,000]

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or above $188,273 and below $267,563 the applicable percentage will be 80%.

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or above $267,563 and below $357,563, the applicable percentage will gradually reduce from 80% to 50%, tapering down by 1% for each $3,000 of family income. To calculate an individual's applicable percentage in this income threshold, the following formula is used and the result rounded to 2 decimal places:

80 - [(combined annual income - third income (other rate) threshold ($267,563)) ÷ 3,000]

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or above $357,563 and below $367,563 the applicable percentage will be 50%.

If an individual's combined annual ATI is equal to or above $367,563 higher CCS rates no longer apply, and all children in the family receive the standard CCS rate.

Note:

The lower income (other rate) threshold and lower income (base rate) threshold will be indexed (

1.1.I.80

) by

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year and the other thresholds will be increased accordingly.

4.4.5.40 Failure to nominate bank account details

Request for bank account details

Unless an exemption is granted, an instalment claim for

FTB

is not effective unless the individual:

provides bank account details, or

makes a statement that they will provide bank account details within 28 days from the day the claim is lodged.

This requirement applies to both an individual (

1.1.I.90

) and an

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

).

If the individual meets the requirement by making a statement that they will provide bank account details within 28 days of making the claim but fail to do so, then the claim is taken not to have been made.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 7A Bank account details or statement to be provided for claims for FTB by instalment to be effective, section 15A Restriction on determining claim where bank account details not provided

Policy reference:

4.3.3

Instalments paid by direct credit

Instalment individual fails to provide bank account details

The Secretary may require a person who is entitled to be paid FTB by instalment to provide bank account details under section 26A of the FA(Admin)Act. This might occur where a bank account is closed by the individual and new account details have not been provided to Centrelink. In this situation, there may be a variation to the individual's FTB entitlement under section 27A if the individual fails to provide the bank account details within 28 days. The date of effect of the cancellation is the day after the end of the individual's latest entitlement period.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 26A Secretary's power to require bank account details, section 27A Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to provide bank account details

Where the instalment individual subsequently nominates a bank account into which instalments of FTB can be paid, the cancellation must be varied. The date of effect of this variation is the date of cancellation. The variation reinstates the determination that applied before the cancellation.

1.1.G.13 Giving notice (ACCS (child wellbeing))

Definition

The act of an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) notifying an 'appropriate state or territory body' (

1.1.A.75

) that a child in their care is considered 'at risk' (

1.1.A.110

) for the purpose of

ACCS

(child wellbeing).

An approved provider must give notice:

within 6 weeks from an ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate coming into effect

on the date an ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate comes into effect if it was backdated more than 28 days, or

before applying to Centrelink for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination.

The provider does not need to give notice if:

the provider gave an appropriate state or territory body a notice in relation to the child less than 6 weeks prior to giving the certificate or applying for the determination

1.1.T.70 Type of care (CCS)

Definition

For the purposes of

CCS

, the type of care refers to one of the following types of approved child care services (

1.1.A.90

) that a family may use:

centre-based day care (

CBDC

)

family day care (

FDC

)

in home care (

IHC

)

outside school hours care (

OSHC

).

CBDC

CBDC services provide care primarily to children not yet attending school and are open for a minimum of 48 weeks per year.

FDC

FDC is a network of individuals providing child care in their own homes for other people's children, organised and supported by a central coordination unit. FDC is primarily aimed at children not yet attending school, but can also assist school aged children. FDC is a flexible service type providing a range of options.

IHC

IHC is a flexible form of child care where care is provided in the child's home by an approved child care service. IHC is capped at 3,200 child care places nationally. IHC may be available for individuals eligible for CCS who can demonstrate that other types of approved care are not suitable or available, and where one or more of the following criteria apply:

where parents or carers are working non-standard or variable hours, outside normal child care service hours

parents or carers are geographically isolated from other types of approved care, particularly in rural and remote locations

the family has challenging or complex needs, including where families are experiencing challenging situations, and other approved child care services are not able to meet the needs of the child or the family.

OSHC

OSHC services primarily provide care outside normal school hours to children who attend school. The care may be:

before school

after school

on pupil-free days, and

during school holidays (vacation care).

OSHC services are required to be open for a minimum of 7 weeks per year.

4.1.2 Protection of payment

Summary

This topic describes the principle of protection of payment of

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) payments.

Legal basis for protection of payment

The FA(Admin)Act states that the following FA payments are absolutely inalienable, or protected:

family tax benefit

FTB

advances

stillborn baby payment

single income family supplement

one off payment to families

economic security strategy payment to families

back to school bonus or single income family bonus

clean energy advance

education tax refund payment

2020 economic support payment

additional economic support payment 2020

additional economic support payment 2021

child care subsidy

additional child care subsidy

payments under section 67EB (fee reduction amounts), and

payments under section 205A or section 205C (business continuity payments).

An individual's (

1.1.I.90

) right to receive a payment or benefit cannot be transferred to another person (

1.1.P.80

) either by a voluntary act or by the operation of the law.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 66 Protection of payments under this Part, section 67GB Protection of payments in relation to CCS and ACCS, section 67EB Payments to providers of individuals' entitlements to CCS or ACCS by fee reduction, section 67GC Effect of garnishee etc. order, section 205A Business continuity payments-reports not given

Payment to a third party

Under the 'nominee' provisions in the FA(Admin)Act, the Secretary may direct that a payment be made to another party, after considering the wishes of the individual receiving the payment. The individual's consent may not be required.

The Secretary may direct that payments be made to a third party, including Centrepay, but only with the individual's consent.

Maintaining protection of payment

There are 3 circumstances in which, although an individual does not directly receive their payment, they do not transfer their right to that payment because they still benefit from it. Those circumstances are when a payment is:

voluntarily directed by the individual to a third party

withheld by the Commonwealth to repay a debt (

1.1.D.60

) to the Commonwealth or to repay the debt of another person, or

subject to a garnishee order (

1.1.G.10

) on the account to which the payment is made.

These are explained in the rest of this topic.

Individual directing payment to another party

An individual must agree before any payments can be paid to a third party. This is usually done by appointing a nominee (

1.1.N.20

), by using the relevant form.

Example:

An individual may direct their payments to:

a nominee who

exercises power of attorney for all the individual's financial affairs, or

simply operates a bank account on the individual's behalf, into which the individual's payments are made

an institution, or

ACO

through a group payment arrangement.

Commonwealth recovering overpayments or tax

The Commonwealth has the right, and the obligation, to recover:

overpayments, under FA(Admin)Act Part 9

tax liability under

Taxation Administration Act 1953

section 255-5 Recovering a tax‑related liability that is due and payable

child support debt, under FA(Admin)Act section 227 and section 228.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 70 Debts due to the Commonwealth, Part 9-Other matters, section 225 Payment of deductions to Commissioner of Taxation, section 226 Setting off family assistance entitlement against tax liability, section 227 Payment of deductions to Child Support Registrar, section 228 Maximum deduction

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.1.3

Nominees

Garnishee orders

Once a payment has been paid into an individual's bank account it becomes part of the person's funds. A garnishee order on the account, equal to the amount of the individual's payment, is not affected by a person's inalienable rights to payments. The FA(Admin)Act, however, provides for a saved amount to which the garnishee order cannot apply. The saved amount is equal to the following:

the total amount of the individual's payment, including advances, paid into the account in the 4-week period immediately before the order, MINUS

the total amount withdrawn from the account in the same period.

Example:

Simone is receiving an ongoing fortnightly FTB benefit of $164.64. On 20 September a garnishee order comes into force regarding the account. In the previous 4-week period an amount of FTB equalling $329.28 FTB was paid into the account. Simone had withdrawn $160.00 during the 4-week period. The saved amount is $169.28 ($329.28 - $160.00). This amount is exempt from any garnishee conditions.

Example:

Bronwyn is receiving an ongoing fortnightly FTB benefit of $378.70. On 15 November a garnishee order comes into force for the account. In the previous 4-week period an amount of FTB equalling $757.40 FTB was paid into the account. Bronwyn had withdrawn $800.00 from her account during the 4-week period. The saved amount is nil.

4.13.2.20 CCS - relevant arrangement enrolment

Summary

A 'relevant arrangement' refers to an arrangement between a provider and individual, for the care of a child, that does not meet the full requirements for a

CWA

. No

CCS

can be paid for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided under this type of enrolment (

1.1.E.25

), as a result it should only be used where the family is not eligible for CCS or does not wish to claim CCS.

Providers (

1.1.A.90

) are required to submit an enrolment notice if they enter into a relevant arrangement to provide care to a child, although less information is needed than for a CWA enrolment. Relevant arrangement enrolments do not require a parent (

1.1.P.10

) or child

CRN

(as there is no need to link to the individual's eligibility and entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) information), details of routine sessions of care and usual fees, and do not require parent confirmation with Centrelink.

Providers should only establish a relevant arrangement if the individual has stated they do not want their eligibility and entitlement for CCS to be determined for any sessions of care that will be provided under that arrangement.

A relevant arrangement enrolment cannot be changed into a CWA enrolment (or any other type of enrolment). Where a provider and individual have a relevant arrangement in place and later need to create a CWA (for example, because the family now wishes to claim CCS), the provider must create a new CWA enrolment.

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, interim reconciliation is the process whereby a separated individual's estimated

ATI

and maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

) is reconciled against their actual ATI (

1.1.A.20

) and actual maintenance income before the actual ATI and actual maintenance income of their ex-partner is available.

This process may be undertaken where an individual separated from a partner during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

).

Note:

Centrelink may also use the term 'interim reconciliation' to describe a situation where an individual's

FTB

entitlement is reconciled pending actual ATI information for their partner.

1.1.S.110 Start date of permanent legal residence (CCS)

Usage

This term applies to people who:

have been granted a visa allowing them to reside permanently in Australia (

1.1.A.120

), and

are permanent residents of Australia.

The term does not apply to New Zealand citizens as they enter Australia on an

SCV

that does not necessarily mean that they are permanent residents of Australia.

Definition

The start date of permanent legal residence is the date when permanent residence was granted, or the person arrived in Australia, whichever is the later.

Explanation:

If a person is granted a permanent visa before arriving in Australia, the start date of permanent legal residence is the date they arrived in Australia. Alternatively, if a person comes to Australia as a temporary resident and later applies for permanent residence, the start date of permanent legal residence is the date on which permanent residence is granted.

1.1.P.100 Prescribed educational scheme

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, 'prescribed educational scheme' has the same meaning as under the

SSAct

, and consists of payments under the following schemes:

the means tested components of the

ABSTUDY

scheme including:

living allowance

the additional amount of Group 2 school fees allowance that is subject to the parental income test

a student financial supplement scheme (closed to new entrants since 31 December 2003)

the Veterans' Children Education Scheme

the scheme to provide education and training under

Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004

section 258, and

the Post-Graduate Awards Scheme.

Interaction with ABSTUDY

The means tested components of the ABSTUDY scheme are not considered payments under a prescribed educational scheme for the purposes of determining whether a child 16 years or over is an

FTB

child if the payments are being paid on the basis that the child:

is undertaking full-time study at a secondary school

is a student approved to live away from home (under the ABSTUDY scheme), and

is boarding away from home for the purposes of attending school.

This means that an ABSTUDY child aged 16 years or over would continue to be regarded as an FTB child if they are receiving ABSTUDY to attend boarding school or a student hostel.

) for the relevant income year and confirm income.

Individuals and/or their partners who are required to lodge an income tax return must do so within 12 months of the end of the relevant income year (lodgement period). The same timeframe applies for individuals to notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

If an individual who receives

FTB

and/or their partner fail to lodge an income tax return by the end of the lodgement year or fail to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, a debt will be raised against them. The debt may be comprised of all the FTB they received for the relevant income year. Any

SBP

paid (where paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test) will also be raised as a debt. Additionally, if the individual subsequently lodges an income tax return, or notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, after the lodgement period, supplements and top-ups may not be paid.

Individuals who intend to lodge a past period claim for an income year must do so within 12 months of the end of that income year. These individuals, and/or their partners, must lodge an income tax return if required, or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months of the end of the relevant income year (lodgement period). If lump sum claimants fail to meet these timeframes, their lump sum claim will be deemed ineffective.

5.1.3.20 Exchanging information within Centrelink

Exchanging information

The Commonwealth has the power to obtain information about a person (

1.1.P.80

) or a group of persons for the purposes of verifying information provided to Centrelink. It may be necessary for information about a person to be exchanged between government agencies for the purposes of administering

FA

law.

Example:

If an FA recipient (

1.1.R.07

) moves to another state or territory of Australia (

1.1.A.120

), information about their personal circumstances may need to be transferred to the Centrelink office nearest to their new location.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 154 General power to obtain information, section 156 Obtaining information about a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth, section 157 Obtaining information to verify claims etc., section 157A Obtaining records supporting certificate under section 85CB

Protection from use of conflicting information

Situations may occur where the information provided by a person on an application may conflict with information about that person held for FA purposes.

Example:

1.1.I.90

) may state on an application that they were 'living together' with the named parent (

1.1.P.10

) of their

FTB

child for a particular period, when they had previously advised that they were single during that period. This 'new' information may not be used for reviewing the individual's social security entitlements (

1.1.S.70

).

Unauthorised access & use of information

1.1.M.15 Maintenance agreement (FTB)

Introduction

This topic only relates to agreements made prior to 1 July 2008. Information relating to agreements made under the Child Support Scheme Reforms, and commencing on or after 1 July 2008 can be found in

3.1.7.14

.

Summary

The following terms are all related to maintenance agreements.

Definition: maintenance agreement

For the purposes of

FTB

, a 'maintenance agreement' means a written agreement, made within or outside Australia (

1.1.A.120

) that provides for the maintenance of an individual whether or not it also makes provision in relation to other matters including dependent children.

Note:

This definition now generally only covers spousal maintenance. If the maintenance is for a child, and the individual could make a child support application then this agreement has effect only to the extent that it is also a child support agreement.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'maintenance agreement'

Definition: registered agreement

For the purposes of FTB, a 'registered agreement' means a maintenance agreement that has been approved by the Family Court of Australia as meeting the requirements of the

Family Law Act 1975

, and as such is deemed as being registered in that court.

Act reference:

Family Law Act 1975

section 86 Registered maintenance agreements

Definition: child support agreement

For the purposes of FTB, a 'child support agreement' is a formal document registered with Child Support outlining agreed terms of child support (

1.1.C.20

) payable for the child/children. The document may relate to both the amounts payable and the period for which the agreement applies. A child support agreement can only be made between individuals, and in relation to children, who are considered eligible under the

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

.

A child support agreement only applies to Stage 2 individuals and should not be confused with:

Stage 1 court registered maintenance agreements, or

private collection arrangements (

1.1.P.130

).

Payment arrangements for a child support agreement can be made by:

private arrangement, or

Child Support collection, or

a combination of both.

The payee may choose whether to have Child Support collect the cash component of the child support.

7.1.4 FA debts - interest charge on debts

Summary

An interest charge can be applied to outstanding social security,

FA

(

1.1.F.02

), student assistance,

PPL

payment debts of individuals (

1.1.I.90

) or

CCS

and

ACCS

debts (

1.1.D.60

) of approved providers (

1.1.A.90

) who have failed to enter into, or have not complied with, an acceptable payment arrangement.

An interest charge will be applied to an individual or approved provider debt from the day after the debt is due and payable, that is, on the 29th day after the date of the debt notice, where the outstanding debt has not been paid in full or the individual or approved provider has not entered into or is not complying with, a payment arrangement.

Exemptions apply where an individual remains in receipt of

FTB

by instalments or a social security payment. Debts for these individuals are recovered through deductions from their ongoing payments.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

7.1.1

FA debts - general provisions,

7.2.2

Debt recovery by deduction

Exemption from interest charge

The following individuals are exempt from the interest charge:

an individual receiving a social security payment

an individual receiving instalments of FTB at a rate above nil

an individual receiving a veterans' pension or allowance

an individual receiving

ABSTUDY

instalments that includes living allowance

an individual receiving instalments under the

AIC

Scheme.

Exemptions are not available for those individuals with outstanding debts who only receive child care assistance and/or payments under the PPLAct. This is because automatic deductions are not able to be made from these payments to repay existing debts.

Individuals on a nil rate of payment (for example, families who defer their FTB payments) are not automatically exempt from the interest charge.

Centrelink has the discretion to determine that an interest charge is not payable in special circumstances. This may include (but is not limited to) where Centrelink is satisfied the individual has a reasonable excuse for failing to enter into, or for failing to make a payment under, a payment arrangement.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 78D Exemption from interest charge—general, section 78E Exemption from interest charge-Secretary's determination

Payment arrangements

An interest charge will not be applied to a debt where an individual or approved provider has, within 28 days of the date on the debt notice:

paid the debt in full

continued to make payments under an existing payment arrangement (where one is in place), or

entered into an acceptable payment arrangement, made a payment under that arrangement and is continuing to comply with the arrangement.

For individuals, the rate of the repayment instalment will be negotiated with Centrelink, and will be determined by the size of the debt and the time it would take to repay the debt as quickly as possible without causing severe financial hardship.

For approved providers, the rate of the repayment instalment will need to be negotiated with the Department of Education.

A debt may be written off for a specified period of time where recovery would result in an individual being in severe financial hardship. The test for severe financial hardship is based on individual circumstances. The interest charge would not be applied during the period of the write-off.

Failure to comply with a payment arrangement

Where an individual or approved provider has entered into a payment arrangement and fails to make a scheduled payment under that arrangement, the interest charge will be applied to the debt until:

the debt is paid in full (including any interest charged)

any outstanding amounts due under the arrangement have been paid, or

the arrangement is terminated by the appropriate department.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 78A Interest charge—failure to comply with or termination of repayment arrangement

Termination of the payment arrangement

A payment arrangement for an individual may be terminated by Centrelink, or an approved provider by the Department of Education:

at the debtor's request

after giving 28 days' notice to the debtor of the proposed termination, or

without notice, if the relevant department is satisfied that the debtor has failed to disclose material information about their true capacity to repay the debt.

Where a payment arrangement is terminated, to avoid the interest charge being applied to a debtor's debt/s, they will have 14 days to either repay the debt and any interest charged, or enter into an acceptable payment arrangement, make a payment under that arrangement and continue to comply with the arrangement.

Centrelink has discretion not to terminate an arrangement at the request of an individual if Centrelink considers this appropriate.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 91 Arrangement for payment of debt by instalments, section 78A Interest charge—failure to comply with or termination of repayment arrangement

Calculation of an interest charge

The rate of the interest charge is the 90-day Bank Accepted Bill rate published by the Reserve Bank of Australia (

Interest Rates and Yields - Money Market - Monthly - F1.1

), plus an additional 7%, as is applied by the

ATO

for tax debts (

General interest charge (GIC) rates

). The interest charge will be updated quarterly.

The interest charge is compounded on a daily basis and is applied to the debt monthly, during the period that the debt remains unpaid or until an acceptable payment arrangement is entered into, a payment is made under that arrangement and the arrangement continues to be complied with.

2.8.4.70 ACCS (transition to work) - time limits

Summary

This topic describes the time limits that apply to

ACCS

(transition to work).

This topic includes:

periods of ACCS (transition to work)

summary of limits on periods of ACCS (transition to work)

start date

change of start date

in receipt of another kind of ACCS

exceeding allowable absences (

1.1.A.05

), and

time limits for

study

job search

work

training and other programs.

Periods of ACCS (transition to work)

ACCS (transition to work) is applied for a continuous period of whole weeks and time limits will apply for the period specified, even if a session of care (

1.1.S.40

) did not take place for a particular week during that period.

Summary of limits on periods of ACCS (transition to work)

ACCS (transition to work) can only be approved for a period of time up to the activity time limits for the activity requirement being met. The time limits per activity is summarised in the table below. More detail is provided in subsequent sections.

If an individual is …

they can receive ACCS (transition to work) for …

working (paid or unpaid) or setting up a business

up to 26 weeks.

studying a secondary course

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

studying a preparatory course

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

studying a Certificate II to an advanced diploma

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study

for each level of the AQF.

studying a bachelor degree

up to 156 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 312 weeks for part-time study.

studying a bachelor honours degree to graduate diploma

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

vocational training

up to 52 weeks for full-time or

up to 104 weeks part-time.

program improving employment prospects

up to 52 weeks full-time.

participating in a job search activity

up to 26 weeks.

no longer in receipt of an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) (in a nil rate period) due to employment

up to 12 weeks.

Start date

The earliest start date for a period of ACCS (transition to work) is from the date of application. The start date must be the first Monday of a

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

), and the period of ACCS (transition to work) must be whole weeks. ACCS (transition to work) cannot be backdated beyond the date of application.

An application for ACCS (transition to work) can be made prior to commencement of an activity with a future start date. As there are no backdating provisions, an individual (

1.1.I.90

) may prefer to apply prior to commencement of their activity. Time limits on future start dates have not been prescribed, but are limited by evidentiary requirements. For study activities, evidence is to be dated within 6 months of the date of application. For other activities the validity of the evidence would determine the timeframe. For some job search and some work activities, such as setting up a business, the individual may have to commence the activity to be able to provide evidence of their participation.

It is also important to note that entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) for ACCS (transition to work) is determined at the start of each CCS fortnight, meaning that if an individual does not meet any of the eligibility criteria for ACCS (transition to work) on that Monday, they are ineligible for ACCS (transition to work) and will have to reapply. This includes being in receipt of an income support payment, having a Job Plan (

1.1.J.20

) in effect if required as a condition of their income support payment and meeting the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements. It also means that if an individual becomes ineligible during a CCS fortnight and is eligible again before the start of the next CCS fortnight, entitlement to ACCS (transition to work) will continue.

For example, if an individual's required Job Plan becomes inactive after the Monday of a CCS fortnight, and a new Job Plan is entered into before the start of the next CCS fortnight, entitlement to ACCS (transition to work) will continue. If an individual's required Job Plan becomes inactive after the Monday of a CCS fortnight, and a new Job Plan is not entered into before the start of the next CCS fortnight, the individual will become ineligible for ACCS (transition to work) and will have to reapply.

Activities that commence during a week are taken to have commenced from the start of that week; as an example, if a term starts on a Monday, but the individual attends classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, they will be taken to have commenced the activity on the Monday of the week their first Tuesday class occurs. Similarly, if an individual starts a new job, and their first shift is on a Wednesday, they will be taken to have started their job from the Monday of that week. This means they may be entitled to ACCS (transition to work) from the start of that week if that Monday is the start of a CCS fortnight, or from the Monday of the next week at the start of the next CCS fortnight.

Change of start date

If an individual needs to change their ACCS (transition to work) start date it may be amended to the first Monday of a future CCS fortnight. This can only be allowed due to a change of circumstances and only if no sessions of care have occurred and no payments have been made.

In receipt of another kind of ACCS

If an individual's circumstances change, and they are eligible for another kind of ACCS, they will no longer be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) and the period during which they are receiving the other subsidy will not be included in the calculation of ACCS (transition to work) time limits. If they want to continue to receive ACCS (transition to work) they will need to reapply.

Example:

Laura is approved for ACCS (transition to work) for a period of 26 weeks. After 12 weeks, Laura experiences a financial hardship event and is granted ACCS (temporary financial hardship) for a period of 13 weeks. Laura would receive ACCS (transition to work) for 12 weeks, ACCS (temporary financial hardship) for 13 weeks, and then Laura could reapply for ACCS (transition to work) for the remaining 14 weeks of her (transition to work) entitlement.

Exceeding allowable absences

To be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) for a session of care, an individual must be eligible for CCS for that same session of care. As such, if an individual ceases to be eligible for CCS for a session of care due to exceeding allowable absences (or any other reason) they will not be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) for that session of care.

Time limits - study

For activities that relate to study requirements the time period relates to the level of each new course of education or study that the individual studies:

studying a secondary course, such as year 12 or similar

studying a preparatory course (to prepare for tertiary study)

studying a Certificate II to an advanced diploma or associate degree (level 2 to 6 of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF))

studying a bachelor degree

studying a bachelor honours degree, graduate certificate, graduate diploma (level 8 of the AQF).

The following time limits apply for study activities for ACCS (transition to work):

If an individual is …

they can receive ACCS (transition to work) for …

studying a secondary course

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

studying a preparatory course

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

studying a Certificate II to an advanced diploma

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study

for each level of the AQF.

studying a bachelor degree

up to 156 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 312 weeks for part-time study.

studying a bachelor honours degree to graduate diploma

up to 104 weeks for full-time study, or

up to 208 weeks for part-time study.

If an individual received assistance under the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance (JETCCFA) program within the last 10 years (was in receipt of JETCCFA from 2 July 2008), the time limit for ACCS (transition to work) will be reduced by the time period the individual has received JETCCFA to study at that level.

Example:

Melanie studied but did not complete a diploma course in 2010. To be eligible for ACCS (transition to work), Melanie is required to study at the diploma level or above. As Melanie received JETCCFA assistance to study at the diploma level for 26 weeks in 2010, her ACCS (transition to work) allowable time period to study at the diploma level of 104 weeks will be reduced by the 26 weeks Melanie has already received JETCCFA assistance. This leaves Melanie with an available balance of 78 weeks of ACCS (transition to work) to study at the diploma level.

Study breaks

Time limits for study are applied in a period of continuous weeks, and include study breaks that are during but not after the end of the course.

Example:

Peter is studying a 2-year course with mid-year and end of year semester breaks. He will be taken to be participating in a study activity from the start of the course through until the end of the course, including the mid-year semester breaks and the first end of year semester break.

Changes in study load

An individual in receipt of ACCS (transition to work) is able to change their study load for their study activity.

Calculating changes in study load

The method for calculating changes in study load will be used to work out how many weeks of ACCS (transition to work) entitlement remain when an individual transitions from full-time study to part-time study (or vice versa).

As the part-time study quota (208 weeks for AQF Levels 2 to 6) is double the quota of full-time study (104 weeks for AQF Levels 2 to 6) the following formula applies:

Transitioning from full time to part time study

Number of weeks already used × 2 = A

208 weeks - A = remaining (converted) eligibility period

Transitioning from part time to full time study

Number of weeks already used ÷ 2 = A

104 weeks - A = remaining (converted) eligibility period

Example:

Leah has used 50 weeks of full-time study for transition to work but will commence studying on a part-time basis at the beginning of next term. When Leah's new study load is updated, her ACCS (transition to work) eligibility period will be converted to show that she has used 100 weeks (50 x 2) of her part-time study allocation, and that there are 108 weeks of part-time study allocation remaining.

Example:

Luke has used 186 weeks of part-time study for ACCS (transition to work) but will commence studying on a full-time basis at the beginning of next term. When Luke's new study load is updated, his ACCS (transition to work) eligibility period will be converted to show that he has used 93 weeks (186 ÷ 2) of his full-time study allocation, and that there are 11 weeks of full-time study allocation remaining.

Time limits - job search

The time limits for job search activities for ACCS (transition to work) are as follows:

If an individual is …

they can receive ACCS (transition to work) for …

participating in a job search activity

up to 26 weeks.

Time limits - job search activity limits

The time limit of 26 weeks for job search activities is a cumulative limit over an individual's lifetime. This means that a job search activity can be undertaken for 26 consecutive weeks, or a number of job search activities for a shorter time period can be undertaken until a total of 26 weeks is reached. Once the time limit of 26 weeks is reached that individual cannot apply for another job search activity under ACCS (transition to work).

Example:

Scott applies for ACCS (transition to work) for a job search activity, and receives ACCS (transition to work) for 4 weeks until he takes a summer job for 12 weeks. Scott then applies for ACCS (transition to work) for a job search activity for another 6 weeks. At that stage, Scott has used 10 weeks of job search under ACCS (transition to work) and can access another 16 weeks in the future if needed.

Time limits - work

The time limits for work activities for ACCS (transition to work) are as follows:

If an individual is …

they can receive ACCS (transition to work) for …

working (paid or unpaid) or setting up a business

up to 26 weeks.

Time limits - work activity limits

The time limit of 26 weeks for work related activities is a cumulative limit over an individual's lifetime. This means that a work related activity can be undertaken for 26 consecutive weeks, or a number of work related activities for a shorter time period can be undertaken until a total of 26 weeks is reached. Once the time limit of 26 weeks is reached, that individual cannot apply for another work related activity under ACCS (transition to work).

For a paid work activity, if an individual's child/ren will be attending child care on a trial basis, up to 2 weeks of the time limit for a work activity may be used immediately before the activity start date to support the children into child care.

Time limits - training & other programs

The time limits for training activities for ACCS (transition to work) are as follows:

If an individual is …

they can receive ACCS (transition to work) for …

vocational training

up to 52 weeks for full-time, or

up to 104 weeks part-time.

program improving employment prospects

up to 52 weeks full-time.

Time limits - training activity limits

The time limit of 52 weeks (104 weeks' part-time) for vocational training activities, and 52 weeks for other programs that improve employment prospects, is a cumulative limit over an individual's lifetime. This means that a training activity can be undertaken for 52 consecutive weeks, or a number of training activities for a shorter time period can be undertaken until a total of 52 weeks is reached. Once the time limit of 52 weeks is reached for a vocational training activity, and the time limit of 52 weeks is reached for other programs the individual cannot apply for a further training activity under ACCS (transition to work).

Example:

Belinda does a 6-week vocational training course; she will have used 6 weeks of the available 52 weeks for a vocational training activity. She will have a balance of 46 weeks to use for further vocational training activities. Once she has used the balance of 46 weeks, she will be unable to access any further ACCS (transition to work) for a vocational training activity.

Where an activity may be training or study

In some cases, vocational training courses meet the AQF level requirements. In this case the activity could be assessed as a study activity instead of a training activity (

2.8.4.80

).

2.2.3 NBS & NBU eligibility for individuals

Summary

This topic describes the following:

eligibility for

NBU

eligibility for

NBS

exceptions

avoiding duplicate payments, and

birth registration.

Eligibility for NBU

If an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is eligible for at least one day of NBS and is not excluded under the legislative instrument (see '

Avoiding duplicate payments'

below), NBU is also paid. An individual is not eligible for NBU for a child if they or their partner have previously received NBU in relation to that child.

Eligibility for NBS

An individual may be eligible for NBS for a day where the individual meets

FTB

eligibility criteria (

2.2.1

) for an FTB child (

2.1.1.10

) born or entrusted to care as part of an adoption process and meets the conditions under one of the following 3 categories:

Category

Detail

1. Parent of child

An individual may be eligible for NBS under this category if:

the individual or their partner is a parent of the child

the child is aged less than one on that day

with NBS included, the individual's FTB Part A rate (disregarding any reductions for FTB advances (

1.2.8

) and any election to receive

ES

quarterly (

1.2.10

)) would be greater than nil on that day

that day occurs in the period of 13 weeks beginning on the day that the conditions above are satisfied, and

the birth registration requirement is met (see below).

2. Child entrusted to care of an individual or their partner

An individual may be eligible for NBS under this category if:

neither the individual nor their partner is a parent of the child

on or before that day, the child became entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner

the child is aged less than one on that day

with NBS included, the individual's FTB Part A rate (disregarding any reductions for FTB advances (

1.2.8

) and any election to receive ES quarterly (

1.2.10

)) would be greater than nil on that day, and

that day occurs in the period of 13 weeks beginning on the day that the conditions above are satisfied.

However, an individual is not eligible for NBS under this category if the child is not an FTB child of the individual for a continuous period of 13 weeks beginning on the first day that the first 4 criteria above are satisfied.

3. Adoption

An individual may be eligible for NBS under this category if:

on or before that day, the child became entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner

it is an authorised party (

1.1.A.135

) that entrusts the child to the care of the individual or their partner

the authorised party does so as part of the process for the adoption of the child by the individual or their partner

with NBS included, the individual's FTB Part A rate (disregarding any reductions for FTB advances (

1.2.8

) and any election to receive ES quarterly (

1.2.10

)) would be greater than nil on that day

that day occurs in the period of 13 weeks beginning on the day that the conditions above are satisfied, and

that day occurs before the end of the period of 12 months beginning on the day the child became entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner.

Exceptions

If an individual is a member of a couple and their partner is eligible for

PLP

for a child, the individual is not eligible for NBS or NBU for that child. If an individual’s former partner is eligible for PLP for a child for a day in which they were a member of a couple, the individual is not eligible for NBS or NBU for that child.

If an amount of NBS is added in relation to an individual and an FTB child of the individual for a period of 13 weeks and the individual is a member of a couple for that entire 13-week period, then the individual's partner is not eligible for NBS for that child.

An individual is not eligible for NBS for a day in the circumstances prescribed under the relevant legislative instrument -

A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement - Entitlement Exclusion) Determination 2024.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 35A Eligibility for NBS

Avoiding duplicate payments

An individual cannot receive a duplicate benefit of NBS or NBU for the same child.

In considering whether or not NBS should be paid for a child, it should be taken into account whether an individual has benefited, either directly or indirectly, from an NBS or NBU payment received by another individual for that child.

Potentially, duplication payments could occur where NBS or NBU has been paid to the partner or former partner of the individual or the former partner of the individual's current partner.

If no exclusion rules apply, the individual is eligible for payment until the end of their NBS period (

1.1.N.10

).

Example:

Sophie has received 50 days of NBS for her daughter Amelia. On 1 January 2018, Sophie reunites with Amelia's father Ben and Ben claims FTB for Amelia.

On 1 March 2018, Sophie and Ben separate.

Ben's eligibility for NBS is assessed to ensure that Sophie does not receive a duplicate benefit of NBS while they are members of the same couple. The assessment recognises that Sophie has not received the full benefit of the maximum 13 weeks (91 days) NBS period.

For the period that Ben and Sophie are members of a couple (day one to day 59 of Ben's NBS period), Ben is eligible for NBS for the following number of days (Rule 2 applies):

91 − the number of days Sophie was eligible for NBS while they were a couple = 91 − 50 = 41 days

Therefore, while Ben is a member of a couple with Sophie, he can receive the NBS for 41 days. NBS is not added to Ben's rate of FTB Part A from day 42 to day 59 of Ben's NBS period. This ensures that Sophie does not receive (through payment to Ben) more than 13 weeks (91 days) of NBS.

For the period that Ben and Sophie are not members of the same couple (day 60 to day 91 of Ben's NBS period), no exclusions apply to Ben and NBS is added to Ben's FTB Part A rate for the rest of his NBS period. Ben is also eligible for NBU on day 60 as he is no longer a member of a couple with Sophie and he was not a member of a couple with Sophie during her NBS period.

Example:

Emily receives NBS and NBU with her FTB for her son Noah. Before the end of her NBS period, Emily partners with Noah's father Chris.

Emily and Chris later separate and both have shared care of Noah. Chris claims FTB for Noah and his eligibility for NBS and NBU is assessed. As Chris was partnered with Emily during her NBS period he is not entitled to receive NBU and his NBS period is reduced by the number of days he was a member of a couple with Emily during her NBS period.

1.1.N.10

NBS period

Birth registration

Where an individual or their partner is a parent of the child and are responsible for registering the birth of the child in accordance with a relevant state or territory law, the NBS birth registration requirement must also be met. To meet the birth registration requirement, the individual or their partner must have either registered the birth of the child, or applied to register the birth of their child. In addition, the Secretary must be notified, or become aware, that this requirement has been met by the end of the first income year following the income year (the relevant year) in which the last day of the NBS period falls, or if the Secretary has granted an extension on the time period for lodging an FTB claim under FA(Admin)Act paragraph 10(2)(b) due to special circumstances and that claim is for a period falling within the relevant year, by the end of the period that the Secretary has allowed.

1.1.C.50 Compensation

Definition

Compensation is a payment that is made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn, whether paid as a lump sum or periodic payments, either within or outside Australia (

1.1.A.120

).

Compensation is not identified separately by the

FA

income test. Any taxable component of a compensation amount is included in the individual's (

1.1.I.90

) taxable income (

1.1.T.20

) and is therefore assessable for FA purposes. Non-taxable compensation is not assessed under the FA income test.

4.2.4.20 Claim action 2 - claim not complete

Is a letter required?

No.

What to do

Centrelink must contact the applicant (

1.1.A.72

) to obtain any outstanding information or documents. Outstanding information can be obtained:

over the phone

by signing a written statement, or

in person.

Where outstanding information is obtained over the phone or in person, an electronic or written record of the following information must be made:

the details obtained

the details of the officer who obtained the information

the date the information was obtained, and

the method used to obtain the information.

Outstanding documents can be obtained by:

mail, or

in-person.

Time given to comply with the request

The applicant has 14 days from the date of the initial request to comply with the request to provide outstanding information. Applicants may request an extension of time to provide information, up to a maximum of 13 weeks, which Centrelink may grant if it is reasonable to do so. The request must be made within the 14-day period. The extension may be renewed subject to the 13-week maximum.

Some of the circumstances in which it may be reasonable to grant an extension include:

an applicant having practical difficulties in meeting the 14-day timeframe as a result of living in a remote area or overseas

an emergency interfering with an applicant's plans to lodge within the 14-day period, or

documentation not immediately available.

Consequences of not complying with the request

Failure of the applicant to provide the requested information or documents stops the claim from being effective (

1.1.E.10

).

The applicant should be advised that an ineffective claim cannot be reinstated by any Centrelink action, and if they want to test their eligibility for

FTB

in the future they must lodge a new claim.

Record-keeping

An electronic or paper file record of this advice should be kept.

4.1.3.20 Correspondence nominees

Mail directed to a third person

A 'correspondence nominee' is a person appointed by the Secretary to receive mail from Centrelink on behalf of an individual. A correspondence nominee assists the individual in their dealings with Centrelink, including fulfilling reporting obligations.

Centrelink should consider the circumstances and wishes of the individual to ensure that the proposed correspondence nominee arrangement is the most appropriate arrangement for the individual.

To appoint a nominee, the individual should complete the relevant Centrelink form. The nominee is required to indicate their acceptance of the appointment and their duties under

FA

law via written consent. Centrelink must send letters confirming the appointment to both the individual and the nominee.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 219TD Provisions relating to appointments

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.1.3.30

Responsibilities of nominees

The wishes of the individual

Centrelink must take into consideration the wishes (if any) of the individual, which may include the consent of the individual, before appointing a person as the individual’s correspondence nominee. Although the individual’s consent is not strictly required, whenever there is any question of the individual's capability to express their wishes or consent to the appointment of a nominee, or any concerns as to an existing arrangement, Centrelink must investigate the situation further. Where the individual is deemed incapable of expressing their wishes or providing consent, Centrelink must obtain documentary evidence to support any decision to appoint a nominee.

There may be times where an individual is not capable, for example due to an intellectual/physical constraint, of expressing their wishes or providing consent to the appointment of a nominee. In these cases, Centrelink may appoint a nominee on behalf of the individual with attention to supporting evidence and where Centrelink is fully satisfied that the nominee is required and will act in the individual's best interests. The decision made by Centrelink to appoint a nominee in these circumstances must be fully documented.

Where an individual has a psychiatric disability, a nominee can be appointed where there is a court-appointed arrangement such as a Guardianship Order provided by a Mental Health Tribunal.

Evidence of individual's incapability

To decide whether an individual is incapable of expressing their wishes in relation to the appointment of a nominee, Centrelink must have sufficient evidence.

Examples

of what may contribute to evidence may be:

reliable medical evidence on file

recent certification by a medical practitioner

reliable documentation or order officially appointing a guardian or administrator, such as a Public Trustee or Guardianship Board, or

some other authoritative source, such as a social work report.

Other arrangements

There are some instances where the appointment of a nominee may not be the most appropriate option to meet the best interests of the individual.

When responding to a third party requesting information regarding the individual's payments, it may be more appropriate to consider the release of information under implied consent arrangements rather than by appointing a nominee.

Example:

An individual is in a coma and someone needs to make contact to obtain information about their payment details on their behalf. A hospital social worker calls Centrelink in an attempt to obtain the information. It may be appropriate in this case for a Centrelink worker to disclose the individual's payment details to the hospital worker.

2.3.1 When an ACO is eligible for FTB for a child

Summary

This section explains eligibility for

FTB

for

ACO

s (

1.1.A.80

) and covers the following:

general eligibility criteria

ACO eligibility and other types of payment

ACOs and other FTB eligible individuals

an individual providing care for a child in an ACO, and

ACO co-ordinates residential services.

An ACO is paid a flat rate of FTB.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.2

FTB rate for ACOs

General eligibility criteria

An ACO is eligible for FTB for a child if:

the child is

aged under 16 years, or

aged 16 to 19 years (up to the end of the calendar year in which they turn 19) and a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

)

the child is a client of the organisation, and

the child is an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

).

Act reference:

FAAct

section 34 When an approved care organisation is eligible for FTB

ACO eligibility & other types of payment

The ACO is not eligible for FTB if the child, or someone else on their behalf, is receiving one of the following payments:

a social security pension (

1.1.S.90

) or benefit (

1.1.S.60

)

a labour market program (

1.1.L.10

) payment, or

where the child is aged 16 or more, a prescribed educational scheme payment (

1.1.P.100

), aside from

ABSTUDY

boarding payments.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 35 When an approved care organisation is not eligible for FTB

ACOs & other FTB eligible individuals

An ACO is not eligible for FTB for a child if anyone else is eligible for FTB for the child. If an individual becomes eligible for FTB for a child who was cared for by an ACO, the ACO loses eligibility. FTB cannot be shared between an individual and an ACO.

Example:

An ACO arranges long-term foster care with carer families. In these circumstances the foster carer is eligible for FTB, not the ACO, as the foster carer has legal responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the child.

Individual providing care for a child in an ACO

If an individual is providing care for a child who is living in an ACO, it is possible for the individual to retain eligibility for FTB. In this case, the ACO cannot be eligible for FTB for the child.

Factors that should be considered when deciding whether the child is an FTB child of an individual even though the child is a client of an ACO include:

Is the individual still responsible for the welfare and development of the child?

Example:

The child receives their education in a boarding school.

Does the individual provide financial support for the child?

Example:

The individual pays fees to the ACO.

Does the individual have regular contact with the child?

Example:

The individual visits regularly on weekends, takes the child on day trips, or has the child overnight at home.

Does the individual provide for the health and physical well-being of the child?

Example:

The individual is consulted when the child needs medical attention and pays for any medical costs.

Is the individual the first contact in case of an emergency?

Is there a definite date or intention for the child to return to live with the individual?

All factors should be considered when deciding if the child is a dependant of the individual or the ACO.

Example:

Tony advises Centrelink that their child Susan has started to live in an ACO on a long-term basis. Tony provides financial and emotional support for Susan and is involved in making the day-to-day decisions about Susan's care. Susan is still an FTB child of Tony. The private financial arrangement Tony has made with the ACO for Susan's costs may or may not be equivalent to the amount of FTB Tony receives.

ACO co-ordinates residential services

An ACO that co-ordinates but does not provide residential services to young people is still eligible for FTB. The young people in these circumstances are treated as clients of the ACO.

8.2 ES - grandfathering provisions

Introduction

ES

ceased on 20 March 2017 and is not paid for new

FTB

recipients who commence payment on or after this date. However, grandfathering rules permit an individual or

ACO

with entitlement to an FTB legislative rate on 19 September 2016 to continue to receive ES in circumstances as described below.

Grandfathering & FTB fortnightly payments

An individual or ACO with entitlement to a rate of FTB on 19 September 2016 will continue to receive ES with their payment provided there is no break in their entitlement for the payment.

Example:

Ted and Polly's youngest child Harry finishes year 12 in November 2016. As a result their FTB Part A payments are cancelled from 1 January 2017. In April 2017, they become carers of their 14 year old niece Jemima, and lodge a claim for FTB Part A. As there was a break in their FTB entitlement after 20 September 2016, ES is not included as part of the FTB payments going forward.

Grandfathering pathways for FTB

A person who moves between FTB Part A and FTB Part B (the pathway) on or after the 20 September 2016, without a break in their FTB entitlement, will continue to be eligible for a rate of ES which applies to that payment.

Example:

Thelma receives both FTB Part A and Part B by fortnightly instalments for her 7 year old son Brad. On 3 April 2017, Thelma notified Centrelink that she has a new partner and loses eligibility to FTB Part B, however, due to their combined income she continues to receive FTB Part A. As there is no break in entitlement to FTB Part A, she continues to receive the ES with her FTB Part A.

An individual who loses entitlement to FTB on or after 20 September 2016, will no longer be eligible for ES, even if they later again become eligible for FTB payments.

Example:

George and Mildred receive FTB Part A by fortnightly instalments for their child Jim during 2015-16. They contact Centrelink in May 2016 and provide an income estimate for the 2016-17 year which is over the threshold to receive FTB Part A by fortnightly instalments, resulting in them then not being eligible for FTB Part A by fortnightly instalments. When reconciliation of their 2015-16 FTB payments is finalised, it is found they were not eligible for FTB Part A payments due to their combined ATI. Mildred loses her job in July 2017 and lodges a new claim for FTB. The claim for FTB is granted, however ES is not included in their rate of FTB as they did not have continuous payment or entitlement to payment since 19 September 2016.

ES is not grandfathered from an income support payment to FTB or FTB to an income support payment.

Grandfathering for past period claims

Where a person lodges a past period claim for the 2016-17 income year (known as a lump sum claim) and the claim is granted; that person will be eligible for ES grandfathering if it is determined that they have an FTB legislative rate greater than nil in respect of 19 September 2016. That person's ES will be maintained for subsequent instalment and lump sum claim periods provided there is no break in FTB entitlement.

Example:

Kath and Kim have 4 children under 12 and lodge a past period claim for FTB Part A for the 2016-17 income year on 10 August 2017. It is determined that they were entitled to FTB Part A for each day during income year which includes 19 September 2016, therefore they are entitled for ES to be included as part of the FTB Part A lump sum amount.

Note:

If it was determined that Kath and Kim were not entitled to FTB Part A for one day or more after the 19 September 2016, they would no longer be eligible for ES in any future past period claim for FTB Part A.

Recipients from 20 September 2016 to 19 March 2017

ES will no longer be paid after 19 March 2017 to individuals who became new recipients of FTB after 20 September 2016.

Example:

Rita lodges a claim for FTB to be paid in fortnightly instalments on 1 December 2016 following the birth of her first child, Emily, on 5 November 2016. Her claim for FTB is granted and when her fortnightly FTB instalments commence, ES is also paid as she was a new recipient after 20 September 2016. However, after 20 March 2017, ES ceases to be paid with Rita's fortnightly instalments.

Debt recovery by garnishee

No time limit on debt recovery

As of 1 January 2017, any action to recover an FA debt can be commenced at any time. The former 6 year statute of limitations no longer applies.

If a debt that was deemed irrecoverable at law prior to 1 January 2017 because the relevant time limit has expired for the recovery of the debt, it cannot be pursued, however, Centrelink can still accept voluntary repayments of the debt.

Even when a debt was deemed irrecoverable at law due to the former statute of limitations, the debt still exists. The debt may be waived where appropriate.

Example:

An FTB debt was identified in relation to an individual on 1 January 2005. By 1 January 2011, no action had been taken to recover the debt. As the relevant time limit has expired for the recovery of the debt (6 years) prior to 1 January 2017, the debt cannot be pursued.

Example:

An FTB debt was identified in relation to an individual on 1 January 2015. By 1 January 2017, no recovery action had been taken. As the relevant time limit (6 years) has not expired by 1 January 2017, the debt remains recoverable. No further time limits will apply to its recovery.

4.4.10 Security notice issued

Summary

This topic explains the impact of a security notice being issued on security grounds in relation to an individual in receipt of

FA

or an

FTB

child, as well as information on review and appeal processes.

Issuing of a security notice

The Minister for Home Affairs (the Minister administering the

Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979

) may issue a security notice in relation to an individual if the individual has had:

their Australian passport cancelled, or their passport application refused, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or

their visa cancelled by the Minister for Home Affairs.

Before issuing the security notice, the Minister must consider:

the extent, if any, to which they are aware that any payments of FA of the individual are being, or may be, used for a purpose that might prejudice the security of Australia or a foreign country, and

the likely impact it would have on any of the individual's dependants if the Minister were to issue a security notice.

In these cases, the Minister will issue a security notice naming the individual in writing to the Minister for Social Services. The Minister for Social Services must provide a copy of the security notice to the Secretary of

DSS

and the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia.

Once issued, a security notice remains in force until it is revoked. The Minister for Home Affairs may give the Minister for Social Services a written notice revoking the security notice at any time. The Minister for Social Services must provide a copy of the revocation notice to the Secretary and the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia.

Impact of a security notice on an individual

If a security notice has been issued in relation to an individual, the individual is not eligible for FA payments and no FA payments can be paid to them while the security notice is in force. In general, this means any FA payments being paid to the individual when the security notice is issued should be cancelled. In limited cases, the FA payments can be paid to a payment nominee appointed by the Secretary, instead of being cancelled, if the security notice recommends this.

If the individual named in the security notice is aged less than 19 years on the day the notice is given, the individual cannot be considered an FTB child, a regular care child or a client of an approved care organisation while the security notice is in force. This means, any FA payments being paid to another individual or approved care organisation in respect of the individual named in the security notice should be cancelled.

If FA payments are cancelled as a result of a security notice, the Secretary (or their delegate) must take reasonable steps to notify the individual of the cancellation. Where an individual's payment and/or card has been cancelled and the security notice is later revoked, the Secretary (or their delegate) must take reasonable steps to notify the individual of the revocation.

Payment nominee

If FA payments are directed to be paid to a payment nominee, the payment nominee is appointed by the Secretary and must use the payments in accordance with a written direction of the Secretary. The nominee must adhere to all legislative requirements of payment nominees (

4.1.3.10

), as modified by the FAAct section 57GI.

Review & appeal of security notices

The decision to issue a security notice is made by the Minister for Home Affairs and not an officer under the FA legislation. As a consequence, decisions made under the relevant provisions to pay or not to pay FA are taken not to be decisions of an officer under the FA legislation therefore they cannot be reviewed under the FA(Admin)Act Part 5.

However, the decision to cancel a person's FA payment may be subject to a judicial review under the

Judiciary Act 1903

section 39B or

The Constitution

section 75(v).

2.8.4.80 ACCS (transition to work) - most beneficial participation type principle

Summary

This topic explains the most beneficial participation type principle, and outlines the time limits that apply to multiple activities for

ACCS

(transition to work).

Two or more activities - the most beneficial participation type principle

Where an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is participating in 2 or more participation types that meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements, the individual can select which of their participation types they would like assessed for ACCS (transition to work).

Where more than one is selected, the officer (

1.1.O.10

) assessing the application will apply the highest time limit that can be applied, depending on the participation types nominated by the individual. This is the most beneficial participation type principle.

If an individual does not nominate which

CCS

participation types they wish to apply for ACCS (transition to work) the officer assessing the application can decide based on the most beneficial participation type principle.

The general hierarchy, based on the highest period being applied first, is:

study

training - vocational training (including

LMP

s)

training - other program to improve employment prospects (including government funded rehabilitation programs)

work - paid work, unpaid work (including a work experience placement or an internship) and setting up a business

job search.

The time limit is applied by Centrelink based on the evidence provided, such as the length of the course, training or other program. If no time limit is nominated by the individual and no evidence in relation to the time limit is provided, additional evidence can be requested.

If a participation type is ongoing and no end date is provided such as in the case of work or for looking for work, the maximum of 26 weeks would be applied.

Example:

Georgie is working and studying a Certificate III, and has selected both in her ACCS (transition to work) application. As study has the longer time limit, Georgie's activity will be recorded as study and a 104-week time limit for study will apply.

More than one activity requirement met

In some cases, the participation type an individual is participating in may meet more than one of the activity requirements under ACCS (transition to work). In particular, components of LMPs may be assessed under more than one activity requirement. For example, the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) has components of training and setting up a business. An individual undertaking this may have that program assessed as both training (for that component of the course) and work (setting up a business).

In addition, some vocational training courses may meet the Australian Qualifications Framework level requirements and could be assessed as a study activity instead of a work or training requirement. As study has a higher time limit than work or training activities, the study limit will be applied as it is the most beneficial.

In this case, the individual can nominate which activity's time limits they would like to apply.

However, the officer assessing the application will decide which activity to record, and which time limit will apply to provide the greatest benefit to the individual.

3.1.6.60 Stage 1 - no registered or informal agreement or court order

Individual is not receiving maintenance (

1.1.M.10

)

Stage 1 individuals should be referred to a Legal Aid agency or solicitor for help to seek child maintenance (

1.1.C.20

), if they:

are not exempt from taking reasonable maintenance action

are not receiving child maintenance under an informal agreement

do not have a court order (

1.1.C.70

) or registered agreement, and

do not have legal proceedings underway.

Individuals should be advised that if they choose to engage the services of a private solicitor they must bear any associated costs. Individuals are entitled to financial assistance from Legal Aid if they meet the legal aid income and asset test requirements.

Centrelink staff should obtain information about coordinating referrals with Legal Aid.

The process for seeking a court order for maintenance

If the parties are seeking a court order for maintenance, the Individual lodges an application for maintenance with the Family Court or a court that has jurisdiction under the

Family Law Act 1975

.

Example:

A local or magistrate's court.

At the preliminary hearing the parties, if agreed, may register an agreement with the court, or the court may make an order by consent. If the case is contested, the court will adjourn the hearing to another date.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.30

Taking reasonable maintenance action,

3.1.5.70

Exemptions from the maintenance action test

Reasonable maintenance action - legal proceedings initiated

Individuals taking legal action for child maintenance are required to lodge an application with the court within 13 weeks of being advised by Centrelink of the requirement to take action, in order to meet the

MAT

.

The individual must be asked to produce the copy of the form at the 13 week review, if they have not already done so. The case should be reviewed at the date of the hearing.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.40

Maintenance action in progress

Delays in legal process

There may be cases where action has been delayed because of legal processes. In these circumstances the individual must produce a letter from a legal adviser giving the reasons for the delay. An extension of the time limit should be granted as necessary to the circumstances.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.90

Maintenance action test reviews

Centrelink action after preliminary hearing

After the preliminary hearing, the individual must advise Centrelink if:

a consent order has been made, or

a date has been set for a further hearing.

If a further hearing has been set, the review date is coded as the hearing date and the individual should be asked to notify Centrelink of the outcome of that hearing.

Individual makes an informal agreement

If the individual has made an informal agreement (

1.1.M.15

), child maintenance is assessed from the date of first payment. This must be within 13 weeks to meet the reasonable maintenance action guidelines, unless it is considered that the individual is continuing to take action or the delay is beyond their control.

Action not taken

If the individual has not made an informal agreement or lodged an application with the court, action should be taken to reduce their rate of

FTB

to the base rate for the child.

3.1.7.11 Assessable maintenance income

Summary

This topic provides information about assessable maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) income, and includes the following:

how maintenance can be received

maintenance liability (

1.1.M.23

), and

different types of maintenance.

Any benefit or payment for the maintenance of the child and/or the payee (

1.1.P.71

) is assessable maintenance, unless it is specifically exempt. Generally, any maintenance income that should be counted under the maintenance income test (MIT) is accounted for under a child support agreement or child support assessment. This is especially true for those who receive their maintenance via a private collect arrangement. For private collect individuals, the amount reflected in the child support assessment, agreement, or notional assessment is the amount that is deemed to be received. For Child Support collect cases, where a payer pays more than their assessed liability and they are not in arrears, the Registrar will not disburse these amounts to the payee until they are due. This means these additional amounts will not be counted under the MIT until they are disbursed. Arrears amounts from previous years will be disbursed and counted under the MIT in the year they are received.

The exception to this rule is voluntary maintenance (

1.1.V.20

), which is maintenance paid by a person while they do not have a maintenance liability because no agreement or assessment is in place.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3-'maintenance income', section 3-‘capitalised maintenance income’, section 19 Maintenance income, Schedule 1 clause 20C Working out amounts of child maintenance in relation to lump sum payments

Maintenance income test - general provisions

How maintenance can be received

Maintenance can be received as:

cash (periodic and lump sum payments)

non-cash maintenance, or

capitalised maintenance.

Maintenance can be paid to the payee, or the child. Assessable maintenance includes:

child maintenance (see Explanation 1)

partner maintenance (see Explanation 2), or

maintenance paid directly to the child.

Explanation 1:

Maintenance paid for the child to the payee, grandparent or other person to whom the court has appointed custody of the child.

Explanation 2:

Maintenance paid for the payee.

Maintenance can be paid by the other parent of the child, or by the partner or former partner of a parent of the child.

Example:

Marie is a payer. She has a maintenance liability for her 2 children. Marie's new partner contributes to the amount of maintenance she pays. The whole amount is assessable for the payee.

Maintenance liability

The individual must take reasonable action to seek maintenance in order to receive more than the base rate of

FTB

(

1.1.B.10

) for a child from a previous relationship. The payer's (

1.1.P.72

) maintenance liability may be worked out under Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the

CSS

. The payee can collect their maintenance privately (

1.1.P.130

), or through Child Support.

Voluntary maintenance is also assessable under the maintenance income test.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.30

Taking reasonable maintenance action

Cash maintenance

Maintenance received as a cash amount or credited to the payee's bank account is cash maintenance. Cash maintenance can be collected by Child Support or privately. The actual amount received is the amount that is assessed.

Cash maintenance can be received as a periodic amount paid at a weekly, monthly, annual or other periodic interval. A periodic amount is expressed in terms that require payments of a regular amount on a recurring or cyclical basis.

Cash maintenance can also be in the form of a lump sum which is not in respect of a particular period (unlike capitalised maintenance). Such lump sums may be specified in a child support agreement or court order and may be credited by Child Support. They are assessed in the financial year they are received and are annualised as part of the overall MIT.

Non-cash maintenance

Non-cash maintenance is a benefit or payment for the maintenance of the child or payee. It may be given directly to the payee or the child, or may be paid to a third party on their behalf.

Examples:

The following benefits may be provided as non-cash maintenance:

food, clothing or other household items or repairs

mortgage payments, rent or free lodging

health insurance and medical expenses

loan, credit card and store account repayments

child care fees, school and tuition fees

sporting costs including fees, equipment, related travel and accommodation

travel or holiday expenses

utility bills including electricity, gas, telephone and heating

council, water and sewerage rates, and

motor vehicle expenses.

The value to the individual of the non-cash maintenance is assessable under the MIT. The value of non-cash maintenance counted under the MIT will be reflected in the payee's child support assessment or agreement (that is, there is no need to assess the non-cash separately). However, for private collect cases, there may be instances where it is unreasonable to expect the payee to collect the full amount under their assessment. In such cases, a partial exemption from the

MAT

may be warranted.

If there is a need to decide whether an amount of benefit or payment should be assessed as maintenance (for example, if a decision maker needs to factor in a non-cash amount in assessing a partial exemption from the MAT), the following 3 points should be considered:

is the payment from (directly or indirectly), a parent of the child/ren or a partner or former partner of a parent of the child/ren

has the payment or benefit been received, and

is the payment for the support of the payee or the child/ren?

If the answer to all of the above is yes, then the payment or the value of the benefit may be assessed as non-cash maintenance. If the answer to any of the above questions is no, then the payment or the value of the benefit is not considered as maintenance.

The facts of each individual case should be taken into account. What is significant is the nature and purpose of the payment.

Capitalised maintenance income

Capitalised maintenance is maintenance that is paid as a lump sum to satisfy a maintenance liability for a period of time. Capitalised maintenance is apportioned over the capitalisation period.

1.1.A.05 Absences (CCS, ACCS)

Definition

Absences occur when a child does not attend a session of care (

1.1.S.40

) they would have normally attended at their approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

), and the family is charged for that care.

If a child is absent from one or more sessions of care on a day, the absence is counted only once. For example, if a child is absent from both before and after school care on the same day, only one absence is counted.

Each child is allowed an initial 42 absence days from care for which CCS can be paid across all child care services during each financial year. These 42 allowable absences (

4.7.1

) can be used for any reason, including public holidays, and do not require supporting documentation. Once the 42 allowable absences are used, CCS and ACCS is only payable for valid additional absences (

4.7.2

).

3.5.5 CCS & ACCS - exceptional circumstances

Summary

Individuals (

1.1.I.90

) eligible for

CCS

or

ACCS

can make an application for a subsidised hours result in exceptional circumstances where they:

do not meet and are not exempt from reporting participation details and require access to subsidised care

meet or are exempt from reporting participation details but require access to additional hours of subsidised child care.

The Centrelink delegate will make the decision on a case-by-case basis.

This section includes:

intent

evidence

change of circumstances

examples

scenarios.

Intent

In certain circumstances it would be unreasonable for an individual and, if they have one, their partner (

1.1.P.30

), to satisfy the participation requirements or care for their or their partner's children. The exceptional circumstances provision ensures individuals have sufficient access to child care to enable children to be safely cared for while their parent/s or carer/s are otherwise engaged due to exceptional circumstances.

In exceptional circumstances individuals can apply to Centrelink and provide documentary evidence of their circumstances. Centrelink will consider these circumstances and make a case‑by-case determination of the hours of subsidised care parents will be entitled to, which could be more than 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight, and the length of time the exceptional circumstances activity test will apply for (no longer than one year).

If the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

), they will need to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances impact both themselves and their partner. If the exceptional circumstances only relate to the individual, the family's result will still be based on the lower of the individual and their partner's results. This means, for example, if the individual was engaging in paid work for more than 48 hours per fortnight but their partner was not undertaking any participation, the family's subsidised hours result will be the basic subsidy amount of 72 hours per fortnight (the lower of the individual and their partner's results).

Evidence

The individual is required to provide evidence to support their exceptional circumstances application. Evidence could include, but is not limited to:

court documentation

medical or death certificates

declaration of natural disaster

signed statement from social worker, counsellor, doctor, or other party

receipts and invoices of medical and funeral expenses

fire report, police report or insurance report

any other evidence that the individual has that could explain their circumstances.

If documentation cannot be provided (for example, due to an emergency situation), a Commonwealth statutory declaration supporting the individual's submission must be submitted.

Change of circumstances

If an individual's circumstances change, and the exceptional circumstances no longer apply (for example, exceptional circumstances were applied due to hospitalisation, and now the individual is no longer in hospital), they are obliged to notify Centrelink of the change. Once the individual has notified Centrelink, they may no longer have an entitlement to CCS (unless they are undertaking recognised participation types or are otherwise exempt from reporting participation details).

Types of exceptional circumstances

Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, where the individual, their partner, or the child are:

affected by domestic violence (

1.1.F.15

)

experiencing serious illness or a medical condition or hospitalisation preventing an individual from working or caring for their child

experiencing serious mental health issues that prevent the individual working or caring for the child

participating in a treatment or rehabilitation program to address substance abuse issues that prevents the individual working or caring for the child

impacted by significant trauma

experiencing short-term incapacity

attending a funeral or bereavement service or the resolution of an estate where long distance travel is required

responding to an emergency in their capacity as an employee (for example, State Emergency Service (SES) during fires)

complying with a compulsory obligation imposed by the court (for example, undertaking community service, being on jury duty or being a witness).

Exceptional circumstances do NOT include where individuals use more sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) than their subsidised hours because of child care services' (

1.1.A.90

) charging practices. For example, because the individual works full time and their child attends a child care service that charges 12 hour sessions, meaning they do not have enough subsidised care to cover the child's attendance at the service 5 days a week.

Example:

Juliet leaves her home with her 2 children to move into crisis accommodation due to domestic violence. She is not able to work or undertake any other recognised participation types during this time but requires access to subsidised child care to ensure her children are safely cared for, to provide continuity for the children during this period and to enable Juliet to set up a life away from her partner. Juliet is eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing) but also makes an exceptional circumstances application, explaining that she will need to place both her children in long day care each day until she finds secure accommodation. The delegate determines Juliet's subsidised hours result to be 120 hours per fortnight for 2 CCS fortnights.

Example:

James is a single father who works less than 48 hours per fortnight and has a subsidised hours result of 72 hours per fortnight. James also volunteers with the SES. A fire is threatening James' local area and he is asked to participate in fighting fires and be on call for the next week. James makes an exceptional circumstances submission outlining that he requires constant care from his family day care educator for his 5 year old daughter Alice for this week to enable him to fight fires and be on call, and that as a single father he has no one else who can care for Alice who is not old enough to be left alone. James' subsidised hours result is increased to 336 hours for 2 weeks to ensure he can be available to carry out his duties as an SES volunteer.

Example:

Marlene and Ian each work 5 days a week and are entitled to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. Their child care service charges for 12 hour sessions of care meaning Marlene's child Anne uses 120 hours of care per fortnight. If Marlene made an exceptional circumstances request for additional hours of subsidised care, Marlene and Ian's subsidised hours result will NOT be increased because this is a routine occurrence resulting from the business practices of approved providers (

1.1.A.90

).

CCS - recognised participation

ACCS individuals & exceptional circumstances

In exceptional circumstances, individuals receiving ACCS (

2.8

) can apply to receive more than 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight, or to receive a payment rate that is higher than the relevant hourly rate cap.

However, where individuals are receiving ACCS (child wellbeing) their approved provider applies on their behalf to receive a payment rate that is higher than 120% of the relevant hourly rate cap.

What constitutes 'exceptional circumstances', and what evidence (if any) needs to be provided, is not prescribed. This is because an exceptional circumstance is generally unusual or 'out of the ordinary' in terms of its impact on the particular family using child care. However, the evidence requirements and types of exceptional circumstances as listed earlier on this page, may apply or be considered.

3.7.2 Payment rates for ACCS (transition to work)

Payment rates for ACCS (transition to work)

ACCS

(transition to work) subsidy rate is up to 95% of the actual fee charged by an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

), or up to 95% of the relevant

CCS

hourly rate cap (

3.5.3

) (whichever is lower). There are no provisions to enable ACCS (transition to work) to be paid at a rate higher than 95%.

The hourly rate cap depends on the type of approved child care that an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is using and the child's age (age not relevant for

FDC

or

IHC

).

The types of care include:

centre-based day care

outside school hours care

family day care, and

in home care.

The hourly rate cap is designed to provide support to those families that are genuinely in need within appropriate financial limits.

Where the approved provider charges under the hourly rate cap, the individual will be responsible for paying the remaining 5% of the fee charged.

Where the approved provider charges above the hourly rate cap, the individual will be responsible for paying the remaining 5% of the hourly rate cap and the full difference between the hourly rate cap and the fee charged by the provider.

Note:

The CCS hourly rate caps will be increased by the

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year.

3.2.9 Reportable superannuation contributions

Summary

This topic explains the assessment of reportable superannuation contributions (

1.1.R.35

) for the

FTB

,

CCS

,

ACCS

and

SBP

income tests.

Reportable superannuation contributions

As of July 2009, reportable superannuation contributions are included as a component of

ATI

for

FA

purposes.

Reportable superannuation contributions include discretionary contributions (also known as concessional or before-tax contributions). These can be split into 2 components:

reportable employer superannuation contributions, and

personal deductible superannuation contributions.

Note:

Mandated employer paid superannuation contributions (superannuation guarantee) are not 'reportable employer superannuation contributions'.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 2(1)(f) the individual's reportable superannuation contributions …

Reportable employer superannuation contributions

Reportable employer superannuation contributions are employer superannuation contributions that could have been received by the employee as income. The reportable employer superannuation contributions are in addition to the legally required employer contributions such as those made under the superannuation guarantee laws or an industrial award. The contribution would also be one in which it could be reasonably expected that the employee had capacity to negotiate with their employer regarding the size of the amount, or the way the amount is contributed so as to reduce their assessable income. A common example is contributions made on the employee's behalf by an employer under a salary sacrifice arrangement.

Example:

Mary receives a salary of $40,000 in the 2016-17 income year. Her employer is legally required to contribute 9.5% (or $3,800) to her superannuation fund. Mary also enters into a salary sacrifice arrangement with her employer, to sacrifice $10,000 of her earnings into her fund.

The $3,800 is a legally mandated contribution, and is not a reportable superannuation contribution. Therefore, it does not need to be reported to Centrelink for FA purposes.

The $10,000 is an additional contribution paid at the request of Mary by her employer. This is a reportable employer superannuation contribution, and when calculating her FA eligibility, this amount will be counted as a component of Mary's ATI. Although Mary's taxable income is $30,000, her assessable income for the purposes of FA will be $40,000.

Note:

For the SBP income test, the amount added back in the above example would be only that portion of the $10,000 received during the relevant 6-month income test period. If the 6-month income test period falls entirely within the income year to which the $10,000 superannuation contribution relates, Mary would need to include half of that amount ($5,000) in her income estimate.

Example:

Mike pays his employees a bonus each year if they meet their performance targets. Under a long standing agreement, one of Mike's employees has elected to have Mike pay the amount of any bonus into their superannuation fund, the amount will be a reportable employer superannuation contribution.

Personal deductible superannuation contributions

Personal deductible superannuation contributions are personal contributions made by a self-employed person or by an employee to a superannuation fund for which an income tax deduction is claimed on an individual's tax return.

Assessing reportable superannuation contributions

For the purposes of the SBP income test, individuals (

1.1.I.90

) and/or their partners (

1.1.P.30

) need to state the amount of superannuation contributions they have received for the relevant 6-month income test period. For further details on how the income test period is defined see

4.15.1

.

Actual amounts of reportable superannuation contributions used in estimate - FTB, CCS & ACCS only

An individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalment or CCS or ACCS, can update their estimate of ATI with the actual amount of reportable superannuation contributions.

Estimates for the purposes of the SBP income test do not need to be updated, as they are based on the 'best efforts' of the individual and will not be reconciled with actual income (

3.2.8.10

).

Reportable superannuation contributions - affected payments

The income test for the following programs include the reportable employer superannuation contributions of an individual and their spouse (where applicable). The other component of reportable superannuation contributions - personal deductible contributions - are already assessed for an individual, and their spouse, for income support program purposes.

Austudy payment

CP

(adult)

CP (child)

disability support pension

income test, residential aged care

jobseeker payment

PP

(single or partnered)

special benefit

YA

(personal income test).

The following payments also assess both reportable employer superannuation contributions and personal deductible contributions, for individuals of all ages:

ABSTUDY

living allowance (parental income test, family actual means test, personal income test)

ABSTUDY (rent assistance)

additional boarding allowance,

AIC

Scheme

child care benefit

child care subsidy

additional child care subsidy

FTB Part A

FTB Part B

higher education loan program

student financial supplement scheme, and

YA (parental income test, family actual means test, personal income test).

From 1 March 2014, SBP also assesses both reportable employer superannuation contributions and personal deductible contributions, for individuals of all ages.

2.3.2 Approval of an ACO

Summary

This section covers the policy relating to the approval of care organisations to be eligible for

FTB

.

How to apply for

ACO

status

Applications from care organisations for ACO (

1.1.A.80

) status must be made in writing and must include the following information:

details about the organisation such as the body conducting it (see example)

a copy of the organisation's latest financial statement, unless the organisation is funded by the Commonwealth, a state or territory

the number of children resident at the date of application and the total number that can be accommodated

full details of the payments received by the organisation for each child's maintenance

details of children who are receiving a pension, allowance or benefit in their own right

for children not born in Australia (

1.1.A.120

), whether they

have been resident in Australia during the 12 months immediately before the application, or

are likely to remain here permanently, and

the date that the organisation admitted its first resident.

Example:

The body's aims and objectives, the categories of children catered for, and the type of programs or training it provides.

Approval of care organisations

An application from a care organisation for payment of FTB can be approved if:

the organisation provides or co-ordinates residential care services to young people in Australia, and

the organisation's financial statements support this assessment.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 20(1) Approval of organisations providing residential care services to young people

Assessment of financial statements

An organisation funded by a state government can readily be accepted as suitable for FTB purposes.

If an organisation seems to be operating on an unsound or a questionable financial basis, Centrelink will request further details.

Adoption & foster care agencies

Organisations such as foster care agencies that arrange pre-adoptive foster care may be accepted as ACOs. While the child is in the physical care of a foster parent, they may be considered to remain a 'resident' of the organisation in the sense that the foster care agency retains responsibility for the child. However each case must be considered individually. If a foster carer claims FTB for a child and is responsible for the daily care and welfare of the child, the foster carer may be eligible for FTB instead of the ACO.

Withdrawal of approval

A delegate may decide to withdraw approval from an ACO and advise the organisation accordingly. Reasons for withdrawing approval may include:

the ACO indicates it wants to relinquish its status, or

no FTB payments have been made for 12 months.

1.1.P.19 Parenting order

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

and the SSAct, and under

Family Law Act 1975

section 64B the Family Law Court issues parenting orders. There are 5 types of parenting orders including:

an order dealing with the allocation of parental responsibility for a child

an order dealing with the person or persons with whom a child will live, but does not usually allocate legal responsibility to a particular person

an order dealing with the time a child is to spend with or the communication a child is to have with another person or other persons - may include references to short term living arrangements but ongoing living arrangements are usually contained in the type of order above

a child maintenance order - covers child support, and

a specific issues order - relates to any aspect of parental responsibility that does not fall under one of the other 4 types of parenting orders (that is, day-to-day care, welfare, development, education, religion and legal responsibility).

It is possible for a parent to have only one, or possibly all 5, parenting orders applied to them. The content of a parenting order will vary from case to case and must be read carefully to identify the relevant information. A parenting order differs from a registered parenting plan in that it may also include other adults, in addition to a child's parents, as having responsibility or care of the child.

7.4 Child support debts

Introduction

This chapter explains the provisions relating to child support debts and covers:

individuals to whom this measure applies

notice to Secretary of requirement to recover child support debts from

FTB

recovery from FTB instalment and past period payments

formula for working out the maximum recoverable amount under section 228

payments not to be included in the recovery amount

other debt recoveries from FTB, and

appeals and reviews.

Summary

Child Support may, at its discretion, request that debt is recovered from the FTB paid to an individual who owes a child support debt. Child support debts recovered from FTB payments are paid to the Child Support Registrar.

Individuals to whom this measure applies

Individuals who fail to pay a child support debt in respect of one or more designated child support children (

1.1.D.75

) by the due date, and who are also entitled to be paid FTB for those children, may have their child support debts recovered from their FTB payments. The FTB payment for those children may be reduced to nil as a result of the deductions.

If an individual who has an existing child support debt re-partners and the new partner receives FTB in respect of the debtor's children, this measure does not apply to the new partner's FTB in respect of those children.

Act reference:

CSRC Act

section 72AB Deductions from FTB

Notice to Secretary of requirement to recover child support debts from FTB

Child support debts can be recovered from FTB only upon the Child Support Registrar giving the Secretary a written notice under section 72AB of the CSRC Act to make the recovery. Among other things, the written notice must specify either:

the method of working out the recovery amount (which must be in accordance with section 228 of the FA(Admin)Act), or

the dollar amount to be recovered.

If the Registrar specifies in the section 72AB notice the dollar amount to be recovered, that amount cannot exceed:

the child support debt owing, or

the maximum amount recoverable under section 228 of the FA(Admin)Act.

Act reference:

CSRC Act

section 72AB Deductions from FTB

Recovery from FTB instalment & past period payments

Recovery can be made from FTB instalment payments and from lump sums as a result of past period claims or as a result of reconciliation.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 227 Payment of deductions to Child Support Registrar

Formula for working out the maximum recoverable amount under section 228

The following table outlines the formulae to be applied when working out the maximum amount that can be recovered from FTB in respect of a child support debt.

If …

then the recovery amount is …

all the individual's children are designated child support children (

1.1.D.75

) and the debtor is not on income support (

1.1.I.50

) or an income support supplement

the child support debt owing or the individual's total FTB entitlement, whichever is less.

some of the individual's children are not designated child support children

the child support debt owing or the difference between the individual's existing total FTB entitlement and their FTB entitlement if the designated child support child was not the individual's child, whichever is less.

Example:

Joe has full care of Sally who is 8, and Brett who is 4 years old. Joe also has 35% care of Adam (10), who is a designated child support child. The limit is worked out by deducting Y from X, where:

X = Joe's total FTB entitlement for Sally, Brett and Adam

Y = Joe's FTB entitlement without Adam (designated child support child)

Therefore, the section 228 limit is the child support debt or the difference between X and Y, whichever is less.

all the individual's children are designated child support children and the individual is on income support or an income support supplement

the child support debt owing or the difference between the individual's existing FTB entitlement and the 'foregone amount', whichever is less.

The foregone amount is the difference between the individual's income support, assuming no entitlement to FTB, and the individual's income support, assuming entitlement to FTB.

Explanation:

This is to protect from recovery any

RA

, which would be paid with the income support if the individual ceased to receive FTB.

Example:

Tony is a single parent on

JSP

and receives maximum rate RA. He has 35% care of Stephen, who is 11 years old. The section 228 amount is worked out by deducting Y from X, where:

X = Tony's FTB entitlement

Y = 'foregone amount': income support (assuming no FTB) - income support (assuming FTB paid)

Therefore, the section 228 limit is the child support debt or the difference between X and Y, whichever is less.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 228 Maximum deduction

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.4.30

Rent assistance

Payments not included in the recovery amount

Child support debts cannot be recovered from FTB advances. They can still be recovered during the advance repayment period from the ongoing fortnightly FTB payments paid to an advance individual. The formula above for working out the maximum recoverable amount would be applied to the fortnightly amount paid during the advance repayment period.

Note:

Individuals who receive FTB by instalments and who have an outstanding child support debt being withheld from their payments on the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

) will be ineligible to receive an FTB advance. This includes individuals who have elected to receive a regular advance (

1.2.8.10

) payment.

section 35A Entitlement to FTB advance, section 35B Regular FTB advances

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.2.8

FTB advance - description,

2.7

Entitlement to FTB advance payment

Other debt recoveries from FTB

The recovery of advance payments and family assistance and social security overpayments from FTB entitlements take precedence over the recovery of any child support debts. Any remaining FTB, following the recovery of advance payments, family assistance and social security overpayments, can be used for the recovery of child support debts in accordance with section 228 of the FA(Admin)Act.

Appeals & reviews

An individual can request a review of a Centrelink decision to recover child support debts from FTB payments under the family assistance law.

A request for a review or an appeal against such a decision by a delegate of the Secretary should follow normal review and appeal procedures.

2.8.1.10 ACCS (child wellbeing) - eligibility

Summary

This topic explains

ACCS

(child wellbeing) eligibility considerations for individuals (

1.1.I.90

) and child care providers (

1.1.A.90

) and covers:

eligibility for ACCS (child wellbeing)

limitations on eligibility.

Eligibility for ACCS (child wellbeing)

ACCS (child wellbeing) is available to individuals where they:

are eligible for

CCS

(

2.6.1

)

care for a child who is 'at risk' (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect.

In order to access ACCS (child wellbeing), an approved provider must give a certificate (

1.1.C.15

) or apply for a determination (

1.1.D.78

) for the child.

There may be no CCS eligible individual for a child at risk of serious abuse of neglect where:

the approved provider is unable to identify an eligible individual for a child (for example, where the individual does not meet the CCS residency requirements), or

a child is in a formal foster care arrangement (including kinship care).

In these limited circumstances a provider may still access ACCS (child wellbeing) under a Provider Eligible Arrangement (PEA) (

4.13.2.40

) for limited periods.

Limitation on eligibility

There are some circumstances where the individual and approved provider may not be eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing) in relation to a child. This includes where:

the eligibility requirements for CCS are not met (

2.6.1

) and there is no valid exemption

there is no CCS eligible individual, and the child does not meet the criteria for a PEA

a child is no longer considered at risk.

1.1.D.75 Designated child support child (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of recovery of child support debts from

FTB

, a designated child support child of a person has the same meaning as in

CSRC Act

section 72AB. Section 72AB applies to a person if the person is:

entitled to FTB

the child for whom the person is eligible for FTB is a designated child support child of the person, and

that child is an FTB child or a regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) who is also a rent assistance child.

A child of a person is a designated child support child of a person if:

the person has a registrable maintenance liability under the CSRC Act section 17 in respect of the child

an amount payable under the liability is a child support debt in respect of the child, and

the debt has remained unpaid (in whole or part) and it is past the date which the debt became due and payable under the CSRC Act section 66.

3.1.8.10 Method 2 - calculating the maximum rate of FTB Part A

When to use Method 2

Method 2 applies when an individual's

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is more than their higher income free area (

1.1.H.10

). It applies a 30% reduction on ATI over the higher income free area to the individual's maximum rate.

The maximum rate of

FTB

Part A under Method 2 equals the base rate under Method 1.

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is only included in Method 2 calculations where the combined ATI is less than or equal to $80,000 for the relevant income year.

From 20 March 2017

ES

ceased for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. Therefore, ES will only be included in Method 2 calculations for grandfathered individuals. See

8.2

.

Components of maximum rate of FTB Part A using Method 2

The components are:

the standard rate for Method 2

the standard rate for ES Part A for Method 2

newborn supplement

multiple birth allowance, and

FTB Part A supplement.

Paying the higher rate of Method 1 & Method 2

An individual whose ATI exceeds the higher income free area is assessed under Method 2. However, in certain circumstances, such as larger families, the individual may be entitled to a higher rate under Method 1 than under Method 2. To ensure these individuals are not disadvantaged, the income and maintenance tested rate calculated using Method 1 and the rate calculated using Method 2 is compared and the higher of the 2 rates is paid.

Note:

From 1 July 2019, if a family's ATI is more than the higher income free area, their maximum rate of FTB Part A is reduced by 30% of the income excess. This applies both when the family's rate is calculated using Method 2 and when it is calculated using Method 1 under Step 3 of the Method 2 income test.

Policy reference:

Effect of shared care on the FTB child rate

is not affected by a shared care determination.

4.4.1 Reasons for FTB reassessment

Reasons for reassessments

The following table outlines the situations in which a reassessment of

FTB

is required.

A reassessment of FTB is required when …

an individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalments notifies Centrelink of a change in circumstances.

Explanation:

As a result the individual may be:

ineligible for FTB, or

eligible for a different rate of FTB.

an individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalments revises their and/or their partner's income estimate (

1.1.P.30

)

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

).

TFN

s are not provided within 28 days of a request for them, or

the Commissioner of Taxation tells Centrelink within 28 days of a request for TFN details that the individual has

no TFN

not applied for a TFN, or

had their TFN application refused or has withdrawn their application.

the individual has not provided bank account details within 28 days of lodging an FTB claim.

income tax returns for the individual and/or their current partner have been lodged following the end of the income year in which an FTB determination was in force, if required to lodge a tax return, allowing reconciliation to take place (

6.4.3

).

income tax returns for the individual and/or their current partner have not been lodged on or before the end of the income year following the income year in which an FTB determination was in force (that is, first lodgement year), if required to lodge a tax return.

Note:

Where an individual and/or their partner is not required to lodge an income tax return, they are still required to notify Centrelink of their ATI within the same time period.

the individual and their partner cease to be members of a couple and the income tax return for the ex-partner has not been lodged before the end of the income year following the income year in which an FTB determination was in force (i.e. first lodgement year), if required to lodge a tax return.

the individual has not provided requested information and/or documents within the required timeframe.

an individual underestimates their ATI and the estimate is not considered reasonable.

an FTB or regular care child claims a social security benefit (

1.1.S.60

), pension (

1.1.S.90

),

LMP

payment (

1.1.L.10

) or prescribed educational scheme payment (

1.1.P.100

).

an individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalments fails to advise Centrelink of a change of address where there is reason to believe that the individual's address has changed and the Secretary is unable to find out whether the individual's address has changed or, if it has, what the new address is.

Example:

A letter is returned marked:

'returned to sender', or

'not known at this address'.

an individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalments lodges a request to be paid an advance of FTB.

an automated review results in a variation of the original decision, or results in a new decision being made which affects the individual's FTB entitlement.

Example:

Centrelink must conduct a review of FTB entitlement where a known event is due to occur, such as an end date for a course of study or when an FTB child turns 16 or 18 years of age.

an individual initiates a review which results in a variation of the original decision or results in a new decision being made which affects the individual's FTB entitlement.

Example:

If an individual's circumstances were incorrectly assessed, they may ask Centrelink to undertake a review of their FTB entitlement.

an individual, not in receipt of an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

), asks Centrelink to cease their entitlement to FTB by fortnightly payments.

Example:

The individual wants to claim FTB for the remainder of an income year as a lump sum payment.

the Commissioner of Taxation, the individual and/or their partner amends the individual and/or their partner's income tax assessment after reconciliation.

there is an indexation-related increase in:

FTB Part A rates

maximum

RA

the rent threshold for RA

multiple birth allowance

the standard rate of FTB Part B

the rate of FTB payable to

ACO

s

the higher income free area (

1.1.I.40

) for FTB Part A

the FTB Part B primary earner (

1.1.P.122

) income limit (

1.1.I.45

)

the income free area for FTB Part A

the secondary earner income free area for FTB Part B

the FTB gross supplement amounts for Parts A and B

the standard basic

MIFA

for FTB Part A

the double basic MIFA for FTB Part A, and/or

the additional MIFA for FTB Part A.

an individual who receives FTB by fortnightly instalments fails to advise Centrelink in advance of any absence from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) and Centrelink becomes aware at a later stage that the individual travelled overseas.

Centrelink receives information that a child has met health check or immunisation requirements for a particular income year, after payments for that income year have been reconciled.

Note:

The

ES

(Part A and B) and ES ACO rates ceased to be indexed from 20 September 2014.

6.6.3 Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to underestimation of income - exceptions

Summary

There are exceptions for certain circumstances that will also allow individuals to regain access to

FTB

based on an estimate and linked benefits where they have lost entitlement due to having 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement. These include where any of the following events occur after the 2 years of zero entitlement. The individual:

becomes an income support individual

has a new FTB child come into their care

separates from their partner

establishes a rate greater than nil for a more recent entitlement year, or

resumes their eligibility to FTB.

Generally, these will apply automatically when the event occurs or notification of a change of circumstances is provided by the individual in the general course of business. However, exceptions granted under special circumstances category will not be automatic.

An individual can also have multiple exceptions applying to them at once. Therefore, if one exception ceases to apply, another may take effect. Exceptions with the most beneficial effect (that is, earliest date of effect) should be applied first.

Exceptions are also tied to specific consecutive years of non-entitlement.

Example:

Mike has 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement for 2019-20 and 2020-21. However, an exception is granted from 1 July 2022 because a new FTB child has come into their care on 31 July 2021 (since the 2 consecutive years). Therefore, the exception is for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 years only. If it is later determined that Mike had no entitlement for the 2021-22 year due to underestimation of income, even with the new child in their care they will be subject to non-entitlement due to 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 years.

6.6.1

Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to underestimation of income

Income support individual

If at any time after the end of the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years the individual or their partner received a social security pension, a social security benefit, a service pension, veteran payment or income support supplement they will be excepted from non-entitlement. This exception continues to apply even if the individual or their partner has since ceased to be in receipt of any income support payments.

Example:

Mary has nil FTB entitlement for both 2019-20 and 2020-21, therefore they are non-entitled from 1 July 2022. On 1 September 2022, Mary is granted an income support payment. Mary will be exempt from non-entitlement from 1 July 2022 given they have received an income support payment after the end of the 2 years of non-entitlement.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AI Exception-income support payments

New FTB child

If, since the end of the 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement, an FTB child comes into the individual's care that was not a child in their care at any time during the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement, this exception will apply.

This provision includes a regular care child (RCC) of the individual who has changed their level of care since the 2 years of non-entitlement and is now deemed to be an FTB child of the individual.

Example:

John received FTB Part A via instalments in respect of Jason for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 years. For both of these years, John was found to be non-entitled to payment due to underestimation of income. On 13 January 2022, John's partner gave birth to a new child, Lara. As Lara only came into John's care since the end of the 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement, John will remain entitled on 1 July 2022.

However, if after the 2021-22 year is reconciled it is found that John has no entitlement for that year due to underestimation of income, even with a new child, they will be subject to non-entitlement, as there is a new 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 years.

Further, an FTB child coming into care will include individuals who partner since the end of the 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement, with an individual who also has an FTB child.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AJ Exception-new FTB child

Couple separates

This exception will apply if, at any time since the end of the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement, the individual separates from a person who was their partner at the end of the 2 zero entitlement years. This exception will continue to apply even if the individual re-partners with a new partner.

However, if the individual reconciles with the person who was their partner at the end of the 2 consecutive zero entitlement years, they will be non-entitled unless a different exception applies.

Example:

Jane was partnered with Paul on 30 June 2021. Jane has no entitlement to FTB for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 years.

On 1 September 2021, Jane and Paul separate. On 2 September 2021 Jane partners with Julie. As a result of this, Jane (and Paul) will be exempted from preclusion on 1 July 2022 regardless of the fact that Jane has re-partnered since the end of the 2-year non-entitlement period.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AK Exception-couple separates

Greater than nil rate of FTB for later income year

If an individual is found to be entitled to FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B at a rate greater than nil based on actual

ATI

for a more recent income year since the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement, this exception will apply.

This may be either through a lump sum or reconciled instalment claim which is for a year that falls any time after the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement that have resulted in the individual being non-entitled.

Example:

Cassandra becomes non-entitled on 1 July 2022 because of consecutive years 2019-20 and 2020-21 of zero entitlement. On 1 November 2022 Cassandra's entitlement is reconciled for 2021-22, which yields entitlement greater than nil. This means Cassandra is excepted from non-entitlement and is considered to be entitled to FTB based on an estimate from 1 July 2022.

This exception will continue until a new 2 consecutive years of nil-entitlement are accrued or Cassandra's entitlement for 2021-22 is re-reconciled as nil.

Note:

Individuals who have been granted an exception due to separation and later establish an entitlement greater than nil can be given a new exception under this category. However, if the individual later re-partners with the original partner they were with when they lost entitlement, and the Secretary is reasonably assured the individual only established entitlement greater than nil due to being single, they will lose their greater than nil rate exception upon their separation exception being revoked and become non-entitled again.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AG Exception-greater than nil rate of FTB for later income year

Resumption of eligibility for FTB

If the individual was not eligible for FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B for the whole of an income year (ineligible year) following the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement, and ineligibility was for a non-income related reason (for example, they did not have an FTB child), they may qualify for an exception. To test this, the individual must provide Centrelink with a copy of their

ATO

notice of assessment for the ineligible year. Centrelink will then use this, in conjunction with the individual's current circumstances, to establish whether the individual has any entitlement to FTB on the basis of that income in the current income year. If they do, the exemption will be applied.

Example:

Nathan has no entitlement to FTB for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 years for which they received FTB instalments for their child Sam. Nathan did not claim FTB for the whole of the 2021-22 year as they lost care of Sam in June 2021. Sam comes back into Nathan's care on 1 July 2022 (exception for child coming into care does not apply as Sam was in Nathan's care during the consecutive years of zero entitlement).

Although Nathan was not eligible for FTB for the whole of 2021-22 due to not having an FTB child in their care, their confirmed ATI for 2021-22 (as assessed by the ATO) attracts entitlement on the basis of their current circumstances. This means that Nathan is excepted from non-entitlement from 1 July 2022.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AH Exception-resumption of eligibility for FTB

Special circumstances

Individuals may also be granted an exception if special circumstances exist in relation to them or their partner that did not exist at the end of the 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement that make it inappropriate to preclude payment of FTB A and/or FTB B based on an estimate. Special circumstances exceptions are not automatic and will be determined on a case by case basis as per the normal special circumstances considerations, but may include events such as becoming disaster affected.

2.8.4.10 ACCS (transition to work) - eligibility

Summary

This topic provides an overview of the eligibility requirements for

ACCS

(transition to work) which covers:

ACCS (transition to work)

additional 12 weeks.

ACCS (transition to work)

To be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must meet the eligibility requirements for

CCS

and specific ACCS (transition to work) eligibility requirements. An individual must meet the ACCS (transition to work) eligibility requirements at the start of the CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) to which a session of care (

1.1.S.40

) relates.

An individual is eligible for ACCS (transition to work) if they:

are in receipt of an eligible income support payment (

2.8.4.20

)

have a combined family income (

1.1.I.20

) less than the CCS lower income threshold (

1.1.I.70

)

have an active Job Plan (

1.1.J.20

) where required to have one

meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements (

2.8.4.40

)

have not exceeded the time limit for which ACCS (transition to work) can be paid for their activity/ies (

2.8.4.70

).

Part 2 Division 4 Transition to work

Additional 12 weeks

If an individual's income support payment reaches a nil rate as a result of employment, they may be eligible to receive ACCS (transition to work) for an additional 12 weeks (6 CCS fortnights) if they meet the eligibility requirements. An individual may be eligible for these additional 12 weeks during a nil rate period, even if their income exceeds the CCS lower income threshold during this time.

To be eligible for an additional 12 weeks of ACCS (transition to work) during an income support nil rate period, as a result of employment, the individual must have stopped receiving income support payment less than 12 weeks ago and meet all of the following requirements:

has been in receipt of ACCS (transition to work) in the fortnight prior to the commencement of the nil rate period (

3.1.12

)

has been in paid work in the fortnight the sessions of care are provided

did not cease to receive income support payment solely due to becoming a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) which resulted in the individual no longer being qualified for or meeting the income/assets test requirements.

1.1.S.25 Secondary earner (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

Part B, the secondary earner is the member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) who has the lower

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for an income year.

Where the ATI of the primary earner (

1.1.P.122

) is less than the FTB Part B income limit (

1.1.I.45

), the income test for FTB Part B is applied to the ATI of the secondary earner.

The term 'secondary earner' is also commonly referred to as 'lower income earner' (

1.1.L.40

).

3.1.3 Apportioning income test reductions between FTB Part A components

Apportioning

FTB

components

The components making up the maximum rate of FTB are reduced proportionately by the income test where an individual's

ATI

is above the income free area.

Explanation:

The maximum FTB rate, whether calculated using Method 1 or Method 2, is made up of components. The maximum rate is reduced by an individual's ATI above the income free area (

1.1.I.40

) or the higher income free area (

1.1.H.10

).

Note:

Past period claims made for a period in the current financial year and payments made by instalment are based on:

an estimate provided by the individual and assessed as reasonable by Centrelink, or

the indexed current estimate (most recent estimate of income available to Centrelink adjusted by movements in average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period), or

the indexed actual income (the previous year's taxable income as determined by the

ATO

and adjusted by movements in average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period).

The method of apportioning differs between Method 1 and Method 2 FTB rate calculations as under Method 1, only the above base rate components are reduced by the income test where income is below the higher income free area.

Note:

This topic only explains how the income test is apportioned between components of FTB Part A, it does not provide an explanation for how the FTB Part A rate is calculated under Method 1 and Method 2. When applying apportioning policy, it is assumed that the correct method of calculation is known.

Method 1

The rate is apportioned by working out the percentage of the difference between the FTB Part A maximum rate and the FTB Part A base rate that is made up of the components of FTB Part A (that is, the above base rate portion). Each above base rate component is reduced proportionately by the income test.

Example:

John receives FTB Part A for 2 children under 13 years. John also receives

RA

as a component of their FTB Part A because they pay private rent. As John's income is above the lower income threshold, their FTB Part A rate (including RA) is reduced under the income test. To determine how the income test reduction affects John's RA, work out the difference between their FTB Part A maximum rate and their FTB Part A base rate. This difference will be made up of RA and other applicable above base rate components of FTB Part A. Then work out the difference between John's FTB Part A income-tested rate and their FTB Part A base rate. RA, and the other applicable components, will constitute the same percentage of the difference between John's FTB Part A income-tested rate and John's FTB Part A base rate as they do the difference between John's FTB Part A maximum rate and John's FTB Part A base rate.

Explanation:

This means, if the RA component makes up 18% of the difference between the FTB Part A maximum rate and the FTB Part A base rate, it will also make up 18% of the difference between the applicable FTB Part A base rate and the new FTB Part A rate after income test reductions have been applied.

A more detailed way of calculating the apportioned rate under Method 1 is as follows:

Step

Action

1

Work out the difference between the maximum rate and the base rate of each component of FTB Part A. The sum of the results will give the above base rate portion of the total FTB Part A payment that is affected by the excess income. Excess income reduces each above base rate component proportionally. Note that for

NBS

,

MBA

and the FTB Part A supplement, the maximum and the base rate are the same, so the above base rate portion for these components is nil. For RA, there is no base rate, so the above base rate portion for RA is the maximum RA rate.

2

Work out the proportion of each above base rate component as a percentage of the total above base rate portion of the total FTB Part A payment.

3

Work out the reduction due to income by multiplying the difference between the family's ATI and the income free area by 0.2.

4

Multiply the amount from step 3 by the percentages calculated in step 2.

5

Reduce each above base rate component of step 1 according to the results of step 4.

Note:

The

ES

ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

Note:

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is only included where the combined ATI is equal to or less than $80,000.

Note:

If the excess income reduces FTB to base rate or below then only the base rate is paid.

Example:

On 1 July 2019, a couple has a newborn child, they are paying private rent of $400 per week and they have combined ATI of $55,000 per annum.

FTB Part A maximum standard rate = $4,854.50 per annum

FTB Part A base standard rate = $1,558.55 per annum

NBS higher annualised rate = $6,737.90 per annum

RA maximum rate = $4,201.15

RA base rate = $0

FTB Part A Supplement = $766.50

Income free area = $54,677

Step

Amount

1

FTB Part A maximum standard rate ($4,854.50) minus FTB base standard rate ($1,558.55) = $3,295.95

NBS maximum annualised rate ($6,737.90) minus base annualised rate ($6,737.90) = $0

RA maximum rate ($4,201.15) minus RA base rate ($0) = $4,201.15

FTB Part A supplement maximum rate ($766.50) minus FTB Part A supplement base rate ($766.50) = $0

Above base rate portion affected by the income test

$3,295.95 + $0 + $4,201.15 + $0 = $7,497.10

2

Above base rate FTB Part A standard rate

$3,295.95 ÷ $7,497.10 × 100 = 43.96%

Above base rate RA

$4,201.15 ÷ $7,497.10 × 100 = 56.04%

3

Reduction due to income

($55,000 − $54,677) × 0.2 = $64.60

4

FTB Part A standard rate

$64.60 × 43.96% = $28.40

RA

$64.60 × 56.04% = $36.20

5

FTB Part A income tested standard rate

$4,854.50 − $28.40 = $4,826.10

NBS income tested higher annualised rate = $6,493.35

RA income tested rate

$4,201.15 − $36.20 = $4,164.95

FTB Part A supplement income tested rate = $766.50

Total income tested FTB Part A rate

$4,826.10 + $6,493.35 + $4,164.95 + $766.50 = $16,250.90

Method 2

Under Method 2, each component is reduced proportionately by the income test.

Example:

John receives FTB Part A for 2 children under 13 years. As John's income is above the higher income free area, their FTB Part A payment rate is reduced under the income test. To determine how the income test reduction affects John's FTB Part A components, work out the proportion that each component represents in relation to their maximum rate. Then work out John's income tested rate. The applicable FTB Part A components will constitute the same percentage of the income tested rate and the maximum rate.

Explanation:

This means, if the standard Part A rate component makes up 88% of the maximum rate, it will also make up 88% of the income tested rate.

A more detailed way of calculating the apportioned rate under Method 2 is as follows:

Step

Action

1

Work out the proportion of each component of the base rate of FTB Part A as a percentage of the total maximum rate. Each component of the maximum total FTB Part A payment is affected by excess income. Excess income reduces each component proportionally.

2

Work out the reduction due to income by multiplying the difference between the family's ATI and the higher income free area by 0.3.

3

Multiply the amount from step 2 by the percentages calculated in step 1.

4

Reduce each component of the base rate of FTB Part A according to the results of step 3.

Example:

On 1 July 2019, a couple has a newborn child and they have a combined ATI of $99,500 per annum.

FTB Part A base standard rate = $1,558.55 per annum

NBS higher annualised rate = $6,737.90 per annum

Total Part A base rate (including NBS) = $8,296.45

Higher income free area = $98,988

Step

Amount

1

FTB Part A standard rate

$1,558.55 ÷ $8,296.45 × 100 = 18.79%

NBS

$6,737.90 ÷ $8,296.45 × 100 = 81.21%

2

Reduction due to income

($99,500 − $98,988) × 0.3 = $153.60

3

FTB Part A standard rate

$153.60 × 18.79% = $28.86

NBS

2.1.1.50 Determining percentage of care

Summary

This topic explains how to calculate the percentage of care (

1.1.P.76

) when 2 or more individuals (

1.1.I.90

) share the care of an

FTB

child and they have not provided Centrelink with an agreed percentage of care or there is disagreement over the percentage of care. The percentage of care is calculated taking into account the pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

) over the care period (

1.1.C.100

).

This topic includes the following:

alignment of care

the steps used to calculate a percentage of care, and

scenarios which show how to calculate the percentage of care following a variation to the pattern of care.

The processes of establishing the pattern of care, calculating the FTB shared care percentage and calculating the rate of FTB are covered in separate topics.

Alignment of care

As a result of legislative changes made by the

Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 2010

, from 1 July 2010 some rules relating to the determination of care percentages differ before and after this date.

From 1 July 2010, Child Support and Centrelink share care determinations where there is a child recognised in a child support assessment and a person receives FTB for the child. This means where a care percentage has been determined by Child Support, that determination will be aligned for the purpose of FA and will be applied in determining the individual's care percentage for FTB. Centrelink will not need to determine the care percentage unless there has been a change in the care arrangements and a new care determination is required. Child Support uses the same rules to verify shared care arrangements as Centrelink (

2.1.1.30

).

Before 1 July 2010, care determinations were not shared between Child Support and Centrelink. These changes do not affect care determinations made before 1 July 2010.

Any determination made before 1 July 2010 must be revoked and a new determination made in order for post 1 July 2010 alignment of care rules to apply.

Act reference:

Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 2010

item 101 Transitional-existing percentage of care under the Assessment Act, item 103 Transitional-change of care event, item 107 Transitional-existing percentage of care under the Family Assistance Act

Step 1 - Establish the pattern of care

The pattern of care to be used in the shared care determination is either the pattern agreed to by all carers of the child or, if there is no such agreement, the pattern of care as established by the decision maker for the care period. A care period is the period over which care is assessed to determine the care percentages for each carer. A care period begins on the day on which the care of a child starts to be shared between 2 or more adults, or the day on which the pattern of care changes and ends when there is a subsequent change in care. It should be noted that a care period will generally be a 12-month period from the commencement of that level of care and the same level of care will be assumed to apply for subsequent 12-month periods, unless otherwise advised. A care period may be shorter than 12 months where the level of care is unsettled and changes on a regular basis.

Example:

Angus and Julie have agreed to a level of care for Claire on a 50/50 basis for the 4-month period from 1 November to 28 February. They have agreed to review this at the end of February, as Angus has extensive work engagements that may mean he will not be able to provide care at the same level. At the beginning of March, Angus and Julie agree that Julie will provide care of Claire for 65% of the nights in the period from 1 March to 31 October, and Angus for 35% for that period. Centrelink is advised during March of the new level of care. The care period from 1 November to 28 February based on the 50/50 shared care comes to an end and a new care period based on the new care percentages of 65% for Julie and 35% for Angus begins from March. These new care percentages will continue to apply until a further change is notified.

Example:

Julie and Ken have recently separated and are uncertain about the ongoing levels of care for their child, Joel, over the longer term. In the period immediately after separation, from June to November, Julie and Prue, Joel's grandmother, care for him equally. Julie, Prue and Ken all share care of Joel equally from December to February and Julie and Ken share care equally from March to May. Even though Julie has provided continuous care for a 12-month period there are 3 separate care periods because the proportion of care each person has provided has changed twice.

Depending on the circumstances, there may also be more than one care period operating simultaneously in relation to different children being cared for by the same carer.

Example:

Samantha shares care of her son John on a 50/50 basis with John's other parent Bruce and this is an arrangement that is assessed over ongoing 12-month periods to May each year. Samantha also shares care of her daughter Fiona with Fiona's other parent Karen. As Samantha and Karen have recently separated, their levels of care for Fiona are on a 50/50 basis for a trial 6-month period. Although these percentages are agreed between Samantha and Karen, the levels of care are variable, which they have indicated to Centrelink. As they separated on 15 February, their care period runs until 14 August. If no further advice is received from Samantha or Karen, Centrelink may decide to continue the care period from 15 August on an ongoing 12-month basis from then.

Care period for FTB assessments,

2.1.1.45

Establishing a pattern of care,

2.1.1.80

FTB in blended families

Step 2 - Work out the percentage of care

Having established the pattern of care during the care period, the number of nights in care (

1.1.N.15

) is divided by the number of days in the care period and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a percentage.

Example:

Colin's parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

) states that his daughter Anne is to stay with him during the Easter and mid-year school holidays, in addition to other regular care on an ongoing basis. Over the 12-month care period, Colin cares for Anne for 147 nights, which is divided by 365 and multiplied by 100 to get a care percentage of 40%. Colin is eligible for 35% of the standard FTB rate (

1.1.S.103

).

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.1.D.50

Day in care (FTB)

Step 3 - Rounding the percentage of care

From 1 July 2008, new rounding rules for care percentage took effect. For care below 50%, care level must be rounded down to the nearest whole number. However, for care levels of 50% and above, care percentage must be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Example:

Ken has care of his 2 children 127 nights a year with his ex-partner Michelle having care of the children the remaining 238 nights. Ken's percentage of care is determined to be 34.8% (127 ÷ 365 × 100) and Michelle's percentage is 65.2% (238 ÷ 365 × 100). As Ken's care percentage is below 50, his level of care is rounded down from 34.8% to 34% while Michelle's percentage is rounded up from 65.2% to 66%. This means Ken is not eligible to receive FTB (child related components) and Michelle receives 100% of the FTB payment.

If there are more than 2 carers and one of them has a level of care lower than 35% that person is deemed not to have an FTB child. Their share of care may be apportioned between the other carers who have at least 35% each provided all carers for the care period have been identified and included in determining care percentages. If there is another eligible carer who has not claimed, their share of entitlement cannot be apportioned.

Example:

Karen, Ben and Edith share the care of Tom. Karen has 40%, Ben has 36% and Edith has 24% actual care. Edith has less than 35% care of Tom and is therefore not entitled to receive FTB. However, as Edith has more than 14% care, Tom is considered her regular care child. As Karen and Ben each have more than 35% actual care, they are each entitled to FTB for Tom. To apportion the unclaimed 24% between Karen and Ben, use the following calculation method:

Karen's share of FTB = 40 ÷ 76 × 100 = 52.63 and rounded up to 53, where 40 is Karen's shared care and 76 is the total of Karen and Ben's share of care.

Ben's percentage is 36 ÷ 76 × 100 = 47.36 but rounded down to 47.

Note:

Apportioning of FTB where there is a carer who has less than 35% care does not affect the actual care determination. All carers will still have their care percentages assessed. For child support purposes, the information that is sent to Child Support will include care percentage information on all carers who have a child support assessment.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 25 Effect of an individual's percentage of care for a child being less than 35%

Step 4 - Calculating the rate

The percentage of care for each person for a care period is used to derive the FTB shared care percentage for that person. The FTB shared care percentage is then used to calculate the FTB shared care rate. As each carer's circumstances are different, the rate of FTB payable may differ even when they have the same percentage of care.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.1.30

Shared care rate for FTB,

3.1.1.31

Shared care rate calculation

Scenario 1 - Variation to pattern of care

Anna and Bill have a parenting plan (

1.1.P.21

) setting out the care arrangements for their 3 children, Alyce, Brian and Clara. Both Anna and Bill have claimed FTB instalments. The care period is the 12-month period starting 1 August, and the following percentages of care have been worked out based on the plan:

Anna's percentages

Alyce 40%

Brian 37%, and

Clara 50%.

Bill's percentages

Alyce 60%

Brian 63%, and

Clara 50%.

On 5 November Anna contacts Centrelink and advises that the pattern of care for Alyce and Clara has changed from 1 November. Anna gives details of the new arrangements. The new pattern of care is expected to continue indefinitely. Centrelink contacts Bill, and he confirms the arrangements notified by Anna. The levels of care for the new care period beginning from 1 November are:

Anna cares for

Alyce 197 nights, and

Clara 147 nights.

Bill cares for

Alyce 168 nights, and

Clara 218 nights.

The level of care for Brian has not changed.

The percentages of care for the new care period from 1 November to 31 October are worked out as follows:

Anna's percentages

Alyce = 54% (197 ÷ 365 × 100)

Brian = no change, and

Clara = 40% (147 ÷ 365 × 100).

Bill's percentages

Alyce = 46% (168 ÷ 365 × 100)

Brian = no change, and

Clara = 60% (218 ÷ 365 × 100).

The care percentages are applied until a subsequent change in care is reported.

Scenario 2 - Variation to pattern of care

Allan and Beth do not have a parenting plan or agreed percentages of care regarding the care of their children Ashley and Carol. Their pattern of care was assessed on the basis of the care arrangements they both advised. Both Allan and Beth have been receiving instalments of FTB. Allan advises that their levels of care have changed to the following:

Allan's arrangements

Ashley 3 nights per week, and

Carol 4 nights per week.

Beth's arrangements

Ashley 4 nights per week, and

Carol 3 nights per week.

Beth agrees that this arrangement is ongoing. The percentages of care for the new care period are worked out as follows:

Allan's arrangements

Ashley = 156 nights (365 ÷ 7 × 3), and

Carol = 209 nights (365 ÷ 7 × 4).

Beth's arrangements

Ashley = 209 nights (365 ÷ 7 × 4), and

Carol = 156 nights (365 ÷ 7 × 3).

The percentages of care for the new 12-month care period are worked out as follows:

Allan's percentages

Ashley = 42% (156 ÷ 365 × 100), and

Carol = 58% (209 ÷ 365 × 100).

Beth's percentages

Ashley = 58% (209 ÷ 365 × 100), and

Carol = 42% (156 ÷ 365 × 100).

Changes of care that do not affect entitlement

Whether Centrelink revokes an existing care percentage determination will depend on the circumstances of the case. An individual may advise Centrelink about a change of care that would not affect their FTB shared care percentage, but they still wish to have the change reflected on their Centrelink record. In these circumstances, Centrelink should revoke the existing care percentage determination if there is evidence provided by each party, or evidence which is otherwise readily available, to determine new care percentages. This helps to ensure there is an accurate record of the care history. However, if a party to the shared care arrangement does not agree that a change has occurred or the readily available evidence is otherwise not conclusive as to the precise care percentages, Centrelink may decide not to revoke the existing determination and conduct no further investigations. This discretion enables Centrelink to decide to not proceed with unnecessary investigations to determine precise care percentages that would not make a material difference to an individual's FTB entitlement.

Example:

Emily and Emma have one child, Charles, for whom Emily has 8% care and Emma has 92% care. Emily calls Centrelink to advise that her care percentage of Charles has increased from 8% to 12% care. Centrelink explains that this change, if confirmed, will not affect the amount of FTB payable (it will still be nil). Emma advises there has been no change in care and Emily is unable to produce any evidence that would substantiate the claimed change of care. Centrelink decides not to conduct further investigations, and makes a decision to not revoke the existing care percentage determination.

Example:

Kerryn and Shane have one child, Mel, for whom Kerryn has 14% care and Shane has 86% care. Kerryn calls Centrelink to advise that her care percentage for Mel has increased from 14% care to 25% care. Centrelink contacts the other parent, Shane, who confirms that Kerryn's care of Mel has increased from 14% care to 25% care. Even though Kerryn's increased level of care for Mel will not affect the FTB payment, Centrelink is satisfied that Kerryn's new care percentage for Mel is 25% and decides to revoke the existing care percentage to enable a new care percentage determination to be made that reflects Kerryn's 25% care of Mel.

4.4.5.10 Failure to provide information - general provisions

Failure to provide requested information

Under FA(Admin)Act section 29, the Secretary may decide that an individual has no entitlement to

FTB

if they fail to provide information or produce documents as required by the Secretary within a specified period. This means the individual's FTB entitlement may be cancelled. The date of effect of the cancellation is the day after the end of the individual's latest entitlement period.

Individual subsequently provides information

Where the individual provides the information before the end of the income year following the income year in which the cancellation took effect, Centrelink must vary the decision to cancel FTB. The date of effect of this variation is the date of the original cancellation decision. The variation reinstates the determination that applied before the cancellation.

Example 1:

John failed to provide requested information to Centrelink. FTB entitlement was cancelled on 30 September (income year 1). He provides the requested information to Centrelink on 1 October (income year 2). As John provided the requested information before the end of income year 2, ending 30 June, his FTB entitlement is reinstated from 30 September (income year 1).

Example 2:

Kerry failed to provide requested information to Centrelink. As a result, Kerry's FTB entitlement was cancelled on 30 September (income year 1). Kerry then provides the requested information to Centrelink on 1 October (income year 3). As Kerry did not provide the requested information before the end of income year 2, her FTB entitlement can only be adjusted from the beginning of income year 2.

Note:

Example 2 only applies to beneficial variations.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 29 Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to provide information, section 154 General power to obtain information, section 158 Written notice of requirement

Information provided voluntarily

Where Centrelink specifies that the request for information is voluntary, the individual's FTB entitlement cannot be cancelled if the individual does not provide the information.

1.4.5 Act of grace payments

What is an act of grace payment?

An act of grace payment is generally a remedy of last resort to pay an amount to a claimant where it is appropriate to do so, but the

FA

law would not enable payment. It is not used when there is another viable remedy available to provide redress in the circumstances giving rise to the application.

The criteria for act of grace payments are set out in the Department of Finance's

Resource Management Guide No. 401

.

The Finance Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, authorise one or more payments to be made to a person if the Finance Minister considers it appropriate to do so because of special circumstances.

Examples of special circumstances that may make it appropriate to approve an act of grace payment include instances when:

an act of Centrelink has caused an unintended and inequitable result to the individual seeking the payment

the application of the legislation or policy produces unintended, anomalous, inequitable, or an otherwise unacceptable impact on the claimant's circumstances, and those circumstances were

specific to the individual seeking the payment

outside the parameters of events for which the individual seeking the payment was responsible or had the capacity to adequately control

consistent with what could be considered to be the broad intention of the relevant legislation

the matter is not covered by legislation or specific policy, but the Australian Government intends to introduce such legislation or policy and it is considered desirable in a particular case to apply the benefits of the relevant policy prospectively.

Only the Minister for Finance, or a delegate within the Department of Finance, can authorise an act of grace payment. Centrelink can only make proposals in relation to act of grace payments as Centrelink has no authority to approve act of grace payments.

2.8.1.60 ACCS (child wellbeing) - giving notice

Summary

This topic describes circumstances in which an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) is required to give notice to an appropriate state or territory body (

1.1.A.75

) in relation to a child 'at risk' (

1.1.A.110

). This is also known as making a child wellbeing referral.

Giving notice

The approved provider must meet the ‘giving notice’ requirement (

1.1.G.13

) when they give a certificate (

1.1.C.15

) or apply for the initial determination (

1.1.D.78

) for a child. The provider only needs to give notice once in relation to a child.

This means that an approved provider must give notice to an appropriate state or territory body in relation to the child:

within 6 weeks from an

ACCS

(child wellbeing) certificate coming into effect

on the date an ACCS (child wellbeing) certificate comes into effect if it was backdated more than 28 days, or

before applying to Centrelink for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination.

An appropriate body is:

a state or territory department or agency that deals with matters relating to child welfare, or

an organisation that deals with such matters on behalf of a department or agency.

The provider should choose an appropriate state or territory body that is relevant to the family’s circumstances. For example, a family experiencing homelessness may benefit from a referral to an organisation responsible for public housing services.

The approved provider does not need to give notice if:

they already gave notice to an appropriate state or territory body in relation to the child less than 6 weeks ago, or

they were advised of the risk to the child by an appropriate state or territory agency.

The approved provider does not need to remain in contact with the appropriate state or territory body once they have made the referral.

Giving notice to an appropriate state or territory agency is a requirement under Family Assistance Law. It does not remove any mandatory reporting obligations required by the approved provider's state or territory government.

3.1.4.10 Method 1 - calculating the maximum rate of FTB Part A

Summary

This topic provides information about calculating the rate of

FTB

Part A using Method 1 of the FTB rate calculator.

When to use Method 1

Method 1 for calculating the maximum rate (

1.1.M.26

) of FTB Part A applies when a family's

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is less than the income free area, or greater than the income free area and equal to or less than the higher income free area (

1.1.H.10

). Their maximum rate of FTB Part A is reduced by 20% of the income excess above the income free area. Where the family's rate is calculated using Method 1 under Step 3 of the Method 2 income test for comparison purposes, a rate reduction of 30% of the income excess above the higher income free area applies.

The income-tested rate of Method 1 cannot go below the base rate of FTB payable.

Components of maximum rate of FTB Part A using Method 1

The components are:

rent assistance.

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is only included in Method 1 calculations where the combined ATI is less than or equal to $80,000 for the relevant income year.

From 20 March 2017 ES ceased for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. Therefore, ES will only be included in Method 1 calculations for grandfathered individuals. See

4.13.1 CCS enrolment notices

Requirement to submit enrolment notices

Approved providers (

1.1.A.90

) must submit an enrolment notice (

1.1.E.25

) in the

CCSS

to indicate they have entered into an arrangement with an individual (

1.1.I.90

) for a child enrolled under their care. The enrolment notice must reflect the type of arrangement that is in place between the provider and the individual and contain information about the child and individual (for example, name,

CRN

,

DOB

etc.) and the pattern of care and usual fees as per the arrangement.

Where a provider identifies that a child is at risk of serious abuse/neglect but there is no eligible individual, an enrolment notice must still be submitted.

Enrolment notices should also be submitted where the provider enters into an arrangement with an organisation, for example, where a parent's (

1.1.P.10

) employer is paying for the full cost of an individual's child care fees.

Session reports (

1.1.S.35

) must be submitted for all children for whom an enrolment notice has been provided.

Timeframe for submitting enrolment notices

An initial enrolment notice must be submitted within 7 days from either:

the end of the week in which the provider and individual entered into an arrangement

the provider or service being approved (if after the start of the arrangement or attendance), or

the end of a suspension of service (if an approved service has been suspended by the Department of Education and the enrolment occurs during the period of suspension).

Requirement to update enrolment notices

Providers must update an enrolment notice if:

the individual disagrees with detail/s of an enrolment, and the provider agrees an update is required

an arrangement for care is varied, at the request or in discussion with the individual (and this has been reflected in the

CWA

)

the provider becomes aware the information originally provided in an enrolment is (or becomes) incorrect, whether at the time of or after the enrolment notice was created

the arrangement for care ends. Note that if the enrolment notice included an arrangement end date (which is not mandatory) and the arrangement ends on that date, no update is needed.

An enrolment must be updated within 7 days of the change or event to which the update relates.

6.4.4.10 Reconciliation - current partners

Summary

This topic discusses the treatment of current partners (

1.1.P.30

) in the reconciliation process. It details:

the impact of a current partner on the timing of reconciliation

the impact of one partner not lodging an income tax return, and

the assessment of

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for periods when the individual (

1.1.I.90

) was partnered.

A current partner for the purposes of reconciliation is a person with whom the individual was partnered for part of, or for the entire claim period, during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) and with whom they were still partnered on 30 June of that year (or for

CCS

, still partnered on the last day of the CCS year).

Impact of a current partner on the timing of reconciliation

For

FTB

and CCS, if both the individual and their current/relevant partner/s are not required to lodge a tax return for an income year, reconciliation can occur immediately following the end of the relevant income year provided all the other conditions for reconciliation are met. For reconciliation to occur in these circumstances, the individual must notify Centrelink of their combined ATI.

If the individual and/or their current partner are required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year, reconciliation can only occur after their income tax return/s have been lodged and all the other conditions for reconciliation are met.

Example:

Rachel is receiving FTB and CCS and is partnered to Steve throughout the relevant income year. Both are required to lodge income tax returns. Steve lodges an income tax return for the relevant income year by 1 October of the lodgement year, and actual maintenance income and child-care usage are available at that time. Rachel has not yet lodged an income tax return. No reconciliation of Rachel's FTB and/or CCS entitlement can be carried out until Rachel lodges an income tax return for the relevant income year.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.1.30

Reconciliation process,

6.4.3.10

Valid reasons for not lodging a tax return

FTB reconciliation conditions not met by March/April of lodgement year

An individual will be subject to the FTB non-lodger (

1.1.N.33

) notice process if they and/or their partner have not lodged an income tax return for the relevant income year, or notified Centrelink of their combined ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year, by March/April of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

).

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.3

Requirement to lodge an income tax return

CCS reconciliation conditions not met

An individual fails to meet the reconciliation conditions by not lodging a tax return or, where they are not required to lodge a tax return, by not notifying Centrelink of their ATI. These obligations also apply to any partner of a claimant during that income year.

The first deadline by which reconciliation conditions must be met is one year after the end of the income year in which CCS entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) was determined - that is, by 30 June of the first income year after the relevant income year. If reconciliation conditions have not been met by the first deadline, a determination of no entitlement (that is, no CCS payments) will be made until the individual meets the reconciliation conditions.

If an individual meets the reconciliation conditions after the first deadline but before the second deadline, their CCS entitlement will resume from the week in which reconciliation conditions were met.

The second deadline is 2 years after the end of the income year in which CCS entitlement was determined. If reconciliation conditions have not been met by the second deadline, the family’s CCS eligibility is cancelled, and debt recovery will commence for the subsidy that was paid in relation to the CCS year (that is, all CCS fortnights (

1.1.C.10

) that start in the income year).

Loss of eligibility for CCS will also result in a loss of eligibility for

ACCS

, if applicable. In order to regain eligibility and entitlement to CCS and/or ACCS, the individual will need to ensure they meet reconciliation conditions for all income years in which CCS entitlement was determined, before they will be able to make a new effective claim for CCS.

Example:

Jo received CCS in the 2018-19 income year. She was partnered with Tom for the whole income year. Jo lodges a return by 1 October 2019, Tom lodges a tax return in April 2020. Jo's entitlements can now be reconciled and she continues to receive CCS.

Example:

Trish received CCS in the 2018-19 income year. She was partnered with Clive for the whole income year. Trish and Clive fail to lodge tax returns for 2018-19 by July 2020 (the first deadline). Trish loses her entitlement to CCS, so no CCS payments are made to her approved provider on her behalf from 1 July 2020 onwards. Trish and Clive lodge their tax returns on 23 July 2020. Trish starts receiving CCS entitlement from the week in which she met the reconciliation conditions and is not entitled to any subsidy for the period 1 to 22 July 2020.

Assessment of ATI

For individuals with a current partner or an ex-partner, assessment of their

FA

entitlement is carried out by including:

only the individual's ATI for any period they were single, and

both the individual's and partner's ATI for any period they were a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

).

Example:

Gayle receives FTB for the whole of the last income year. She is partnered to Gordon for the period 1 July to 30 September, single for the period 1 October to 31 December, and partnered to Brian for the period 1 January to 30 June. Gayle's actual ATI for this year is $10,000, Gordon's income is $20,000 and Brian's income is $8,000. The ATI for Gayle's FTB for each period is as follows.

1.1.M.26 Maximum rate (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

Part A, the maximum rate of FTB is worked out using the appropriate rate calculation method. A higher standard rate applies for Method 1 compared to Method 2 or

Method 3.

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is only included in Method 1 or Method 2 calculations where the combined

ATI

is equal to or less than $80,000 for the relevant income year.

The

ES

ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. Therefore, ES will only be included in Method 1 or Method 2 calculations for grandfathered individuals. See

8.2

.

Method 1

Using Method 1 to calculate the rate of FTB Part A, the components of the maximum rate are:

standard rate (

1.1.S.103

), plus

newborn supplement, plus

multiple birth allowance, plus

ES Part A, plus

FTB Part A supplement, plus

rent assistance.

The income test and the maintenance income test are applied to the maximum rate to calculate an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) rate of FTB Part A. If a family's ATI is more than the income free area (

1.1.I.40

), but less than or equal to the higher income free area (

1.1.H.10

), their maximum rate of FTB part A is reduced by 20% of the income excess.

Schedule 1 clause 3 Method of calculating Part A rate

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.4

FTB Part A rate calculation - Method 1,

Method 2

Using Method 2, the components of the maximum rate are:

standard rate for Method 2, plus

newborn supplement, plus

multiple birth allowance, plus

ES Part A for Method 2, plus

FTB Part A supplement.

A lower standard rate applies for Method 2 compared to Method 1. The income test is applied to the maximum rate to calculate an individual's rate of FTB Part A. If a family's ATI is more than the higher income free area, their maximum rate of FTB part A is reduced by 30% of the income excess above the higher income free area. This applies both when the family's rate is calculated using Method 2 and when it is calculated using Method 1 under Step 3 of the Method 2 income test.

The maintenance income test is not applied when the rate is worked out using Method 2.

Method 3

Method 3 applies where a person shares the care of a child with another person, other than their partner, and their share of care is more than 14% but less than 35% and has no other FTB children. The components of the maximum rate are:

rent assistance.

The income test applied under Method 3 is the same as Method 1, however the maintenance income test is not applied and there is no comparison with the base rate because they are not eligible for FTB Part A.

2.1.1.30 Verification of shared care arrangements

Summary

Actual care arrangements must be verified with all carers, if possible. This applies to instalment claims for

FTB

(

1.1.I.100

) and past period claims for FTB lodged with Centrelink, where the care of an FTB child is shared, or where a change of care has occurred. This applies even when one of the carers is not an FTB individual, as the care determination may impact on their child support assessment.

Note:

From 1 July 2010, determination of care percentage that is determined by either Centrelink for

FA

purposes or Child Support for child support purposes will be aligned to the other agency in relation to a relevant care period. This means where there has been a care determination made by Child Support, this determination will be used by Centrelink to assess eligibility for, and the rate of, FTB. Centrelink will only be able to make a new care determination if there has been a change in the care arrangements. Child Support uses the same rules as Centrelink to verify care arrangements.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.60

Change of care of an FTB child,

2.1.1.80

FTB in blended families,

2.1.1.85

Formal & informal care of an FTB child

Verification of shared care

Verification of shared care involves establishing that all parties caring for the child agree on either their shared care percentages or the actual pattern of care. If agreement is reached, no further verification is necessary. If they do not agree, further verification is required - with all carers, if possible.

Formal arrangement exists

Where a formal care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

) exists and all parties agree to it there is no need to verify the arrangement. A care arrangement may be documented in the following:

a written agreement

a family law order (

1.1.F.10

)

parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

) or order (

1.1.P.19

), or

custody order (

1.1.C.70

).

If the parties do not agree on what the care arrangements are, further verification is required in order to determine the actual care arrangements. Obtaining a copy of the document detailing a care arrangement is one means of verification that may be used, but verification of actual care is also required. Some specific examples of care arrangement may include a foster care placement, or a court order for graduated return to care where a child is being integrated back into the family.

Additional evidence when there is disagreement about care arrangements

If there is disagreement between carers as to what the care arrangements for a child are, it is important that all carers of a child have the opportunity to provide verification of care. Each person should be asked to provide additional evidence to support their declared arrangements.

Disagreements about care are also relevant even where a care arrangement exists, as the percentage of care is generally assessed on the basis of actual care. For example, this could be relevant where the terms of a parenting plan are not being complied with by one of the parties.

Example:

Steve and Joan have a parenting plan for the care of their child Sandy. The plan provides that Steve has 35% care and Joan 65% care. Joan contacts Centrelink to advise that Steve has failed to provide any care for Sandy for the last 2 months and that he has no intention of exercising his rights under the plan. Centrelink contacts Steve, who agrees that he has had no contact with Sandy for the last 2 months, but intends to do so in the future. Upon investigation, Centrelink establishes that despite numerous requests from Joan for Steve to exercise his care of Sandy at the times specified in the plan, Steve has refused to do so and this has been verified from a number of sources. On this basis, Centrelink assesses that Joan has 100% care of Sandy and Steve 0%, with a date of effect for the care period (

1.1.C.100

) from when Steve stopped exercising his care of Sandy, which was 2 months ago.

When assessing actual care percentages, evidence may be obtained from a range of sources.

Example:

Evidence provided by the individual may include:

written agreement

family law order or parenting plan

confirmation of play group, kindergarten or school enrolment

proof of attendance or membership of local organisations or activities

receipts for expenses incurred while the child was in care

confirmation of the level of care from close family friends or relatives

confirmation from professional members of the community who have regular contact with the family, such as teachers, police, ministers of religion, accountants, lawyers or doctors

social worker reports, especially in cases where there may be a fear of violence if the other parent is contacted

proof of travel arrangements at contact times (for example, rail or airline tickets), and

records from Centrelink or other government agencies which may confirm present or previous patterns of care, such as information about past shared caring arrangements which may be relevant to the current situation, particularly where an existing care determination was made by Child Support and at least one of the parties is stating that the care arrangements have changed.

Centrelink must not attempt to obtain verification of care arrangements from the child.

If Centrelink makes a new care determination based on changed care arrangements, the individual can seek review of this decision by Centrelink (

6.2

).

Act reference:

FAAct

section 35T Percentages of care determined under the child support law that apply for family assistance purposes, section 35U Reviews of percentages of care under child support law apply for family assistance purposes

Verification of change of care arrangements required when a new carer claims FTB

When a new carer claims FTB, and Centrelink has not been notified of the change by the previous carer or Child Support, Centrelink should confirm the situation with the previous carer. Documentation to prove care arrangements is to be sighted for both instalment and past period claimants.

If the previous carer does not respond to a request for confirmation within 14 days, the new carer's claim can proceed based on the evidence provided by them. It should be explained to the individual that the other carer may claim FTB later. If there is a dispute about the care arrangements at that time, a review may be undertaken and Centrelink may have to recover any FTB that should not have been paid.

2.6.2.20 CCS - Australian residency exceptions

Australian residency exceptions

The following table shows the circumstances when an individual (

1.1.I.90

) who is not an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

) may still be eligible for

CCS

.

Exception circumstance

More detail

The person holds an

SCV

.

All SCV holders residing in Australia are eligible - it is not necessary to be a 'protected SCV holder'.

The person holds a subclass of visa determined by the Minister and the person is:

in Australia (

1.1.A.120

), or

temporarily absent from Australia (

1.1.A.10

) for 6 weeks or less and the absence (

1.1.A.05

) is an allowable absence in relation to

SpB

under SSAct Part 4.2.

Note:

The following visa subclasses generally have a visa travel facility that would enable the holder to be temporarily absent from Australia:

subclass 309 Partner (Provisional)

subclass 820 Partner

subclass 785 (class XD) Temporary Protection*

subclass 790 Safe Haven Enterprise*.

The following visa subclasses have been determined by the Minister:

subclass 820 Partner

subclass 309 Partner (Provisional)

subclass 785 Temporary Protection

subclass 786 Temporary (Humanitarian Concern)

subclass ZB 951 Criminal Justice Stay Visa (if the CJSV has been issued only for the purpose of assisting in the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence of trafficking in persons, slavery or slavery-like practices)

subclass 790 Safe Haven Enterprise*

subclass 060 Bridging F

subclass 070 Bridging (Removal Pending), and

subclass 449 Humanitarian Stay (Temporary).

Note:

The

CJSV

is no longer issued for the purpose of assisting in the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence of trafficking in persons, slavery or slavery-like practices.

The individual is the holder of a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403), and the person is:

a worker in the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme who has been approved to bring family members to Australia, or

the family member of such a worker.

Workers participating in the PALM scheme who hold a subclass 403 visa and are approved to bring family members to Australia, and family members of these worker, may be eligible for FTB, subject to meeting all other eligibility criteria.

A person is an eligible family member of a PALM worker if they were granted a subclass 403 visa on the basis that they are a member of the PALM worker’s family unit within the meaning of the

Migration Act 1958

. This includes:

a spouse or de facto partner

a child or step-child who is aged up to 18, or who is aged 18 to 23 and is dependent on the PALM worker or their spouse or de facto partner, or who has turned 23 and is dependent on the PALM worker or their spouse or de facto partner due to being incapacitated, and

any dependent child of a child or step-child as described above.

Note:

Subclass 403 visa holders granted under other streams of this visa are not eligible for CCS.

The person is undertaking a course of study in Australia for which they receive direct financial assistance from the Commonwealth.

Example:

AusAID scholarship (if receiving direct financial assistance) or Endeavour Award.

This does not include students on a university scholarship indirectly funded by the Commonwealth.

The person is taken to be an Australian resident because:

hardship would be caused if the individual were not treated as an Australian resident, or

special circumstances exist.

This is a discretionary decision.

Hardship may be caused by a traumatic event such as:

the applicant's partner (

1.1.P.30

) dying

the applicant separating from their partner, or

the applicant, or their partner, becoming hospitalised or disabled.

In each circumstance you should consider:

how recently the event occurred

whether the event was foreseeable, and

the ongoing effect on the family.

*Subject to approval from the Department of Home Affairs, a subclass 785 (class XD) or 790 visa holder may be eligible to travel overseas and re-enter Australia where the holder can demonstrate compassionate or compelling circumstances.

4.7.3 CCS & ACCS emergency absences

Summary

When a

CCS

period of emergency (

1.1.P.78

) is declared, emergency absences are available to families. Emergency absences are extra allowable absences (

4.7.1

) and do not use the family’s annual allocation of 42 allowable absences.

These absences will be automatically applied in the

CCSS

when a CCS period of emergency is declared.

The absence must be on or after 23 February 2022 and directly related to the CCS period of emergency. For example, where the service has to close due to flooding or staff are unable to attend the service because of road closures. Emergency absences also cover circumstances where a child cannot attend as a direct result of the emergency.

4.3.1.30 Mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB instalments

Summary

Individuals who receive

FTB

by instalment and who advise of a change in their

ATI

estimate, or have their FTB estimate automatically uplifted by Centrelink during the year, may have their FTB rate automatically adjusted to reduce the risk of an overpayment at the end of the income year. This process is known as mandatory continuous adjustment (MCA).

MCA's objective is to reduce the potential for future FTB reconciliation debt by applying an adjustment process to the rate of FTB instalment payments for individuals who have a revision to their family's income/maintenance estimate (including the second automatic uplift) during the entitlement year.

The individual's daily rate of FTB is calculated on the basis of the new estimate for the remainder of the income year. If there is a notional overpayment, a deduction is made from the individual's daily rate to take account of the notional overpayment of FTB based on the previous income estimate.

Note:

The notional overpayment is not a debt and therefore debt recovery provisions do not apply.

Individuals will still be required to advise of changes to their income estimate, as currently applies. Any future increase or decrease in an individual's income estimate during the income year requires a new calculation of the adjustment to the daily rate of FTB for the remainder of the income year.

Note:

There are no hardship exemptions for individuals whose FTB rate is automatically adjusted.

Income changes

Revised income/maintenance estimate/s include:

individual's revised estimate of their ATI

individual's revised maintenance income estimate

an indexed income estimate for the individual

an indexed actual income for the individual

system triggered maintenance income revision (for example, disbursement method).

Note:

Individual's income and maintenance estimates are to be read as income and maintenance estimates for the claimant and partner, if there is one.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.4.2.20

Change in income related circumstances

MCA method

Where individuals who receive FTB by instalment have a revised income/maintenance estimate in the entitlement year, the system will apply the following process to calculate any possible daily overpayment amount.

Method statement

Step

Action

1

Work out the total amount of FTB the individual was entitled to be paid during the period beginning at the start of the income year and ending when the new estimate begins.

2

Work out the total amount of FTB the individual would have been entitled to be paid during that period if the individual's rate of FTB were calculated using the new estimate.

3

Take the amount worked out at step 2 away from the amount worked out at step 1.

Once any notional overpayment is determined at Step 3 the following 2 steps will be used to calculate the individuals' daily overpayment rate.

4

If the amount worked out at step 3 is greater than zero, work out the number of days remaining in the income year starting from the date of the new estimate.

5

Work out the daily overpayment rate by dividing the amount worked out at step 3 by the number of days worked out at step 4.

Example:

Sean and Emily have a family with 2 children, aged 2 and 6. Sean's income estimate is $45,000 and Emily's is $0, making a combined income estimate of $45,000 for the 2012-13 income year. On 7 April they notify Centrelink that Sean has received a pay rise therefore their estimated family income will increase to $48,500.

Step

Action

1

Calculate the amount of their FTB entitlement for the period 1 July 2012 to 6 April 2013 (280 days) based on their original income estimate of $45,000.

FTB Part A rate = $8,847.60

FTB Part B rate = $3,763.15

Total annual FTB rate = $12,610.75

Daily rate of FTB = $12,610.75 ÷ 365 days = $34.55

Total amount of FTB for the period 1 July to 6 April = $34.55 × 280 days = $9,674.00

2

Calculate the amount of FTB Sean and Emily would have been entitled to be paid for the period 1 July 2012 to 6 April 2013 (280 days) based on their new income estimate of $48,500.

Family income ($48,500.00) - FTB low income threshold ($47,815.00) = $685.00 × 0.2 = $137.00

FTB Part A entitlement amount $8,847.60 - FTB Part A rate reduction amount $137.00 = $8,710.60

FTB Part A rate = $8,710.60

FTB Part B rate = $3,763.15

Total annual FTB rate = $12.473.75

Daily rate of FTB = $12,473.75 ÷ 365 days = $34.17

Amount of FTB entitlement based on new income estimate = $34.17 × 280 days = $9,567.60

3

Calculate the notional overpayment by taking the amount of FTB they were entitled to be paid based on their original income estimate (Step 1) from the amount they are entitled to receive based on their revised estimate (Step 2) for the period 1 July 2012 to 6 April 2013.

$9,674.00 - $9,567.60 = $106.40 (indicating a notional overpayment)

4

Work out the number of days remaining in the income year (365 - 280 = 85 days).

5

Work out Sean and Emily's daily overpayment rate by dividing the notional overpayment amount (Step 3) by the number of days remaining in the income year (Step 4).

$106.40 ÷ 85 days = $1.25

Sean and Emily's daily rate of FTB for the remainder of the income year based on their revised income estimate should be reduced by the daily overpayment rate in Step 5.

Adjusted daily rate of FTB for remainder of income year = $34.17 - $1.25 = $32.92

If Sean and Emily revise their income estimate again later in the income year a new calculation will be required of the adjustment to their daily rate of FTB.

If there is a change in circumstances affecting the individual's daily rate in the period before the new estimate is provided, calculation of the adjustment must reflect the change in circumstances.

Where MCA has been applied to an individual, any subsequent MCA assessments will take this into account.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 31E Continuous adjustment of daily rate of FTB

Maintenance income

If an individual receives maintenance income that affects their FTB Part A, the MCA calculation will also be applied to their daily FTB rate if their maintenance income changes during the entitlement year. Any change in maintenance income requires a new calculation of the adjustment to the individual's daily rate of FTB for the remainder of the entitlement year. MCA may also be triggered where the Secretary makes a revised estimate of maintenance income.

MIC

rules do not impact on the MCA calculation process.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.1.M.10

Maintenance (FTB),

3.1.7.05

Maintenance income credit

Change of circumstance

The MCA process will only be applied for reasons of a non-circumstance related income/maintenance estimate revision. The revision does not have to result in a change to the claimant's legislative rate. A change in circumstances that would normally be followed by a revised estimate is generally not sufficient to trigger MCA in itself. For example, where an individual becomes partnered and their record becomes linked to another person's, the individual's income details are automatically updated. For the purposes of MCA, this automatic update after becoming partnered should not be considered a revised estimate. The individual must provide Centrelink with a revised estimate of their own income in order for MCA to apply.

However, if an individual already has an MCA daily overpayment amount being deducted from their ongoing rate and they advise of a change of circumstances that occurred earlier in the financial year, the MCA assessment will be recalculated under Secretary initiated review provisions to ensure the correct daily overpayment rate is applied.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.4.2.10

Change in non-income related circumstances

Payment of arrears

If an individual has their entitlement recalculated and they are found to have an amount owing, in general this arrears payment remains unaffected by MCA. However, if the arrears relate to a period where the individual has MCA applied to their FTB rate and the MCA amount has been under-recovered, the arrears can be used to balance the short fall of the notional overpayment for that period.

Arrears that are generated in respect of a period entirely unrelated to MCA impact cannot be used in this manner.

Break in entitlement/restoration of entitlement

Following an MCA assessment that results in a daily overpayment rate, if there is a break in the individuals' entitlement, but at a later date the FTB is restored (within the same financial year), MCA will still apply to the individual's rate and any amount of arrears, as well as ongoing payments, will reflect the previous MCA deduction.

Similarly, if an individual cancels their entitlement and this had an MCA applied at the time and the individual then makes a new claim for FTB (within the same financial year) the MCA deduction will continue relating to the new claim and affect the new entitlement amount, even if this is the same income amount as per the previous claim. Any arrears paid representing the past period falling wholly in that entitlement year will also have the appropriate MCA amount deducted from them.

Bereavement

The presence of a bereavement period will not exclude the MCA process. MCA applies as follows.

If the deceased child was not the last eligible FTB child, any new MCA assessment or any ongoing deduction will be applied against the individuals FTB ongoing instalment payment. If the individual chooses to take lump sum payment for the bereavement portion, this will not be reduced by MCA.

If the deceased child was the last FTB qualifying child, then the MCA deduction will apply to the lump sum or ongoing FTB payment.

FTB advances

The MCA of an individual's FTB payment may be impacted by the receipt or repayment of an FTB advance.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.2.8.10

FTB advance payments - details

Payment delivery options

Where an individual chooses to defer part of their annual FTB entitlement under a payment delivery option (

4.3.1.10

) they are still subject to MCA. In these cases, the MCA method statement will have regard to the individual's legislative rate of FTB, rather than what they are receiving when assessing whether there is a notional overpayment.

7.7.2 Departure authorisation certificates

Summary

Where a

DPO

is in force, an individual can apply for the issue of a

DAC

. A DAC allows the debtor to depart Australia, for a defined period, despite a DPO being in force.

Issuing a DAC

The Secretary must issue a DAC in situations where:

a debtor is likely to depart and return to Australia within a specified period, revocation of the DPO is likely within a time period that the Secretary considers appropriate, and security for the debtor's return to Australia is not necessary

a DAC is to be issued as the debtor has provided appropriate security for their return to Australia by a specified date, or

the debtor is unable to provide appropriate security for their return to Australia, however a DAC is to be issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia's interests.

There is no discretion to issue a DAC in other situations.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102G Application for departure authorisation certificate, section 102H When Secretary must issue departure authorisation certificate, section 102U Production of authority to depart

DAC issued where security provided

The Secretary must issue a DAC when the individual has given appropriate security for their return to Australia. The individual can provide the security by deposit or by other means. If they do not return to Australia by the agreed date, the security will be forfeited to the Commonwealth. It cannot be applied against the outstanding debts.

The Secretary will only accept a security that is:

in a form that is readily convertible to cash, such as a bank cheque

offered by the individual rather than third parties on the individual's behalf, or

generally not significantly less in value than the amount of the debts owing.

Note:

Security arising from a loan is not accepted.

Where an individual is able to give appropriate security, it is preferable to use these funds to reduce these debts than to use these funds as security, as this will usually justify revoking the DPO. Offering security may be an appropriate alternative to reducing the debts when the debts are in dispute and the individual is taking steps to resolve this dispute.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102J Security for person's return to Australia

DAC issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia's interests

The Secretary must also issue a DAC where satisfied that:

the certificate should be issued on humanitarian grounds, or

refusing to issue the certificate would be detrimental to Australia's interests

AND

the individual is unable (not unwilling) to provide security satisfactory to the Secretary for their return to Australia.

Humanitarian grounds include compassionate grounds.

The onus is on the individual to provide evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that shows their situation meets the above requirements.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102H When Secretary must issue departure authorisation certificate

Secretary may substitute a later return date on the DAC

The Secretary may substitute a later return date on a DAC, either in response to an application by the individual or by their own initiative. The individual may apply in person or in writing.

The Secretary may refuse to substitute a later date for the individual's return if they believe an extension would be inappropriate.

The Secretary has the discretion to ask for an additional amount of security, even where a security was not previously required.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102J Security for person's return to Australia

Departure dates for a DAC

A DAC authorises an individual's departure from Australia within an 8 day period beginning on the date specified on the certificate. The date specified on the certificate can only be within 1 and 7 days after the date the certificate is issued.

A DAC can only be issued between 1 and 14 days before the individual's intended date of departure.

Usually, the Secretary will specify the date on the certificate to be the individual's intended date of departure. However, the Secretary can specify a date other than the individual's intended date of departure-within the period outlined above-where it is appropriate to do so.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102K What departure authorisation certificate must authorise

Notification requirements to make, vary or refuse a DAC

Where the Secretary makes or decides to substitute a later day in a DAC, the Secretary must notify:

the individual to whom the DAC applies, and

any other person who was notified of the DPO.

If the Secretary rejects an application to issue a DAC or substitute a later day, they must notify the individual as soon as practicable.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102L Notification requirements for departure authorisation certificates, section 102M Notification requirements for substituted days.

1.1.S.40 Sessions of care (CCS)

Definition

A 'session of care' is the period of time that an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) charges a fee to an individual (

1.1.I.90

) for providing child care. A session of care may be any length up to a maximum of 12 hours.

To avoid doubt, a genuine legal liability must arise under an arrangement (

4.13.2

) which requires an individual to pay the fee irrespective of any payment made by the Secretary under the

FA

law to discharge some or all of that liability.

Approved providers and individuals need to agree, under a

CWA

, on the details of the sessions of care the individual will be liable to pay for, including the length of the sessions. Depending on charging practices of approved providers, individuals may be charged for a full session of care even if their child does not attend the whole session.

Example

: An

OSHC

service offers a session of care from 3.00 pm to 6.00 pm, for which it charges parents a flat rate of $25 per session. A child attends care from 3:00 pm until 5:00 pm. Although the child has attended 2 hours of care, the parent has a genuine liability for 3 hours of care and their

CCS

entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) will be calculated for 3 hours.

A session of care generally cannot be reported during a time when the approved provider is not open and available to provide child care (except where the service is closed due to a public holiday or a period of emergency).

Reporting care where there is no eligibility for CCS or

ACCS

or where no care occurred may be an offence or breach of a civil penalty provision under FA law.

2.8.2.40 ACCS (grandparent) - applications

Summary

This topic describes the requirement to apply for

ACCS

(grandparent) and covers:

applying for ACCS (grandparent)

information required when applying for ACCS (grandparent)

requirement for additional information when an application is incomplete

where both grandparents in a couple may be eligible

date of effect of applications for ACCS (grandparent)

backdating of applications for ACCS (grandparent).

Applying for ACCS (grandparent)

Only the individual (

1.1.I.90

) who is responsible for the care of the child, or their partner (

1.1.P.30

), can claim (

1.1.C.27

) ACCS (grandparent). An application must be made to Centrelink.

An individual can lodge an application through Centrelink online, in person or over the phone.

An individual can apply for ACCS (grandparent) when in receipt of

CCS

or at the same time as claiming CCS. If claiming CCS and ACCS as a combined claim, the individual must be determined to be eligible for CCS before a determination is made for ACCS (grandparent).

If a grandparent (

1.1.G.14

) has more than one child in their care, they must meet the eligibility criteria for each child they are claiming ACCS (grandparent) for. This means that an individual may receive ACCS (grandparent) payment for a child/ren and CCS for the remaining child/ren.

Information required when applying for ACCS (grandparent)

In addition to information required to claim CCS (such as personal details, income (

1.1.I.20

) estimate and recognised participation details), an individual needs to provide the following information when applying for ACCS (grandparent):

details of the child/ren to whom the ACCS (grandparent) claim relates

the nature of the relationship between the individual or their partner, if they have one, and the child/ren with supporting evidence

the percentage of care provided to the child/ren the subject of the claim with supporting evidence

evidence of substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child/ren's care

indicative period for which the subsidy is being sought, if known, and

evidence/other documentation to support the application.

Requirement for additional information where the application is incomplete

If additional information (such as additional evidence of the relationship or principal care provided) is required to assess whether the individual is eligible for ACCS (grandparent) the individual will have 28 days in which to provide the information.

If the requested documentation is not provided within 28 days, the application will be taken not to have been made and the individual will be required to submit a new application.

Once the application has been assessed, grandparents will receive a notification of the outcome (through the grandparent's nominated form of communication).

Where both grandparents in a couple may be eligible

On a day-to-day basis, both grandparents may be partners and jointly provide care to the child and share 65% or more of the care. This is not a shared care arrangement and only one grandparent can be eligible for ACCS (grandparent). The grandparents will need to determine who will be considered as the applicant, and if eligible, the recipient of ACCS (grandparent).

Date of effect of applications for ACCS (grandparent)

The start date of ACCS (grandparent) must be the Monday at the start of a CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

). Applications for ACCS (grandparent) can be backdated up to 28 days from the date the completed claim was lodged with Centrelink.

Backdating of applications for ACCS (grandparent)

An application for ACCS (grandparent) can only be backdated 28 days from the date of application.

3.6.3 FTB Part B - historical rates

Summary

This topic contains historical rates of

FTB

Part B, FTB Part B supplement and

ES

Part B.

Maximum rate of FTB Part B

An individual’s maximum rate of FTB Part B is determined based on their income (and their partner’s income, where applicable), and the age of the youngest child in the family.

The maximum rate of FTB Part B is payable to single parent families when their income is equal to or below the primary earner income limit.

For couple families, the maximum rate of FTB Part B is reduced by 20c for every dollar that the lower income earner earns above the income free area, provided the higher income earner’s income is not above the primary earner income limit.

Note:

FTB Part B supplement was introduced from 1 January 2005. The supplement is a component of the annual maximum FTB Part B rate and is paid after reconciliation. The supplement is not included in the fortnightly rates.

Note:

The FTB Part B primary earner income limit of $150,000 was introduced from 1 July 2008. This changed to $100,000 from 1 July 2015. Indexation of the primary earner income limit commenced from 1 July 2021.

The table below shows the maximum FTB part B rate, income free area and primary earner income limit. Rates shown are fortnightly, except where indicated otherwise.

2.8.3.40 ACCS (temporary financial hardship) - determinations

Summary

This topic sets out the requirements for an

ACCS

(temporary financial hardship) determination and covers:

making a determination

requirements for determinations

when a determination must be made

date of application

requesting additional information

deemed refusals

date of effect

changes to determinations.

Making a determination

There are 2 ways in which an ACCS determination can be made to account for an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) temporary financial hardship:

individuals can apply to Centrelink for a determination, or

the Secretary can make a determination on their own initiative in relation to that individual.

A determination that an individual is experiencing temporary financial hardship gives an ACCS (temporary financial hardship) entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) of:

a subsidy equal to 100% of the actual fee charged, up to 120% of the

CCS

hourly rate cap (

1.1.H.20

), and

up to 100 hours of subsidy per fortnight.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CH(1) Determinations on own initiative or on application

Requirements for determinations

Determinations of ACCS (temporary financial hardship) must:

specify the day that it takes effect, which must be a Monday and cannot be more than 28 days before the application was made. See Explanation 1 for detail.

specify the whole weeks (from Monday to Sunday) for which it has effect (that is, a determination cannot be made for part of a week). See Explanation 2 for detail.

identify the child to whom it relates, and

identify the individual to whom it relates.

Explanation 1:

This can be either Monday in a CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) as long as that Monday falls within a CCS fortnight where the individual is CCS eligible on the first Monday of the CCS fortnight (this is because an individual can only receive ACCS when they are CCS eligible).

Explanation 2:

A determination may commence or cease mid-way through a CCS fortnight. The FAAct Schedule 2, section 11(5) provides that the recognised activity test result will be 100 hours for the CCS fortnight. However, the application of the activity test result for these 'shoulder' week/s is not included in the counting of weeks towards the total of 13 weeks, (that is, only the week/s specified in a determination will count towards the total of 13 weeks for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)). The increased subsidy is paid for all sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) during a week where the individual is eligible for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) for at least one session of care during the week.

These requirements apply regardless of whether the determination is made in relation to an application from an individual, or on the initiative of the Secretary.

While a determination is linked to a particular child and a particular individual, if the individual has multiple children, the individual can select which children the application relates to and have multiple determinations (one for each child selected) in effect.

Where a determination is made in relation to one or more temporary financial hardship circumstances, the determination will clearly outline which circumstances have, and have not, been taken into account in reaching the determination.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CH Determination of temporary financial hardship, Schedule 2 clause 11(5) Individual eligible for CCS and ACCS in same CCS fortnight

When a determination must be made

Determinations for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) must be made within 28 days from the date of application. If a determination is not made within the 28 days, the application will be deemed to have been refused (a 'deemed refusal').

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CH Determination of temporary financial hardship

Date of application

The date of application for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) is the date when the application has met all form and manner requirements, and the correct evidence has been provided. If the supporting evidence upon which the applicant is relying on is not provided, the application will be taken to have never been made.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CH Determination of temporary financial hardship

Requesting additional information

Once an application is made, additional information may be requested from the individual to assist the decision-making process. The notice for additional information should specify the period in which the information must be given. This is to ensure that a decision can be made within 28 days from when the application was made (date of application). If the requested additional information is not provided within the specified timeframe requested by Centrelink, the decision maker can make a decision based on the information currently available to them.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 67FI Request for information in relation to eligibility or entitlement for CCS or ACCS

Deemed refusals

Centrelink has 28 days from the date of application in which to make a decision. Under

FA

law, if a decision is not made within this timeframe, the application is deemed to be refused (a 'deemed refusal').

Individuals should provide all the necessary information and respond to Centrelink requests for additional information as soon as possible.

When an application is 'deemed refused', it is automatically assigned for internal review by Centrelink. The application will be assessed and a decision will be made (that is, reject the application or accept the application and make a determination). The decision the Centrelink reviewing officer makes can be appealed by the individual, in line with the Centrelink's review and appeal processes.

Act reference:

FA Guide

External reviews

Date of Effect for Determinations

The start date of ACCS (temporary financial hardship) must be on a Monday. Individuals can ask for their application to be backdated up to and including 28 days from the date the application was taken to be made.

It is not possible to backdate to prior to the date of the circumstance or event that gave rise to the temporary financial hardship. Otherwise, as long as all other criteria are met for a favourable determination, then any request for backdating should be approved, noting that it cannot increase the number of weeks the individual is eligible for ACCS (temporary financial hardship), and be no greater than 13 weeks per circumstance.

Changes to determinations of ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

A determination of ACCS (temporary financial hardship) can be changed (that is, varied or revoked), if:

an individual no longer finds themselves in temporary financial hardship, or

Centrelink determines that an individual is no longer/or was never in temporary financial hardship.

If a determination is varied, it can only reduce the number of whole weeks for which it takes effect, not to increase the number of weeks of ACCS (temporary financial hardship). Variations can include changing the start date of the determination to a later Monday or bringing forward the end date to an earlier Monday.

If a determination is revoked, the whole determination is taken not to have been in effect.

2.1.1 FTB child & regular care child

Introduction

This section covers eligibility requirements relating to an

FTB

child and a regular care child. The first topic outlines the situations when a child may be an FTB child and subsequent topics expand on each of those situations.

Comparison between FTB child & a dependent child defined by the SSAct

While in most cases a child considered to be an FTB child under the FAAct will also be a dependent child under the SSAct, there are some cases where this will not be true. The following table summarises the main differences.

To be an FTB child

To be a dependent child

A child must be up to 15 years, or 16 to 19 years and in full-time secondary study (including those repeating year 12) or be exempt from this requirement.

A child must be under the age of 22 years.

A child aged 16 to 19 years must be a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

).

A child aged 16 to 21 years must be in full-time study.

The child's income does not apply.

The child's income (using the definition of income defined in the SSAct) cannot exceed the personal income limit. For a child under 16 years, this is a weekly amount. For a child 16 years and over, this is income in a financial year.

A child aged 16 or over cannot be receiving a prescribed education scheme payment (

1.1.P.100

).

A child aged 16 or over can be receiving a prescribed education scheme payment.

Where care of the child is shared between 2 or more individuals, the child must be in the individual's care for at least 35% of the time.

Where care of the child is shared between 2 or more individuals there is no minimum percentage of care.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 22 When an individual is an FTB child of another individual, section 22A Exceptions to the operation of section 22, section 25 Effect of an individual's percentage of care for a child being less than 35%

FTB Part A supplement

The FTB Part A supplement is part of the annual rate of FTB Part A for each FTB child. The current maximum FTB Part A supplement is $938.05. The supplement is only available to an individual after the end of the financial year after FTB has been reconciled. Payment of the supplement is conditional on the individual and/or their partner lodging an income tax return (if required) or notifying Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

Note:

If an individual's

ATI

(which includes the ATI of their partner, if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

Note:

The FTB Part A supplement, as well as other FTB top-up payments, may be used to offset an individual's outstanding FTB and/or

CCS

reconciliation debts and may also be used by the

ATO

to offset a tax debt. See

4.15.2 Determination of SBP claims

Introduction

This section describes the provisions relating to the determination of

SBP

claims and covers the following:

claim is withdrawn before it is determined

deferral of SBP determination pending resolution of

PLP

effective claim must be determined.

Claim is withdrawn before it is determined

A person can withdraw their claim if it has not yet been determined. If the claim is withdrawn it is taken to never have been made.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 40 Claim may be withdrawn

Deferral of SBP determination pending resolution of PLP

Where an individual claims SBP and they or their partner have also claimed PLP for the same child, the Secretary must defer the determination of the SBP claim. The SBP claim cannot be determined until one of the following occurs:

if a determination has been made that PLP is payable for the child

the first PLP instalment period (PPL Guide

1.1.I.80

) has ended, or

the payability determination is revoked

the claim for PLP is rejected (that is, the individual is not eligible for PLP), or

the claim for PLP is withdrawn (that is, the individual elects to receive SBP).

If the individual does not advise that they wish to withdraw their PLP claim, the PLP determination will be made when the first PLP instalment period has ended and the SBP claim will be rejected. If the PLP payability determination is revoked, the SBP claim can be determined.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 41(3) Deferral of 'normal circumstances' SBP …

Effective claim must be determined

If a claim for SBP in normal circumstances or a bereavement claim is effective, it must be determined. If a claim is not effective, it is taken never to have been made.

Example:

Chris lodged a claim for SBP, but did not complete all the questions on the claim. Centrelink sent Chris a written request for the rest of the information required to assess her eligibility. Chris did not respond to the request. As the claim is incomplete there is insufficient information available to determine the claim, and the claim is found not to be effective. Once the claim is found not to be effective it is taken never to have been made. If Chris wishes to test her eligibility again she must lodge a new claim.

If the individual is eligible for SBP, a determination must be made that the individual is entitled to be paid and the amount of the payment. If the individual is not eligible for SBP, a determination must be made that the individual is not entitled to be paid.

Once a determination is made, it comes into force when it is made and remains in force at all times afterwards.

Centrelink must give notice of the determination to the claimant stating:

whether they are entitled to be paid under the determination, and

if the claimant is entitled to payment, the amount of SBP and how it is to be paid.

A determination to grant or reject a claim may be reviewed.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 36 When an individual is eligible for SBP …, section 38 What happens if an individual …

FA(Admin)Act

section 41 Secretary must determine claim, section 42 Determination of 'normal circumstances' entitlement claim, section 43 Determination of 'bereavement' entitlement claim, section 44 Determination that no entitlement, section 45 When determination is in force, section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative

1.1.R.23 Relevant income year

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

(

1.1.F.02

), 'relevant income year' is the income year for which

FTB

and/or

CCS

has been paid. Although a recipient (

1.1.R.07

) may only be eligible for FTB and/or CCS for part of the income year (the claim (

1.1.C.27

) period), their entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) is reconciled on their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the entire income year.

================================================================================
3.1.8.20 Method 2 - FTB Part A income test

Income test -

FTB

Part A Method 2

The FTB Part A Method 2 income test is applied when an individual's

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for a relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) is greater than the higher income free area (

1.1.H.10

) for that year. Under the FTB Part A Method 2 income test, the individual’s rate of FTB Part A is reduced as described below.

Reduction after reaching the higher income free area

When an individual's ATI exceeds the higher income free area, their FTB Part A is reduced by 30% of the income excess until FTB Part A is no longer payable. This reduction from the maximum rate (

1.1.M.26

) results in the individual's provisional FTB Part A rate.

The Method 2 calculation also requires the individual's income and maintenance tested rate to be calculated under Method 1. However, when doing so, income in excess of the income free area, but equal to or below the higher income free area, reduces the rate by 20%, while income in excess of the higher income free area reduces the rate by 30%. The individual's provisional FTB Part A rate is compared to their income and maintenance tested rate and the higher of the 2 is payable.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 25 Method of calculating Part A rate

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.8.10

Method 2 - calculating the maximum rate of FTB Part A

Example - calculating FTB Part A rate under Method 2

Kanika and her partner have 2 FTB children, Rahul aged 6, and Pallavi aged 8. The family's ATI for the 2019-20 income year is $102,000.

The following table shows how to calculate the family's FTB Part A rate. As the family's ATI is greater than the higher income free area, their rate of FTB Part A will be calculated using Method 2. However, as Step 3 of Method 2 requires a comparative Method 1 calculation using a 30% taper for income above the higher income free area, the Method 1 FTB child rates have also been calculated. The higher of the 2 rates calculated under Method 1 and Method 2 will be Kanika's rate of FTB Part A.

Step

Action

Amount

1

Determine the FTB child rate (

1.1.F.57

) for each child under Method 1 and Method 2.

Note:

This calculation uses maximum and base standard rates as at 1 July 2019.

Method 1 $4,854.50

Method 2 $1,558.55

2

Determine the

ES

child rate (

3.1.1.25

) payable for each FTB child under Method 1 and Method 2.

Method 1 $91.25

Method 2 $36.50

3

Determine the FTB Part A supplement amounts for each FTB child.

Not eligible (ATI over $80,000.00)

4

Determine the maximum rate (including FTB Part A supplement and ES Part A).

Method 1 ($4,945.75 x 2)= $9,891.50

Method 2 ($1,595.05 x 2)= $3,190.10

5

Apply ATI test

Method 1

Calculate income excess

Higher income free area less the income free area

$98,988.00 − $54,677.00 = $44,311.00

Reduction for ATI = 20% of the income excess

$44,311.00 × 20% = $8,862.20

ATI less the higher income free area

$102,000.00 - $98,988.00 = $3,012.00

Reduction for ATI = 30% of the income excess

$3,012.00 x 30% = $903.60

Income excess

$8,862.20 + $903.60 = $9,765.80

Income tested rate

$9,891.50 − $9,765.80 = $125.70

Method 2

Calculate income excess

ATI less the higher income free area

$102,000.00 − $98,988.00 = $3,012.00

Apply income reduction

$3,012.00 × 30% = $903.60

$3,190.10 − $903.60 = $2,286.50

Rate using Method 1 = $125.70

Rate using Method 2 = $2,286.50

6

The family's rate of FTB Part A is the higher of the rates worked out using Method 1 and Method 2.

$2,286.50

2.1.1.100 Child at risk of harm

Note

Although this topic has an

FTB

focus, to ensure consistency across different program areas, the policy that is reflected in this topic is also applicable to social security payments. The focus of this topic is also on payment eligibility as a result of having an 'FTB child' or a 'dependent child'. However the rate of some social security payments is also affected by having a 'dependent child' and therefore the principles in this topic may also be relevant for determining whether the child should be taken into account in determining the rate of a social security payment.

Summary

Sometimes children, especially in the older age groups, may live with adults who are providing care for a child on an informal basis. This topic explains the principles for dealing with cases when the 'caring' arrangements may not be in the best interests of the child.

Examples:

exposure to alcohol, drugs or substance abuse

involvement in criminal, sexual or unhealthy activities

lack of guidance or oversight in issues such as schooling or moral matters

alienation of family and friends, and/or

disregard for well-being and daily needs, for example, food, health, hygiene and safety etc.

When assessing levels of care (

1.1.C.90

) there are numerous considerations that must be taken into account regarding legal responsibility, care, welfare and development of the child.

Referral to a social worker

The case should be referred to a social worker if:

the child is not a family member of the person claiming FTB or a social security payment that is dependent on the provision of care for a child, and

the person has not supplied documentation to support that the child is legally in their care, or

the person has previously lost care of children.

Continuation of payment

If the case is being referred to a social worker, FTB, or any other payment the losing carer is receiving for the child, should not be cancelled before the social worker has made a recommendation.

Exception:

If the child has been away from the previous carer for more than 4 weeks, FTB should be cancelled unless the disputed care provisions apply.

Example 1:

Greg is a 15 year old youth living on the streets. He applies for

YA

at the independent rate. When the social worker explains to Greg that he would need to be referred to a State welfare agency under the Commonwealth/State Youth Protocols, Greg withdraws the claim. Two weeks later Greg attends another office with a man about 50 years of age. The adult claims FTB for Greg, stating that he is his guardian and is now supporting him. The adult is not registered as a foster carer with the state welfare department. The case should be referred to the social worker for a recommendation.

Example 2:

Mike is a 14 year old who does not wish to live at home because he believes his parents are too strict about him drinking alcohol and not attending school. His parents are not providing financial support in the hope he will eventually return home. He has repeatedly run away and moves in with a man in the neighbourhood who provides for his basic needs and is more accepting of his life style. He applies for FTB for assistance with providing his material needs. Allowing Mike to drink alcohol and not attend school does not constitute proper care. The case should be referred to the social worker for a recommendation.

section 22 When an individual is an FTB child of another individual, section 23 Effect of FTB child ceasing to be in individual's care without consent

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.70

Disputed care arrangements

Role of the social worker

In all cases in which the child may be at risk, the social worker will:

contact the losing carer to advise that a claim has been lodged in respect of their child

obtain any necessary information about the reason for the change and its likely duration

seek approval for disclosure of information in the public interest where indicated

make a recommendation to the Centrelink officer about payment of FTB, and

make a recommendation to the Centrelink officer about other affected payments.

The following table explains special social worker requirements for some children:

If a case involves a …

then the social worker should consult with …

child of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group

an

ISO

on any relevant cultural issues.

refugee child

a

MSO

to identify any relevant cultural factors.

Disclosure of information in the public interest

A disclosure of information takes the form of a referral to the relevant state welfare agency. In this case, the Centrelink officer must decide whether to grant the claim or hold it pending any state action. The following table outlines how the claim should be treated.

If the …

then the claim …

officer is satisfied that the child is an FTB child of the individual

can be granted. If a claim has also been made for a social security payment, the officer should liaise with Centrelink to ensure a consistent outcome.

can be granted. If a claim has also been made for FTB, the officer should liaise with Centrelink to ensure a consistent outcome.

claim is held pending any state action

should be reviewed after 28 days.

Due weight must be given to the social work recommendation in each case.

2.1.1.60 Change of care of an FTB child

Summary

This topic provides information on:

the requirement to notify Centrelink of a change in circumstances

circumstances in which

FTB

may continue to be paid

verification of care when a new carer claims FTB, and

new carer in hardship.

Requirement to notify Centrelink of a change in circumstances

A person (

1.1.P.80

) receiving instalment payments of FTB is required to notify Centrelink of any change in circumstances that can affect their eligibility for FTB. If the person stops having the daily care of an FTB child, they must notify Centrelink regardless of whether another person is expected to claim for the child.

Circumstances in which FTB may continue to be paid

In some circumstances, payment of FTB to an individual can be extended if their child is prevented from being in their care without their consent or legal authority.

FTB may also continue to be paid to an individual in circumstances where there is a short-term deviation from the normal care arrangements for a child, such as when care of the child has been delegated (

2.1.1.85

) to another individual or organisation. For example, when the child is with another carer or

ACO

on holidays, or where the usual parent or carer is in hospital receiving medical care.

Example:

Kellie has 100% care of their child, Erika. Kellie has agreed with Erika's other parent, Gavin, that Erika be in Gavin's care for 3 weeks while Kellie is recovering from surgery. As care of Erika has been delegated to Gavin under a short term temporary arrangement, Kellie will still receive FTB for Erika.

Formal & informal care of an FTB child

Verification of care when a new carer claims FTB

When a claim for FTB is received from a new carer, including an ACO, the decision-maker must determine whether there has been a change in care for FTB purposes. For a detailed discussion on how to determine this, see

2.1.1.85

.

As part of the process of determining whether there has been a change in care for FTB purposes, the decision-maker must verify who is actually caring for the child.

If legal responsibility for the child has been transferred to the new carer (formal care), the relevant court or state/welfare authority can assist in verifying care. However, evidence of who is actually caring for the child should also be obtained. Evidence may be obtained from a range of sources, including:

confirmation of play group, kindergarten or school enrolment

proof of attendance or membership of local organisations or activities

receipts for expenses incurred while the child was in care

confirmation of the level of care from close family friends or relatives

confirmation from professional members of the community who have regular contact with the family, such as teachers, social workers, police, ministers of religion, accountants, lawyers or doctors, and

records from Centrelink or other government agencies which confirm the care.

It may be more difficult to verify who is caring for the child where legal responsibility has not been transferred (informal care). If a new carer does not have legal responsibility for the child, it is necessary to confirm that the child is not in the care of a person who does have legal responsibility for the child. Evidence of who is actually caring for the child may be obtained from a range of sources, as outlined above.

The new carer should be advised that, if the losing carer provides conflicting information about who is caring of the child, payment of FTB will be reviewed, which may lead to an overpayment.

An ACO would not generally be eligible for FTB for a child in their care for a period under 28 days as this may be considered to be delegated care. However, there may be situations where the child is in the care of an ACO for under 28 days but the previous carer does not want to be paid FTB for the child. In this case, the ACO may be eligible for FTB from the date the child enters their care.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 22 When an individual is an FTB child of another individual

New carer in hardship

The new carer's eligibility for FTB may be determined without delay if the new carer is:

in financial hardship

claiming an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) through Centrelink, and

the previous carer cannot be contacted by phone.

Verification of who is caring for the child is still required as for any other change of care situation.

7.2.7 Debt recovery by garnishee

Summary

This section provides information about recovering a debt (

1.1.D.60

) by means of a garnishee notice (

1.1.G.10

). It includes:

who can a garnishee notice be issued to

what information is contained in a garnishee notice

when payment must be made

compliance with a garnishee notice, and

garnishee of trust funds, superannuation and deceased estates.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

7.2.1

Debt recovery - general provisions

Who can a garnishee notice be issued to?

A garnishee notice may be issued to any person who:

owes or will owe, money to the debtor

holds, or may subsequently hold, money for or on account of the debtor

holds, or may subsequently hold, money on account of some other person for payment to the debtor, or

has authority from some other person to pay money to the debtor.

This applies to an amount regardless of any law of a state or territory under which the amount may be inalienable. If money is to be paid to the debtor only if a condition is met, then the money is taken to be due on demand even if the condition is not met.

Example:

A garnishee notice can be issued to a person's employer, bank or solicitor.

A copy of the garnishee notice must be given to the debtor.

The person who has been issued with a garnishee notice becomes a garnishee debtor (

1.1.G.10

).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 89 Garnishee notice

What information is contained in a garnishee notice?

The notice requires the garnishee debtor to pay:

an amount specified in the notice, which is no more than the amount of the debt or than the amount that can be recovered from the garnishee debtor (see explanation), or

Explanation:

The amount that can be recovered relates to the amount the person owes or will owe or hold for the original debtor.

an amount or percentage specified in the notice out of each payment that the garnishee debtor will become liable to pay the debtor from time to time, until the debt is satisfied.

When must the payment be made?

The date by which payment must be made is specified in the notice. This date cannot be before either:

the money becomes due, or is held by the garnishee debtor, or

before the end of the period of 14 days after the notice is given.

Compliance with a garnishee notice

A person cannot refuse or fail to comply with a garnishee notice to the extent to which they are capable of complying with the notice. The penalty for failure to do so is 12 months imprisonment.

If the garnishee debtor fails to comply with the notice, the amount of the debt outstanding is recoverable from the garnishee debtor by means of:

legal proceedings, or

a garnishee notice.

The amount outstanding is the lesser of the amount the:

garnishee debtor was required to pay at that time, or

original debtor was required to have paid at that time.

If an amount is recovered from either the original debtor or the garnishee debtor, the amount reduces the balance of both debts.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 80 Debt from failure to comply with garnishee notice, section 89 Garnishee notice

Payments made by garnishee

Payments made by a garnishee debtor are taken to have been made with the authority of the original debtor.

When the debtor or anyone on their behalf makes a payment, the garnishee debtor must be notified that the debt has been reduced by the amount paid.

Garnishee of term deposits

Where a garnishee notice is issued to a financial institution against a term deposit, the notice immediately attaches to that account. However, the financial institution is not liable to pay the garnisheed amount to Centrelink until the term deposit matures or is terminated by the individual. Although Centrelink is not restricted from approaching the individual to discuss early termination of the term deposit, there is no legislative authority to request the individual to do so.

Garnishee of trust funds

The only circumstances in which a garnishee notice may be issued against a trust fund are when the:

debtor is owed money by the trust fund, or

trust fund does not have the true nature of a trust (see explanation).

Explanation:

If the nature of the trust is difficult to identify the case should be referred to the Helpdesk for advice.

A garnishee notice should not be issued against a trust fund:

where the debtor is a beneficiary of the trust, but is not owed money by the trust, or

where the trust does not appear to have the true nature of a trust, but this is due to a breach of the trustee's obligations as a trustee (the trustee's fiduciary duties) rather than a defect in the creation of the trust.

Garnishee of superannuation funds

A garnishee notice should not be issued against a superannuation fund under any circumstances.

Garnishee notices & deceased estates

Under no circumstances should a garnishee notice be served on the executor of the estate of a deceased individual.

Under FA(Admin)Act section 89 a garnishee notice may be issued against a person who 'holds … money for or on account of the debtor'. An executor cannot be said to hold an estate 'for or on account' of the deceased person and therefore a garnishee notice must not be issued under section 89 in these circumstances.

Garnishee of joint bank accounts

A garnishee notice cannot be issued against a joint bank account because it is not possible to identify any portion as belonging solely to one owner.

Garnishee notices & bankruptcy

A garnishee notice cannot be issued once a debtor has become bankrupt because the debt is no longer a 'debt due to the Commonwealth' for the purposes of the SSAct.

The Commonwealth can rely on a garnishee notice issued prior to bankruptcy, but only where the debt was due before the bankruptcy commenced. In cases where the garnishee notice was issued prior to bankruptcy but was not complied with before the funds were vested in the trustee, specific advice should be sought.

4.7.1 CCS & ACCS allowable absences

Summary

CCS

or

ACCS

is payable for up to 42 absence days per child, across all approved child care services they attend, during each financial year. These are called allowable absences. Allowable absences can be used for any reason, including for public holidays or when the child is sick. No supporting documentation is required to access these payable absences.

The 42 allowable absences are used consecutively and must be used before any additional absences (

1.1.A.17

) can be accessed.

In shared care arrangements (where separated parents both claim CCS for the child's care), the 42 absences are allocated to the child, not to each individual parent.

3.2.3 Adjusted fringe benefits total

Introduction

Fringe benefits are benefits that an employee receives from their employer, which could include expense payments, the use or ownership of something or the enjoyment of a privilege. The benefit may be assigned to someone else, such as a spouse or child. The value of these fringe benefits is included in an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) adjusted fringe benefits total, regardless of whether they were received in Australia (

1.1.A.120

) or overseas.

Explanation:

Employees may 'sacrifice' an amount of their cash salary and receive the value of the amount as a fringe benefit. In other cases, a fringe benefit may be a fixed part of the employee's salary package.

In relation to

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

), an individual's adjusted fringe benefits total for an income year is the amount worked out using the following formula from 1 January 2017.

((Exempt employer fringe benefits total) x (1 - Applicable fringe benefits tax rate)) + Non-exempt employer fringe benefits total

An individual's exempt employer fringe benefits total is the sum of reportable fringe benefits the individual receives from employers who are identified under the

Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986

section 57A. An individual's exempt employer fringe benefits total is adjusted for the purposes of the

FTB

,

SBP

,

PLP

,

CCS

and

ACCS

income tests (see below). This means that fringe benefits amounts derived from these employers will not be fully counted towards the income test. Payment recipients are required to include the full reportable amount in their income estimate and Centrelink automatically adjusts the amount by multiplying it by 1 minus the applicable

FBT

rate.

Examples of employers which are identified under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act section 57A include registered public benevolent institutions, registered health promotion charities, some hospitals and public ambulance services.

An individual's non-exempt employer fringe benefits total is the sum of reportable fringe benefits the individual receives from all other employers. An individual's non-exempt employer fringe benefits total is not adjusted for the purposes of the FTB, SBP, PLP, CCS and ACCS income tests. The total amount is the same as the reportable amount in their income estimate and Centrelink makes no adjustment to that amount.

Individuals do not need to include a fringe benefit amount when reporting to the

ATO

if the total of their fringe benefits amount is under the relevant ATO fringe benefits threshold. If the value of the individual's fringe benefits is under the relevant ATO threshold, they will not have a reportable amount. If an individual includes a fringe benefit amount in their income estimate which is under the relevant ATO threshold, Centrelink will treat the amount as nil.

Salary sacrificing & fringe benefits

Common forms of salary sacrifice or fringe benefits include:

leasing of vehicles

investments

expense benefits

housing assistance

low interest loans, and

child care.

Note:

If you salary sacrifice your child care fees, the amount of CCS or ACCS you will be eligible to receive may be affected.

As the value of the benefit is not recorded as salary for the employee, they do not pay income tax on that amount. Instead, the employer may pay FBT on the value of the benefit.

The reportable amount of the fringe benefit is recorded on the employee's end of financial year payment summary and identifies whether or not the income is an exempt benefit from an employer described in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act section 57A. Only reportable fringe benefits are assessable for the purposes of the FTB, SBP, PLP, CCS and ACCS income tests.

If an individual is not sure whether a benefit they receive from their employer is a reportable fringe benefit, they should contact their employer or the ATO for advice.

FA Guide

SBP eligibility criteria

FBT year

The FBT assessment year is from 1 April to 31 March. The FBT assessment year corresponds with the financial year that ends in the same calendar year.

Example:

The FBT assessment year ending 31 March 2017 corresponds to the financial year ending 30 June 2017. Fringe benefits received from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017 will appear on an employee's payment summary for the 2016-17 financial year.

Reportable fringe benefits

The reportable fringe benefit is the amount that appears on an employee's end of financial year payment summary. The reportable amount is the 'grossed-up' value of the fringe benefit. A grossed up value of both non-exempt and exempt employer fringe benefits totals will appear on the payment summary.

The grossed-up value is calculated using the following formula.

Reportable fringe benefit = Total taxable value of fringe benefit divided by (1 - FBT rate)

FBT rate

The FBT rate is set out in the

Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986

section 6. It is the highest marginal tax rate including the Medicare Levy and the Temporary Budget Repair Levy. The applicable FBT rate can be found on the ATO's website.

Adjusting the exempt employer fringe benefits total

The value of exempt employer fringe benefits total that Centrelink uses for the purposes of the FTB, SBP, PLP, CCS and ACCS income tests is adjusted using the following formula.

Centrelink-adjusted exempt employer fringe benefits total = Exempt employer reportable fringe benefit × (1 - FBT rate)

Example:

During the 2016-17 year, John has received fringe benefits from 2 employers which are identified as exempt employers. The amounts on his payment summaries are $3,883.50 and $5,825.24 giving a total reportable amount of $9,708.74. John notifies this amount to Centrelink.

Centrelink then adjusts John's exempt employer fringe benefits total = $9,708.74 × (1 - 0.49) = $4,951 (rounded to the whole dollar).

Note:

Adjusting the exempt employer fringe benefits total has the effect of subtracting the gross-up factor from the employee's reportable fringe benefits total for income received from exempt employers. Only the cash or market value of these fringe benefits are assessed.

Effect of fringe benefits on the SBP income test

For the purposes of the SBP income test, the adjusted fringe benefit total is the estimated proportion of the amount that would appear on a payment summary corresponding with the financial year or years in which the 6-month income test period falls. As an example, if the SBP income test period started in February and ended in August, the estimated proportion of the fringe benefits received or likely to be received in this period should be included in the estimate. However, if the SBP income test period ends during the period of April to June, the payment summary for the period from April to June will not apply to the SBP income test period as it relates to the following financial year and fringe benefits received during that period should not be included in the estimate.

Where it is difficult for an individual to estimate fringe benefits likely to be received during the SBP income test period in the absence of a payment summary, the individual should make an effort to provide what evidence is available, such as an agreement with an employer, at the request of Centrelink.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 4 Adjusted fringe benefits total

FTB/CCS/ACCS instalment individual, SBP individual - estimating fringe benefits

If the individual or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) is receiving fringe benefits, they must include the amount of the reportable fringe benefits they expect to receive for that income year when estimating their total ATI. The individual must identify reportable fringe benefits amounts from exempt employers and non-exempt employers separately.

Explanation:

If a fringe benefit amount received from an exempt employer is declared by the individual in their estimate for FTB, CCS and ACCS purposes, the amount will be adjusted by Centrelink before being included in the income test. If a fringe benefit amount received from a non-exempt employer is declared by the individual in their estimate for FTB, CCS and ACCS purposes, the amount will not be adjusted by Centrelink and the 'grossed up' amount will be included in the relevant income test.

For the SBP income test, the individual needs to include the amount that they expect to receive for the part of the financial year or years that correspond with the relevant 6-month income test period and identify reportable fringe benefits amounts from exempt employers and non-exempt employers separately. For further details on how the income test period is defined see

4.15.1

for SBP.

If the employee is unsure of their reportable fringe benefits amount or whether their employer is an exempt employer identified under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 section 57A, they should contact their employer for advice.

Actual amounts of fringe benefits used in estimate - FTB, CCS & ACCS only

A fortnightly instalment recipient can update their estimate of ATI with the actual amount of reportable fringe benefits once the FBT assessment year has ceased. To do this they must contact the employer to find out the reportable fringe benefits total that will appear on their payment summary and whether their employer is an exempt employer.

Example:

John is receiving fortnightly instalments and has an estimated taxable income of:

$20,000 + $7,000 non-exempt employer fringe benefits total plus,

a total net investment loss of $5,000.

This gives an estimated ATI of $32,000 for the financial year.

On 15 April John contacts his employer and finds out his actual non-exempt employer fringe benefits total for the year appearing on his payment summary is $17,475.73. John should contact Centrelink to update his estimates accordingly.

Note:

An estimate for the purposes of the SBP income test does not need to be updated, as it is based on the 'best efforts' of the individual and will not be reconciled with actual income (

3.2.8.10

).

3.5.1 CCS - combined annual ATI

Summary

Combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is one of the factors that will determine a claimant's level of

CCS

.

This section includes:

determining an individual's CCS percentage

entitlement to the higher CCS

providing an annual income estimate

change in annual income estimate

An individual's actual CCS entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) for a financial year will be worked out at reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

), usually after the individual (

1.1.I.90

) has completed their tax return and their (and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) if they have one) actual ATI is known. As an individual's actual ATI is not known during the year, determinations of CCS entitlement are calculated according to the individual's estimate of what their combined ATI will be for the financial year.

Any difference between the amount of CCS an individual was paid during the year based on their estimated ATI and their actual CCS entitlement based on their actual ATI will be corrected at reconciliation (

6.4

). Generally, a debt will be raised if they were overpaid, and a lump sum payment made if they were paid less than they were actually entitled to.

Determining an individual's CCS percentage

The CCS percentage is used to determine an individual's CCS entitlement for a child's attendance at sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) at an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

).

This table shows the percentage of child care fees the government will contribute based on an individual's combined annual ATI:

Combined annual ATI*

Applicable CCS percentage of the actual fee charged or the relevant hourly rate cap (whichever is lower)

Equal to or below $85,279

90%

Above $85,279 and below $535,279

Decreasing from 90% to 0%

Subsidy decreases by 1% for each $5,000 of family income

Equal to or above $535,279

0%

*The lower income threshold ($85,279) will be indexed by

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year and the other thresholds will be increased accordingly. The figures in this table relate to the 2025-26 income year.

Families with incomes of $535,279 or more have an applicable CCS percentage of 0% - that is, they are not entitled to CCS.

Entitlement to the higher CCS

Families with multiple children who are CCS-eligible may receive a higher CCS rate for their second and younger children.

Eligible families may receive a higher subsidy, on top of their income tested CCS rate, for their second and younger children aged 5 or under. This applies up to a maximum subsidy rate of 95%. Families will continue to receive their income tested CCS rate for all other children.

Combined family income

Subsidy per cent of the actual fee charged (up to relevant percentage of the hourly rate cap)

Up to $143,273

95%

More than $143,273 to below $188,273

Decreasing to 80% by 1% for each $3,000 of family income

$188,273 to below $267,563

80%

$267,563 to below $357,563

Decreasing to 50% by 1% for each $3,000 of family income

$357,563 to below $367,563

50%

$367,563 or more

Higher CCS rates no longer apply, all children in the family will receive the standard CCS rate

If CCS eligibility for one or more children stops, entitlement to higher CCS for other children aged 5 or under may be reassessed.

Children who are entitled to both the higher CCS rate and

ACCS

will be paid the ACCS rate.

Sessions of

IHC

do not attract the higher subsidy for younger children. This is because IHC is subsidised on a family rather than per child basis (

2.6.6.20

).

However, children aged 5 or under in IHC are included in the family unit when determining access to the higher CCS rate.

Providing an annual income estimate

All individuals are required to provide a 'reasonable' ATI estimate when claiming CCS, irrespective of whether they receive an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

). Where an individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

), the individual will need to provide an estimate of both their and their partner's ATI for that year.

Individuals will also be required to provide a reasonable ATI estimate for each new financial year.

Change in annual income estimate

When a family experiences a change in circumstances that affects their eligibility and/or entitlement they are required to notify Centrelink of this new information as soon as possible. This means individuals are required to give a new income estimate when a change in circumstances (such as starting a new job) means the current ATI estimate is no longer accurate.

When an individual provides a new ATI estimate, it will be applied from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

). If an individual's income changes (for example, they start a new higher paying job), they should update their ATI estimate as soon as possible to ensure future payments are based on current information and reduce the risk of debt at reconciliation.

3.2.8.30 Revised estimates

Introduction

This topic relates to the making of revised income estimates in relation to

FTB

and

CCS

where a determination is in force for one or other of those payments. It also relates to revised estimates where a claim for

SBP

is rejected.

Changing an estimate

For FTB and CCS, individuals (

1.1.I.90

) may provide a revised estimate of their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) at any time during the financial year, either in writing, over the phone, or online. The revised estimate must reflect their estimated financial circumstances for the whole of the current financial year.

Where a claim for SBP has been rejected because of the income estimate, the individual's eligibility can be reviewed if the individual provides a revised estimate within 52 weeks of being notified of the rejection. The revised estimate must include the individual's income and, if the individual was partnered on the day the claim was lodged, the income of the person to whom they were partnered on the day the claim was lodged. This means that if the individual has separated since lodging the claim, their former partner's income for the 6-month income test period needs to be included in the revised estimate. If the individual wants to exclude their former partner's income from the income estimate, they need to lodge a new claim within the required timeframes (

4.15.1

).

In all cases where a revised estimate is provided Centrelink must make a determination on whether the new estimate is reasonable taking into account all available information.

Reason for change in estimate

For FTB and CCS, if the individual wishes to provide an estimate that is lower than their current estimate or the previous year's actual income they will need to give valid reasons for providing the lower figure.

If the estimate is being given over the phone, Centrelink must record the reason together with the amount and the financial year.

Estimate must be reasonable

Centrelink must be satisfied that the new estimate is reasonable, taking into account the reason for the change and the individual's expected financial circumstances for the income year.

Possible reasons for an individual providing a revised estimate could include the individual:

changing jobs or starting a new job

a change in the number of shifts, overtime, or weekend work

going on unpaid leave, such as parental leave

receiving or likely to receive a lump sum payment

restructuring their business or experiencing a business downturn, or

making a superannuation withdrawal.

The individual's explanation of how they calculated the estimate should be consistent with the estimated amount.

Example:

If the estimate has reduced, the reason given should be consistent with the reduction in income.

Any discrepancies must be discussed with the individual to see if any of the figures should be changed. The estimate used by Centrelink must be accepted by the individual.

Explanation:

Centrelink staff may assist the individual in working out the estimate, however the individual is legally responsible for the estimate and therefore must be satisfied with the figures they provide.

When an individual provides an estimate of their ATI that is not considered to be reasonable, and they are unwilling to discuss with Centrelink reasons for or possible changes to the estimate:

In the case of FTB - FTB entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) must be cancelled. The date of effect of the cancellation is the day after the end of the individual's latest entitlement period.

In the case of CCS - the individual's claim (

1.1.C.27

) should not be cancelled, however, it must be determined that the individual's CCS percentage (

1.1.A.70

) is zero.

In the case of SBP - the estimate cannot give rise to eligibility for SBP.

Application of the new estimate

For FTB and CCS, if the new estimate is considered reasonable it is applied to payments of the individual's FTB or CCS entitlement for the remainder of the financial year. For FTB, the individual's rate of FTB will be calculated on the basis of the new income estimate, but this rate may be reduced to take account of any overpayment of FTB that has notionally occurred in the financial year, following recalculation on the new estimate.

Where the new estimate is provided in the context of a review of the rejection of an SBP claim, if the new estimate is considered reasonable and below the income cut-off, and other eligibility criteria are satisfied, the individual can be paid SBP.

Offsetting a fluctuation in income

When an individuals' family income changes during the financial year they may already have received too much FTB and/or CCS. This may create a debt that Centrelink would generally recover after the end of the income year.

To help individuals avoid an end of year debt resulting from an incorrect income estimate, 5% of the weekly CCS entitlement will be withheld. Following reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

), any outstanding amounts owed to the individual will be paid to them directly as a lump sum. Individuals will also be able to update their income estimate at any time during the year, for example if their circumstances change, and their CCS percentage will be adjusted.

Where an individual who receives FTB by instalment provides an updated income estimate during the income year which changes their rate of entitlement Centrelink will be required to calculate whether a notional overpayment has occurred. If there is an overpayment Centrelink would adjust as necessary the individuals new daily rate of FTB based on the new income estimate for the remainder of the income year to reduce the notional overpayment of FTB which has occurred based on their previous income estimate in the earlier part of the year.

Where an individual's rate of FTB is being adjusted, any future increase or decrease in their income estimate during the income year will require a new calculation of the adjustment to their daily rate of FTB for the remainder of the income year.

Mandatory continuous adjustment also applies to an individual's rate of FTB where an indexed income estimate or indexed actual income is applied during the financial year, and where an individual's maintenance income estimate changes during the current income year.

1.2.20 2020 economic support payment (2020 ESP)

Background

The 2020 ESP provides 2 payments of $750 to eligible payment recipients and concession card holders. These payments are intended to address economic impacts of the global coronavirus.

Qualification

A person is qualified for the first 2020 ESP if they received any

FTB

for any eligibility day between 12 March 2020 and 13 April 2020 inclusive at a rate greater than nil and they were residing in Australia.

A person is qualified for the second 2020 ESP if they received any FTB on the eligibility day 10 July 2020 at a rate greater than nil and they were residing in Australia.

A person may also qualify for ESP if they are receiving another qualifying payment or are in possession of a qualifying concession card.

The following are qualifying payments:

Age

, FTB,

DSP

,

CP

,

CA

,

PPS

, parenting payment (partnered), wife pension, widow B pension, newstart allowance (

JSP

The following are qualifying concession cards:

Commonwealth seniors health card

pensioner concession card

Veteran Gold Card.

Entitled to only one payment

A person can receive only one first 2020 ESP and one second 2020 ESP. Where a person qualifies for a first and second 2020 ESP in multiple ways (through different payments or cards) they would only receive one first and second 2020 ESP. A person who is paid a first or second 2020 ESP and is subsequently granted another qualifying payment or concession card backdated to or before the eligibility days is not entitled to an additional first or second 2020 ESP.

Example:

On 12 March 2020, John is receiving both PPS and FTB. John receives the first 2020 ESP because of his PPS. He will not receive another first 2020 ESP with FTB.

Act Reference:

FAAct

section 112 More than one entitlement, section 115 More than one entitlement

Payability

The amount of the first and second 2020 ESP is $750. The amount is the same for single people and each eligible member of a couple. This means individuals who receive FTB because they both share care of a child will receive the same amount of payment. Similarly, each member of a couple in a blended family will receive the full amount of the payments.

A claim is not required for the ESP, it is paid automatically as a lump sum by Services Australia or DVA.

The ESP is non-taxable and does not count as income.

For income management and cashless debit card participants, 100% of the ESP is restricted and placed in either their income management account or on their Cashless Debit Card.

Act Reference:

FA(Admin)Act

Section 65JA Payment of the first 2020 economic support payment, section 65JB Payment of the second 2020 economic support payment

Nil rate, waiting periods, suspended & backdating provisions

Those whose rate of FTB is legislatively greater than nil on any of the eligibility days are taken to be receiving a qualifying payment and qualify for a 2020 ESP.

A person who is not receiving FTB on an eligibility day does not qualify for a 2020 ESP with FTB. However, if the person subsequently commences to receive FTB in respect of an eligibility day, for example, they are granted a FTB via a lump sum claim, the person qualifies for a 2020 ESP.

A person whose instalment claim for FTB is subsequently granted and backdated for a period that includes an eligibility day, with the result that the person is receiving FTB on an eligibility day, qualifies for a 2020 ESP provided they have not already received a 2020 ESP with another payment.

Limiting date

The first 2020 ESP will not be paid on or beyond 1 July 2022. However, where a person is granted an extension to make an FTB lump sum claim due to special circumstances and this claim is processed after 30 June 2022, a 2020 ESP can still be made on or after 1 July 2022.

The second 2020 ESP will not be paid on or beyond 1 July 2023. However, where a person is granted an extension to make an FTB lump sum claim due to special circumstances and this claim is processed after 30 June 2023, a 2020 ESP can still be made on or after 1 July 2023.

1.1.V.13 Voluntary child support

Definition

Voluntary child support is child support (

1.1.C.20

) that is paid by a person who does not have a child support liability (

1.1.C.21

). Any child support paid during the 13-week period of grace to take maintenance action is counted as maintenance income as part of the maintenance income test.

Example:

Craig and Fiona have separated. Fiona has care of their 2 children. Craig agrees to pay Fiona $200 per fortnight as voluntary child support until his liability is assessed by Child Support. In the absence of an assessed liability, the full amount Craig pays is assessed under the maintenance income test. Once his liability has been assessed by Child Support, Craig is required to pay the amount as assessed by Child Support.

4.2.3.10 Restrictions on determining FTB claims

Summary

If an effective (

1.1.E.10

) claim for

FTB

has been made, the claim must be determined. However there are some situations where an effective claim can be made, but it cannot be determined. This topic outlines the restrictions that apply to determining an FTB claim.

Restrictions on determining FTB claims

If any conditions in the table below are met, the action outlined in column 2 must be taken. If none of the conditions are met, the claim can be determined.

Determination condition

If condition is met see …

Individual (

1.1.A.72

If the claim is made by an individual (

1.1.I.90

) for a past period, and

the past period falls in an income year before the income year in which the claim is made

the individual and/or their partner is required to lodge an income tax return for the year in which the past period falls, and

on the date of the claim, an assessment of their taxable income (

1.1.T.20

) has not been made for that year.

Explanation:

A past period claim lodged in the year following an entitlement year, cannot be based on the individual's estimated income for that year where a tax return is required to be lodged.

Note:

The individual's partner will also need to lodge a tax return, where required by the ATO.

the past period falls in the income year in which the claim is made, and

the claim is not determined until the following income year,

the entitlement is assessed on the estimate of income provided by the individual if information about the individual's amount of

ATI

is unavailable.

Example:

Dana lodges a past period claim for FTB on 26 June following the birth of her child on 1 May. Dana's FTB claim is not determined until the following income year, on 2 July. If Dana was not required to lodge an income tax return for that income year at the time of lodgement, the FTB claim can be determined on an estimate of income provided by Dana for the income year.

4.2 Claims for FTB

Types of claim

There are 3 main types of claims for

FTB

:

past period claim (

1.1.P.60

)

bereavement claim (

1.1.B.20

), and

instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

).

A claim for FTB can include any combination of these claim types, but separate claim forms do not have to be lodged, provided the individual has provided all the necessary information in the claim to make the determination for each type of claim and the claim relates to one financial year.

One common claim scenario is a combination of past period claim and instalment claim where the individual becomes eligible for FTB prior to lodging the claim. The past period claim is paid out as a lump sum and ongoing entitlement is paid as instalments.

Example:

Judy has a baby in August and lodges their FTB claim 6 weeks later. Judy is eligible for FTB from the day the baby is born. Judy's entitlement is determined as a past period claim from the baby's

DOB

up to the date the claim is lodged, and as an instalment claim from the date the claim is lodged. The administrative process involved in the 2 claims is not apparent to Judy. When Judy's FTB is paid, they receive a lump sum for the 6-week period prior to the date of the claim and fortnightly FTB instalments from the date of the claim (including arrears from the date the claim was lodged to the date the claim was granted).

If an individual is claiming for a past period in a previous financial year and the current financial year, they need to lodge a past period claim for the period in the previous year and an instalment claim (which will include the past period) for the current financial year.

Example:

Judy has a baby on 3 May 2024 and lodges their FTB claim on 9 September 2024. Judy needs to lodge a lump sum claim for the period 3 May to 30 June 2024. Centrelink determines Judy’s entitlement for the period in the 2023-24 income year when Judy’s (and her partner’s, if applicable)

ATI

for that income year is confirmed by the

ATO

or, if Judy and/or her partner are not required to lodge an income tax return for the 2023-24 income year, once they have notified Centrelink of their ATI for that income year.

Judy also needs to lodge an instalment claim for their ongoing entitlement. Judy’s entitlement is determined from 1 July to 8 September 2024 as a past period, and as an instalment claim from 9 September 2024 when the claim was lodged.

Individuals can lodge a claim for FTB up to 97 days before the expected day on which a child will become an FTB child of the individual (a pre-claim). Pre-claims may also be lodged for

PLP

.

Example:

Judy is due to have a baby in February. Judy may submit a pre-claim for FTB and/or PLP 97 days before the baby's expected due date. Judy's entitlement for any of the payments will be determined after the baby is born and once Judy has provided any additional required information to Centrelink. However, Judy may choose to wait until the baby is born to make a claim.

If a person is receiving FTB by instalments and claims FTB for an additional child (for example, a newborn child) this is a variation to the individual's rate of FTB and the date of effect provisions relating to changes to non-income related circumstances are applied.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.4.2.10

Change in non-income related circumstances

Lodgement timeframe

Individuals have 12 months after the relevant income year (

1.1.I.75

) to lodge a past period claim for that income year.

Example:

Vicki wants to lodge a past period claim for the 2023-24 financial year. She has 12 months after the income year to lodge the claim. Therefore, she has until 30 June 2025 to lodge her claim.

The claim lodgement timeframe may be extended if special circumstances have prevented an individual from lodging a past period claim by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

). However, any extension provided must end no later than the end of the second income year after the relevant income year.

4.2.4.110 Claim action 11 - ATO advises Services Australia no TFN

Is a letter required?

Yes.

Content of the letter

Advise the individual (

1.1.A.72

) that their claim cannot be determined without the

TFN

details for the TFN claim person (

1.1.T.50

).

Explanation:

The TFN claim person or substitution person:

has not made an application for a TFN

has been refused a TFN

has withdrawn a TFN application, or

does not have a TFN.

Failure to provide these details stops the claim from being effective (

1.1.E.10

).

The individual should be advised that an ineffective claim cannot be reinstated by Services Australia, and they must lodge a new claim if they want to test their eligibility for

FTB

in the future.

Record-keeping

An electronic or paper file record of this advice should be kept.

3.1.1.32 Sharing FTB in blended families

Introduction

This topic discusses the impact of the Child Support Scheme Reforms for blended families.

Sharing

FTB

From 1 July 2008, FTB cannot be shared between members of a blended family for the same child. This means where both members of the family would otherwise be eligible for FTB for one or more children at the same time, only one member would be eligible for payment. The Secretary would determine which member is eligible for the payment based on which member is the primary carer and whether there is an agreement nominating one member to receive the payment.

Circumstances in which FTB may be shared

FTB may however be shared between members of a couple in a blended family where they have care of at least 2 FTB children and:

one child is from a previous relationship of one member of the couple, and

the other is a child either from the other partner's previous relationship, or

the child is a child of the couple's current relationship.

Example:

Mary and Fred have 2 FTB children, John and Sarah. John is from Mary's previous relationship, and Sarah is a child of Mary and Fred's current relationship. Both Mary and Fred may be eligible for FTB for the children, and the Secretary may determine Mary and Fred's percentages of FTB for the children.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 26 Only 1 member of a couple eligible for FTB, section 28 Eligibility for FTB of members of a couple in a blended family, section 60 Sharing FTB between members of a couple in a blended family

Pre 1 July 2008 rules for sharing FTB in blended families

Prior to 1 July 2008, the total FTB payment could be shared between both members of a blended family couple. If each member of a couple in a blended family wanted to be paid FTB separately, a determination to share FTB between them could be made. The total amount of FTB payable for the family was calculated, and then each person was paid a percentage of the total amount. This was regardless of how many immediate children (

1.1.B.30

) each person had - the payment was not calculated on a per child basis. Each child in a blended family was taken to be an FTB child of both members of the couple.

The couple had to nominate the percentage of FTB they each wanted to receive. If they could not agree, the total rate of FTB was divided by the number of immediate FTB children of each individual.

7.2.8 Effect of bankruptcy on debt recovery

Summary

This section provides information about the effect of a debtor becoming bankrupt on continuing efforts to recover a debt (

1.1.D.60

). It includes:

effect of bankruptcy on debt

recovery action as a creditor

debt becoming irrecoverable at law

debts due to fraud may still be recoverable, and

repayment of money recovered after debtor becomes bankrupt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 95 Secretary may write off debt

Policy reference:

FA Guide

7.3.1

Writing-off a debt

Effect of bankruptcy on debt

Entering into bankruptcy does not eliminate a debt. The debt however, ceases to be due and payable for the duration of the bankruptcy.

Taking recovery action as a creditor

If there is a bankruptcy notice in place, Centrelink may take bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor by filing a Creditor's Petition in the Federal Court. This action should only be taken if, to repay the debt, the debtor has:

property, or

access to funds that can be used.

As an alternative to entering into bankruptcy, a debtor may enter into an arrangement under the

Bankruptcy Act 1966

Part IX or Part X. A Part IX agreement is an agreement between the debtor and their creditors. An arrangement under Part X can be:

a composition

a deed of arrangement, or

a deed of assignment.

While an arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act Part IX or Part X is in place, no action should be taken to recover the debt by deductions. Centrelink may receive money from the debtor however, as a party to the arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act. If a Part IX or a Part X arrangement is in place or is proposed, specific advice should be sought from

DSS

on what action to take in the individual circumstances of the case.

Debt becomes irrecoverable at law

Once a person has been discharged from bankruptcy, a debt under the

FA

law becomes irrecoverable at law and is written off if the debt:

arose before the date of bankruptcy, and

was not incurred by fraud.

Debt incurred by fraud

The Bankruptcy Act subsection 153(2)(b) does not release a former bankrupt from debts incurred through fraud. A debt incurred by fraud is not specifically irrecoverable under the FA(Admin)Act, as the onus is on the debtor to prove that the debt did not occur because of fraud.

Not all debts that were incurred by fraud will still be recoverable after a bankruptcy has been discharged.

Explanation:

The circumstances of each case must be considered to determine whether the debt is fraudulent for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.

When there appears to be enough evidence to establish a case of fraud, it should be referred to DSS for specific advice as to whether the debt will remain recoverable after the debtor is discharged from bankruptcy.

Repayment of money recovered by deductions

Once a person is declared bankrupt, deductions cannot be made from their FA payments to recover the debt that arose before the date of bankruptcy.

Explanation:

The FA(Admin)Act requires that a debt be 'due' to the Commonwealth in order to be recoverable. A debt ceases to be due and payable for the duration of a bankruptcy.

If deductions have been made from FA payments of a bankrupt person, money recovered during the period of the bankruptcy for a debt that occurred before bankruptcy should be refunded directly to the individual.

If money was recovered by means of deductions by consent from the FA of a person who is not the debtor, the money should be repaid to the person from whose payments it was deducted.

Repayment of money recovered by legal proceedings

A complex situation arises when money has been recovered from a bankrupt by way of legal proceedings. This situation should rarely arise, as any legal proceedings should be discontinued once a debtor enters into bankruptcy. Cases involving recovery in these circumstances should be referred to DSS for specific advice.

Repayment of money recovered by garnishee

If a garnishee notice (

1.1.G.10

) has been issued against a bankrupt person, money recovered during the period of the bankruptcy should be refunded.

If money was recovered by a garnishee notice issued in respect of the debtor's income, the money should be repaid directly to the person who was issued the garnishee notice, or to the individual.

Recovered money should be repaid to the trustee in bankruptcy, if it was recovered by:

a garnishee notice issued in respect of the debtor's property, and the property is subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, or

instalments under FA(Admin)Act section 91.

If the money was recovered by a garnishee notice issued in respect of the debtor's property, and that property is not subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, the money should be repaid directly to the individual.

Example:

A personal injury settlement.

1.1.E.25 Enrolment (CCS)

Definition

A child can be enrolled for care by an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

) in 1 of 4 ways:

the approved provider of the service and the parent/guardian (or their partner (

1.1.P.30

)) of the child enter into an

CWA

the service provides care to a child at risk of serious abuse or neglect, and the approved provider is not able to identify an individual (

1.1.I.90

) who is eligible for

ACCS

(child wellbeing), so the provider makes itself eligible in respect of the child

the approved provider of the service and the parent/guardian (or their partner) of the child enter into a relevant arrangement (

4.13.2.20

), or

the approved provider of the service and an organisation, such as the parent’s employer, enter into an arrangement (

4.13.2.30

).

Only a CWA and provider eligible arrangement are eligible for subsidy. Relevant arrangements and arrangements with an organisation are not eligible to receive any subsidy.

An enrolment can cease in 1 of 3 ways:

where a child is enrolled under a CWA, relevant arrangement, or arrangement with an organisation, and the arrangement ends (for example, where an end date has been agreed to by the relevant parties)

where a service provides care to a child at risk of serious abuse or neglect in the circumstances described above, those circumstances no longer apply (the child is no longer at risk and/or the provider has been able to identify an individual who is eligible for ACCS (child wellbeing)), or

a child has not attended any of the service's sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) for 14 continuous weeks. Enrolments are automatically ceased by the

CCSS

if this occurs.

Enrolment notices

When a child is enrolled for care by an approved child care service, the approved provider of the service must submit an enrolment notice to the CCSS through their third party software program or the Provider Entry Point.

An enrolment notice is the mechanism that links a child, parent/guardian, and provider/service in the CCSS. It also both enables and requires the provider to submit session reports (

1.1.S.35

) in relation to care provided to the child. If an arrangement for care includes more than one child (for example, siblings from the same family), the provider must create an enrolment for each child, which reflects that child's care arrangement.

3.1.7.13 Capitalised maintenance

Summary

This topic provides information about capitalised maintenance, and how it is assessed under the maintenance income test for

FTB

Part A. It covers the following:

explanation of capitalised maintenance

assessment of capitalised maintenance, and

payer dies during the capitalisation period.

Note:

Capitalised maintenance made under court orders or agreements finalised before 1 July 2008 will continue to be assessed under the rules outlined in this topic.

Explanation of capitalised maintenance

Capitalised maintenance income is income provided by a:

lump sum cash payment, or

transfer or settlement of property (see example).

Example:

A home, car or business.

Only the part specified as being provided as maintenance for a payee (

1.1.P.71

) or a child is assessed. If none of the amount is specified as maintenance, no amount is assessed. An individual with an informal child support agreement, rather than a court order or written agreement must nominate the percentage of a capitalised amount that is for maintenance.

Example:

A court order involves the payer (

1.1.P.72

) transferring part of their share in the former family home to the payee. The total value transferred was $40,000, half of which was specified as maintenance. The amount assessed as capitalised maintenance income is $20,000.

Assessment stops at the end of the capitalisation period. The assessment does not change if the capitalised maintenance is spent or disposed of in any other way before the period ends.

Assessing capitalised maintenance income

Capitalised maintenance income is converted to an annualised rate of maintenance income by working out each person's share of the total amount, then working out the equivalent annualised income the person's share represents, as if it had been received over the entire capitalisation period.

The child support order or agreement may state the amount apportioned to each person. In any case, the total amount is apportioned between the children in the case.

Example:

The following table shows an example of apportioning $30,000.

If the $30,000 is for …

the amount is apportioned as …

the payee and 2 children

$15,000 for each child.

2 children only

$15,000 for each child.

Capitalisation period

The capitalisation period is the period for which the maintenance is paid. This will generally be given in the terms of the child support order or agreement. The capitalisation period given in a court order or agreement may be varied by Services Australia if it is clear that the period is not appropriate for the circumstances of the case.

If the capitalisation period is not given in a court order or agreement, the period is taken to be the period stated by the payee. The following table shows when the capitalisation period is reduced in some situations.

When the capitalisation period is not specified in an order or agreement …

then the capitalisation period is …

and the maintenance is child maintenance and the FTB child is less than 18 years old when the payment was received

the period beginning on the day the payment was received, and ending the day before the child turns 18.

and the maintenance is spousal maintenance, and the payee is less than 65 years old when the payment was received

the period beginning on the day the payment was received, and ending the day before the parent turns 65.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24 Apportionment of capitalised maintenance income

Calculating the assessable amount

The following table shows how the amount of capitalised maintenance is assessed for the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) during the financial year.

Step

Action

1

Work out the amount attributable for the financial year using the following formula:

Capitalised maintenance income × Relevant period ÷ Capitalisation period.

2

Work out the annualised amount for the financial year using the following formula:

Result from Step 1 × Number of days in the financial year ÷ Number of days in the capitalisation period in the financial year.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 24 Apportionment of capitalised maintenance income

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.30

Application of the maintenance income test

Payer dies during the capitalisation period

If the payer dies during the period that the capitalised maintenance covers, there is no change to the assessment of the capitalised maintenance under the maintenance income test.

Explanation:

The capitalised maintenance income definition is met at the time the payment is received by the individual, and the payer is alive at the time.

Example:

Carol receives $100,000 capitalised maintenance under the terms of a court order. The order specifies that the $100,000 applies for a period of 10 years. Under the maintenance income test, $10,000 is assessed per year. Carol's ex-husband dies after 5 years. The assessment of the capitalised maintenance does not change and it continues to be assessed for the whole 10-year period.

4.14 Claims for SIFS

Introduction

Note:

SIFS

has been closed to new recipients since 1 July 2017. Grandfathering arrangements permit eligible recipients with entitlement to SIFS as at 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS as long as they remain continuously eligible for the payment. See

2.11.1

.

Individuals who receive

FTB

will be automatically assessed under the SIFS review process (

6.7

) once FTB reconciliation conditions have been met (

6.4

), without the need for a specific claim.

Individuals who receive FTB for part of the relevant year will automatically be assessed for SIFS eligibility during this period (

6.7

), once the FTB reconciliation conditions have been met. If the individual continues to have a SIFS qualifying child (

2.11.2

) in their care for the part of the relevant income year that they did not receive FTB, they may submit a separate claim for this period after the end of the income year.

Individuals who do not receive FTB for any part of a relevant income year, but who have a SIFS qualifying child in their care during the income year, may submit a claim after the end of the income year.

The appropriate rate of SIFS will be paid to the individual where the family meets both the primary and secondary earner income tests (and all other eligibility criteria) (

2.11.1

).

A SIFS claim for an income year must be made after the end of that income year, and before the end of the following income year. For example, if an eligible individual with a SIFS qualifying child receiving an 'at home' rate of

YA

wishes to claim SIFS for the 2023-24 income year, they must lodge their claim before 30 June 2025.

2.6.2.30 CCS - immunisation approved exemptions

Summary

This topic explains the approved exemptions for an individual (

1.1.I.90

) to meet the immunisation requirements (

1.1.I.10

) for

CCS

and the evidence required.

The following recognised immunisation providers (

1.1.R.09

) are eligible to certify that a child is medically contraindicated or that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity:

a general practitioner (

1.1.G.12

)

a paediatrician

a public health physician

an infectious diseases physician, or

a clinical immunologist.

Approved exemptions from immunisation

A child has an approved exemption from CCS immunisation requirements where the:

child has a medical contraindication

child has natural immunity

child is a part of an approved vaccine study

vaccine is temporarily unavailable

child is vaccinated overseas, or

Secretary has determined that the child is exempt.

Medical contraindication

Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has a medical contraindication to the vaccination.

Example:

A child who suffers from anaphylaxis following a previous dose of the relevant vaccine. If so, a recognised immunisation provider may certify that immunisation is medically contraindicated on the approved form.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Natural immunity

Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity.

Generally, a natural immunity exemption will only be applied to a specific antigen (not the whole schedule). A natural immunity exemption should be applied for life (based on the clinical assessment of a recognised immunisation provider).

Example:

A child who has previously contracted measles may have developed a natural immunity to contracting the disease again and therefore, does not need to be immunised against measles again.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Approved vaccine study

A child meets the immunisation requirements if the child is a participant in a vaccine study approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee registered with the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Temporary unavailability of vaccine

Where a child is not vaccinated as required and the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that the relevant vaccine/s (or all vaccines) are temporarily unavailable, the child is considered to meet the immunisation requirements, provided the child has received all other relevant vaccinations. A child meets the immunisation requirements on this basis only until the vaccine becomes available.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(4) Temporary unavailability of vaccine

Child vaccinated overseas

A child who was vaccinated overseas can meet the Australian early childhood vaccination schedule (birth to 4 years), when a recognised immunisation provider confirms the child has the same level of immunisation, by recording the details on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR).

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(5) Child vaccinated overseas

Secretary may determine a child meets immunisation requirements

The table below details circumstances where the Secretary can determine a child meets the immunisation requirements.

Exception/exemption

Circumstances

Refusal of consent to vaccination

the child is in the care of an individual under a state or territory child welfare law and neither the individual nor their partner has legal authority to make decisions about the medical treatment of the child, and

if the child is aged under 14 years, the person with legal authority to make decisions about the medical treatment of the child has refused or failed within a reasonable timeframe, to provide consent to the individual taking actions to enable the child to meet the immunisation requirements, or

if the child is aged at least 14 years, the child has refused, or failed within a reasonable time, to provide consent to the individual taking actions to enable the child to meet the usual immunisation requirements.

Note:

Where biological parents of the child/ren are separated and there is a court order in place that includes a clause stating both parents are unable to vaccinate their child/ren without agreement from the other parent an exemption from immunisation may be approved with evidence. If the biological parents of the child/ren are separated and there is no court order in place, either parent may exercise their parental responsibilities, either independently or jointly, regarding making medical decisions such as choosing to vaccinate.

Risk of family violence (

1.1.F.15

)

taking action to meet the immunisation requirements would result in the child, the individual who has care of the child or a member of the immediate family of the individual or the child being at risk of family violence.

Child would be at increased risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect

the parent or carer is not eligible for CCS

the child does not meet the immunisation requirements, or their immunisation status is unknown, and

the provider believes the child would be at increased risk of serious abuse or neglect if the child does not get access to the subsidy.

Permanent humanitarian visa holder

the individual is a permanent humanitarian visa holder and has not had the opportunity to immunise their child.

Note:

An exemption under this category can only be applied for a maximum period of 6 months after the child first enters Australia. When the exemption ends the customer will be placed into a grace period if they are still not up to date.

Unacceptable risk of harm to child or another person

a listed medical practitioner (

1.1.L.28

) has certified in writing that immunisation of the child would result in an unacceptable risk of physical harm to the child or a person administering a vaccination to the child, and

the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that they agree with the listed medical practitioner.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(6) Secretary's decision

Family Assistance (Immunisation Principles and Vaccination Schedules) (DSS) Determination 2018

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.3.20

CCS immunisation requirements

Evidence required to determine exemption

The table below explains the required evidence to determine whether an individual has an exemption from immunisation.

Exemption circumstance

Evidence required

Medical contraindication

Natural immunity

Medical contraindication or natural immunity certified by a recognised immunisation provider through the AIR site or on the AIR Immunisation medical exemption form (IM011).

Approved vaccine study

A signed letter, from the researchers which verifies that the child is a participant of a vaccine study, and

evidence that the study is approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee registered with the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Temporary unavailability of vaccine

The Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer must certify in writing that a vaccine, or all vaccines, are temporarily unavailable.

Child vaccinated overseas

A child who was vaccinated in another country meets the immunisation requirements if a recognised immunisation provider completes and signs the Australian Immunisation Register immunisation history form (IM013) for the vaccines administered overseas and provides a signed letter detailing the vaccines received.

Refusal of consent to vaccination

evidence of a formal or informal care arrangement between the primary carer and the individual with legal authority to vaccinate the child to show proof of care

if the child is aged under 14 years

evidence that the individual with legal authority to vaccinate the child does not give authority for the child to be vaccinated, or evidence that authority has not been provided within a reasonable timeframe (for example, statutory declaration from carer and letter from authority that the person with legal authority has not provided consent), or

if the child is aged 14 years or over

evidence that the child does not consent or has not given consent in a reasonable timeframe to being immunised (for example, statutory declaration from carer or a letter from a recognised immunisation provider that the child has refused).

Risk of family violence

individuals must be referred to a Centrelink social worker and each case will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Applicable documentation is to be determined by the Centrelink social worker.

Child would be at increased risk of serious abuse or neglect

an approved provider's (

1.1.A.90

) eligibility for

ACCS

(child wellbeing) is being assessed (

4.13.2.40

), and

an application in the form and manner deemed appropriate by the Secretary will be required in support of an exemption.

Permanent humanitarian visa holder

An eligibility assessment is determined when the Department of Home Affairs data link is established for the child. This is generally established by Refugee and Asylum Seeker (RAS) Service Officers during new claim interview.

The system will automatically apply a Secretary determination exemption to the customer's record:

when a customer's claim is submitted, and

both the customer and child satisfy Humanitarian Visa subclass and

FTB

eligibility requirements, which includes

care of the child, and

correct visa subclass category

Unacceptable risk of harm to the child or a person administering the vaccination

a listed medical practitioner (

1.1.M.40

) has certified in writing, on an approved form, that immunisation of the child would result in an unacceptable risk of physical harm to the child or a person administering a vaccination to the child, and

the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that he or she agrees with the listed medical practitioner.

Note:

A recipient (

1.1.R.07

) can seek referral to a listed medical practitioner through a general practitioner or a state or territory health department.

4.1.3.10 Payment nominees

Protection of individual's interests

Generally, an individual who wants their

FA

payments, including advance payments, to go to another person on an ongoing basis can request the appointment of a 'payment nominee'. Centrelink should consider the circumstances and wishes of the individual and other avenues of payments to a third party to ensure that the proposed payment nominee arrangement is the most appropriate arrangement for the individual.

In practice, an individual who is eligible for

FTB

is unlikely to be in a situation where payment should be directed to a nominee for their instalment payments. If a nominee is needed, it is likely that the individual is unable to provide enough care for a child to meet the FTB child eligibility requirements, or Centrelink has appointed a payment nominee due to the issuing of a security notice (

4.4.10

).

To appoint a payment nominee (other than in relation to a security notice), the individual should complete the relevant form. The nominee is required to indicate their acceptance of the appointment and their duties under FA law via written consent. Centrelink must send Letters confirming the nominee appointment to both the individual and the nominee.

An appropriate payment nominee is not limited to being an individual. It can be a community organisation or body corporate. When appointing a nominee, Centrelink should:

investigate what individual or organisation might be the most appropriate payment nominee in the circumstances, and

obtain any necessary information that may be needed to make this assessment (this includes making the individual aware of the intention to appoint a nominee).

If a case involves a child of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander group or a refugee child, then a social worker should be involved and consult with:

an

ISO

on any relevant cultural issues, or

an

MSO

to identify any relevant cultural factors.

The Secretary may suspend or cancel the appointed payment nominee at any time.

Act reference:

Security notice issued

The wishes of the individual

Centrelink must also take into consideration the wishes (if any) of the individual, which may include the consent of the individual, before appointing a person as the individual’s payment nominee, except where the nominee is being appointed as a result of a security notice. Although the individual’s consent is not strictly required, whenever there is any question of the individual's capability to express their wishes or consent to the appointment of a nominee, or any concerns as to an existing arrangement, Centrelink must investigate the situation further. Where the individual is deemed incapable of expressing their wishes or providing consent (other than in relation to a security notice), Centrelink must obtain documentary evidence to support any decision to appoint a nominee.

There may be times where an individual is not capable, for example due to an intellectual/physical constraint, of expressing their wishes or providing consent to the appointment of a nominee. In these cases, Centrelink may appoint a nominee on behalf of the individual with attention to supporting evidence and where Centrelink is fully satisfied that the nominee is required and will act in the individual's best interests. The decision made by Centrelink to appoint a nominee in these circumstances must be fully documented.

Where an individual has a psychiatric disability, a nominee can be appointed where there is a court-appointed arrangement such as a Guardianship Order provided by a Mental Health Tribunal.

Where an individual is subject to a security notice

Where an individual is subject to a security notice (

4.4.10

), Centrelink may appoint a payment nominee and direct that any FA payments be made to the payment nominee.

In such situations, the Centrelink is not required to consider the wishes of the individual when appointing the payment nominee.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 57GI(5) For the purposes of subsection (4), paragraph 219TD(2)(b) …, section 57GI(6) For the purposes of subsection (4), section 219TN …

FA(Admin)Act

section 219TD Provisions relating to appointments, section 219TN Duty of nominee to principal

Evidence of incapability

To decide whether an individual is incapable of expressing their wishes in relation to the appointment of a nominee, Centrelink must have sufficient evidence.

Examples

of what may contribute to evidence may be:

reliable medical evidence on file

recent certification by a medical practitioner

reliable documentation or order officially appointing a guardian or administrator, such as a Public Trustee or Guardianship Board, or

some other authoritative source, such as a social work report.

Other arrangements

There are some instances where the appointment of a nominee may not be the most appropriate option to meet the best interests of the individual.

When responding to a third party requesting information regarding the individual's payments, it may be more appropriate to consider the release of information under implied consent arrangements rather than by appointing a nominee.

Example:

An individual is in a coma and someone needs to obtain information about their payment details on their behalf. A hospital social worker calls Centrelink in an attempt to obtain the information. It may be appropriate in this case for a Centrelink worker to disclose the individual's payment details to the hospital worker.

3.1.5.50 Reasonable maintenance action completed - Child Support collect

Summary

This topic provides information about satisfying the

MAT

(

3.1.5

), in the context of Child Support collection of maintenance (

1.1.M.10

). Topics discussed include:

maintenance action completed

changing private collect to Child Support collect, and

ending Child Support collection and electing to end collection of arrears.

This topic does not discuss notional assessments. Please refer to topics

1.1.N.45

and

3.1.7.14

for discussion of notional assessments.

For guidance on collection of maintenance from a payer who is a resident overseas refer to

3.1.5.80

.

Maintenance action completed

Maintenance action has been completed when the individual:

has a registered child support assessment with Child Support

has a registered child support agreement with Child Support (

3.1.5.55

), or

has taken appropriate action in a reciprocating jurisdiction to obtain maintenance (

3.1.5.80

).

For guidance on whether maintenance action has been completed where an individual has a child support agreement in relation to which there is a notional assessment, refer to

3.1.7.14

.

Changing private collect to Child Support collect

After transferring from private collect to Child Support collect, the individual should advise Centrelink of periods for which Child Support will attempt to collect arrears and also the actual amounts of child support privately collected for these periods.

Child Support can generally only collect any child support liability not met for the period 3 months immediately prior to the transfer. In exceptional circumstances this period may be up to 9 months.

Ending Child Support collection & electing to end collection of arrears

Where an individual opts to change from Child Support collect to private collect, they can elect to collect any arrears of child support owing to them. This has the effect of discharging Child Support from the responsibility for collecting the arrears. Instead the individual is responsible for collecting the arrears, either under a private arrangement or through the court. Electing to end the collection of arrears from Child Support collection does not waive entitlement to the arrears.

Where an individual discharges Child Support from the responsibility for collecting arrears, Child Support will notify Centrelink of the date that Child Support collect no longer applies. For the subsequent period of private collect, the deemed amount would include the arrears for the purpose of the maintenance income test (MIT), regardless of whether the individual:

takes no action to collect the arrears

is successful in collecting the arrears, or

is unsuccessful in collecting the arrears.

If the individual is unsuccessful in collecting the arrears they should be advised that it would be in their interest to seek legal advice to obtain the arrears.

In the case of a partial or full exemption, the deemed amount may not include the arrears where it is determined that it is not reasonable to collect these arrears. If the individual has a partial exemption, the amount assessed under the MIT should be the amount the individual is actually collecting. If at a later date, the individual collects the non-paid child support assessment amount, the amount received will need to be included in the MIT in the year it is actually received.

2.1.1.80 FTB in blended families

Summary

Generally, only one member of a couple is eligible to receive

FTB

. Where both members of a couple would otherwise be eligible for FTB for one or more children at the same time, only one member would be eligible for payment. The Secretary may determine which member of the couple is eligible for the payment if there is no agreement between the couple on who should receive the payment.

FTB may however be shared between members of a couple in a blended family situation where they have care of at least 2 FTB children and:

one child is from a previous relationship of one member of the couple, and

the other is a child either from the other partner's previous relationship, or

the child is a child of the couple's current relationship.

Example:

Mary and Fred have 2 FTB children, John and Sarah. John is from Mary's previous relationship and Sarah is a child of Mary and Fred's current relationship. Both Mary and Fred may be eligible to receive payment for the child for whom they are responsible.

Note:

The Secretary cannot make a determination for a past period if one or both members of the couple have already been paid FTB for the period.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 26 Only 1 member of a couple eligible for FTB, section 27 Extension of meaning of FTB or regular care child in a blended family case, section 28 Eligibility for FTB of members of a couple in a blended family, section 60 Sharing FTB between members of a couple in a blended family

6.4.3.60 Removal of prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Summary

Where an individual has one or more outstanding

FTB

non-lodger decisions due to the individual and/or their partner not lodging their tax returns or failing to notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, their non-lodger status will need to be resolved, or the non-lodger debt/s arising from these non-lodger decision/s fully repaid, before the individual can receive FTB by fortnightly instalments again.

Removal of the prohibition

A prohibition on being paid FTB based on an estimate can be removed if the individual and/or their partner lodges the outstanding income tax return/s, or notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, or fully repay all outstanding non-lodger debts (or a combination of all 3) for all entitlement years for which there was a non-lodger decision.

Where an individual's partner has also been subject to a prohibition on FTB based on an estimate due to the individual's failure to lodge an income tax return and/or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, or fully repay any non-lodger debt by the end of the grace period, the prohibition will be removed from the partner when the individual is no longer subject to prohibition, or if the couple separates.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AA Non-payment of FTB for non-lodgement of tax returns, section 32AB Prohibited periods for claimant, section 32AC Prohibited periods for relevant partner, section 32AD Prohibited periods for new partner

Recommencement of FTB based on an estimate

Upon the removal of the prohibition, the individual will automatically recommence receiving FTB based on an estimate. Individuals will be notified in writing that the prohibition has been lifted and their requirement to notify Centrelink if their circumstances have changed since last receiving FTB based on an estimate.

Back payment of FTB

Individuals who have their FTB non-lodger decisions resolved may be able to receive any unpaid entitlement of FTB (amount not paid during the period of a prohibition) on the prohibition ending. This may include unpaid FTB for the lapsed part of the entitlement year in which the prohibition is lifted, and the entitlement year immediately prior. These periods can be paid based on current income estimates of the individual (and their partner, if applicable). For years prior to this, FTB can still be paid once the individual (and their partner where applicable) have lodged their tax returns or have notified Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return. Where income is confirmed after late lodgement of income tax return/s and/or late notification of ATI, these periods can be paid based on the recalculated amount (excluding FTB supplements), or the amount that the individual was entitled to be paid before the non-lodger determination was made, whichever of the 2 is less.

Offsetting of FTB once prohibition lifted

Upon the removal of a prohibition, any amount of FTB paid for previous year/s entitlement that was withheld due to the prohibition may be set-off against any outstanding

FA

debts.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 84A Setting off family assistance against debt owed, section 32AB Prohibited periods for claimant, section 28 Variation of instalment and past period entitlement determinations where income tax return not lodged

1.1.N.15 Nights in care (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of assessing a pattern of care for

FTB

, an individual (

1.1.I.90

) has the care of a child on a given night if:

a care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

) specifies that the individual has the care of the child for that night and the individuals sharing the care of the child are complying with the care arrangement, or

a care arrangement is not being complied with and an interim period (

1.1.I.105

) applies. An interim period may apply where the care arrangement specifies that the individual has care of the child for a specific night and the other individual that is sharing care of the child is not complying with the care arrangement. However, interim periods can only apply in certain circumstances. For more information, please see

2.1.1.70

.

If there is no care arrangement that specifies the care arrangement for that night, or the care arrangement has been departed from by one or other of the individuals sharing care of the child and an interim period is not in effect in relation to the care of the child, the child is considered to be in an individual's care on that night if the child is in the physical care of the individual overnight.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 35J Working out actual care, and extent of care, of a child, section 3(1)-'care arrangement'

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.25

Shared care of an FTB child,

2.1.1.50

Determining percentage of care,

2.1.1.70

Disputed care arrangements

Nights in care may not necessarily reflect a pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

)

If counting the number of nights where an individual has the care of a child overnight does not reflect the pattern of care for the child, then Centrelink may take into account the actual pattern of care for the child.

Example:

Peter and Brad have 2 young children. They have separated, but do not have a care arrangement. Brad works part-time from home. Peter works full-time. They have agreed on a pattern of care that allows them both substantial time with the children. The children sleep at Peter's home every night, and spend all day Monday to Friday with Brad.

Brad would not be eligible for FTB for his children if his pattern of care was assessed only on the basis of nights in care. However, as Brad cares for his children 12 hours a day, 5 days a week, both parents would be encouraged to put in place a care arrangement that apportions care between them. If there is no care arrangement, Centrelink may take into account the established pattern of care to arrive at a split between the parents.

All rates shown are fortnightly unless indicated otherwise.

Note:

Some of the rates listed may have changed or ceased.

Table 1: Maximum standard rate of FTB Part A

The maximum rate of FTB Part A is payable where family income is equal to or less than the income free area for the relevant income year. FTB Part A reduces by 20c for each dollar of family income above the lower income free area until the base rate of FTB Part A is reached.

Note:

The

Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Promoting Sustainable Welfare) Act 2018

implemented a consistent 30c in the dollar income test taper for FTB Part A with family income in excess of the higher income free area from 1 July 2019.

The FTB Part A supplement is a component of the annual maximum FTB Part A rate and is paid after reconciliation. The supplement is not paid by instalment and is therefore not included in the fortnightly rates.

4.1.1.50 TFN requirements for SIFS

TFN

requirements

SIFS

cannot be paid until the individual applying for the payment provides a TFN statement (

4.1.1.10

).

If the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

), or was a member of a couple at any time during the claim period, they must provide their partner's (and any previous partner's) TFN statement.

If the individual does not claim

FTB

, although they have a SIFS qualifying child (

2.11.2

), SIFS can still be paid if they (and their partner and/or any previous partners) provide TFN statements.

An individual is generally given 28 days to satisfy the TFN requirements. If they fail to provide a TFN statement their claim is taken not to have been made (that is, the claim would be ineffective).

Declining to provide a TFN statement is not an offence, but the applicant's SIFS claim may not be effective or their SIFS payment may cease to be payable if a TFN statement is not provided.

5.1.1.10 Power to obtain information

Introduction

An authorised officer (

1.1.O.10

) may request a person (

1.1.P.80

) to provide information or documents, which may be required to:

establish whether an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is eligible to be paid

FA

(

1.1.F.02

)

calculate the rate (percentage for

CCS

) to be paid, or

establish whether an individual or any other person to whom FA was paid was entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to the payment.

Example:

Information required may include:

name and

DOB

address

income details

evidence of child's enrolment in, or completion of, courses of study

evidence relating to the child's capacity for study, or

evidence of the child's educational qualifications.

Additional information for CCS may include:

pay slip

letter from organisation where the individual volunteers.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 7 How to claim, section 154 General power to obtain information

Written notice to request information

A request for information must be by a written notice, which may be given:

personally

by post

electronically, or

in any other approved manner.

The written notice must specify the following:

how the person is to give the information, or produce the document or records to which the request relates

the period within which the person is required to provide the document or records

the contact officer, to whom the information is to be given (if applicable), and

that the notice is given under FA(Admin)Act section 158.

The date for providing information must not be less than 14 days after the notice is given (unless a shorter period is specified in the notice).

If the notice requires the person to give information by appearing before a specified officer, the notice must specify the time and place at which the person is to appear, which must be at least 14 days after the notice is given.

Explanation:

Providing a written notice to the individual enables Centrelink and the individual to retain and keep records. It also enables Centrelink to make allowances for individuals who reside in remote areas and those whose employment may take them away from their normal address for extended periods such as truck drivers, oil rig workers or carnival employees.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 154 General power to obtain information, section 158(3) Written notice of requirement

Obtaining information from third parties

An authorised officer may require third parties to give information to Centrelink about individuals receiving FA payments. This is to detect cases in which FA was paid to people who were not entitled to the payment and/or to verify the eligibility of people who have made claims for FA.

Explanation:

The Commonwealth has an obligation to prevent people who are not eligible or entitled for payment from receiving FA payments. To help with this process Centrelink may require information from other sources such as the

ATO

and other Australian and overseas government departments, banks and financial institutions in order to determine an individual's entitlement to a payment. Centrelink is limited in the type of information they may request to verify and validate claims.

4.1.4 Early claims for family assistance

Summary

This topic describes when an early claim for

FTB

may be made and the deferral of determination of early claims. A more detailed description of the claim process for this payment is provided at

4.2

.

Early claims for

FA

Claims for FTB by instalment may be made up to 97 days before the expected

DOB

of the child or the day the child is expected to enter the care of the individual making the claim. The day that the child is expected to be born or to enter the individual's care is the day the child is expected to become an FTB child of the individual. Early claims are subject to deferral rules.

Act reference:

Policy reference:

FTB child

Deferral of determination of early claim for FTB

An early claim cannot be determined before the child has been born or has come into care. Where an individual makes an early claim for payment of FTB by instalment and Centrelink is satisfied that the individual would be eligible for FTB in respect of the child, Centrelink will defer determination of the claim until the earlier of the following:

the day the child becomes an FTB child of the individual, or is stillborn, or

28 days after the day on which the child is expected to become an FTB child of the individual.

Example:

Sarah is expecting her first child on 2 January 2011 and lodges her claim for FA in October 2010. Sarah gives birth to her child on 4 January 2011 and provides proof of her child's birth to Centrelink on 16 January 2011. Centrelink can determine Sarah's claim, effective from 4 January 2011.

1.1.N.45 Notional assessment (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, a notional assessment is an assessment made by Child Support under the

CSA Act

of the payer's child support liability when there is a child support agreement in place. The notional assessment is used as a basis to assess FTB entitlement.

For child support agreements, Child Support will work out the annual rate of child support that would otherwise be payable under the child support legislation if there was no agreement. This will be called the 'Child Support notional assessment' because it is a 'notional' rather than an actual rate of child support. The amount of child support that would be received under a Child Support notional assessment is the amount that will be used in the maintenance income test (MIT) for FTB

Part A.

For child support collect cases, if less than 100% of the agreement amount of child support is collected, the MIT will not use 100% of the notional amount. Instead, a percentage of this amount that is equal to the percentage of the agreement amount received is used.

3.1.7.23 Maintenance income - modified entitlement method

Summary

The

MEM

was introduced on 1 July 2006 and affects the entitlement method (

1.1.E.35

) for estimating maintenance income when calculating

FTB

Part A. This topic covers:

overview of MEM

application of MEM, and

revision of estimate when child support assessment changes.

Overview of MEM

Under the MEM, an individual's FTB Part A rate is determined using the estimated maintenance income worked out by applying the higher of the entitlement method and the disbursement method formula.

A revision of the estimate will be made when child support entitlement increases part way through the year under the MEM. The MEM will apply the higher of the estimate under the disbursement method and the estimate under the entitlement method.

These changes complement the introduction of the

MIC

(

3.1.7.05

) to take better account of child support arrears when calculating FTB entitlement.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 20(3) Determination of rate may be based on estimate …

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.10

Maintenance income test - general provisions,

3.1.7.21

Maintenance income - entitlement method,

3.1.7.22

Maintenance income - disbursement method,

3.1.7.30

Application of the maintenance income test

Application of MEM

The MEM will apply:

only to individuals who have chosen the Child Support collection method, and

where the individual's FTB entitlement is assessed by choice or by default under the entitlement method and can include individuals that have had their FTB rate continuously adjusted.

The MEM will not apply:

during a period of private collection, or

during a period where the individual has chosen to be assessed under the disbursement method.

Each time Child Support notifies Centrelink of a disbursement that has been made to the eligible MEM individual, Centrelink will calculate the FTB Part A entitlement of the individual based on both the entitlement method and the disbursement method formula and compare the 2 results. The ongoing FTB Part A rate will be based on the higher estimate of maintenance income produced by the 2 results; that is the method that provides the lowest FTB Part A rate will be applied. If the estimate of maintenance income of the 2 results is equal, then the entitlement method will be used.

Individuals who have chosen MEM will be transferred to the disbursement method when the disbursement method calculation produces a lower FTB Part A entitlement than the entitlement method. Generally this will only occur where the Child Support collects an amount in excess of the usual monthly payment from the payer and transmits this to the payee (

1.1.P.71

). Often this will be an arrears payment of child support.

If an individual using the Child Support collection method is on the disbursement method under the MEM earlier in the income year, then has a reduction in child support payments that results in the entitlement method comparison producing a higher estimate of maintenance, the individual will revert back to the entitlement method.

If an individual in receipt of FTB is assessed using MEM and is on the disbursement method at 30 June, they will revert to the entitlement method from 1 July of the new income year until they satisfy the conditions to change to the disbursement method again in the new income year. This is because the entitlement method will always result in the same or higher estimate than the disbursement method at the start of the new income year.

Example:

Jennifer, has chosen the Child Support collection method and is entitled to child support of $3,000 in the 2006-07 financial year. Her ex-husband Eric, stopped making any payment from February 2005. Jennifer is currently being assessed on the entitlement method. In August 2006, Child Support collected and forwarded to Jennifer an amount of $4,750, being full outstanding arrears of $4,500 and the expected monthly amount of $250. Eric continued to make regular monthly payments of $250 for subsequent months, so Jennifer received a total of $7,250 child support in 2006-07.

The estimated maintenance for Jennifer in 2006-07 under the different methods is as follows:

Method

Dates

$3,000 (entitlement method is the higher estimate)

$7,250 (disbursement method is the higher estimate)

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.3.1.30

Mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB instalments

Revision of estimate when child support assessment changes

From July 2006, the entitlement method ceases to be based solely on the new liability amount. The estimate takes into account of the liability amounts over the full year, as occurs when the liability decreases. This change applies to both Child Support collection and to private collection.

Example:

If a child support liability for 2006-07 is $3,000 for the first 6 months then increases to $4,000 for the remainder of the year. Prior to July 2006, a maintenance estimate of $4,000 applied. While this reduced the risk of an overpayment, it overestimated the amount for that financial year, as the actual entitlement for the full year was $3,495.89. So from 1 July 2006, $3,495.89 is used for the annual maintenance estimate for the remainder of the year.

To avoid the risk of overpayment where the liability increases, the individual will have their rate continuously adjusted when they notify of an increase in their income estimate.

Definition

Before the Family Law Reform changes in 1996, a custodian was a person with whom a child lived all or most of the time and who had care of the child. Although this is usually a natural or adoptive parent, a custodian does not have to be a child's parent.

The appropriate term became 'resident parent' (

4.9.3 Outcomes of new financial year assessments

Summary

There are several possible outcomes arising from the new financial year and transitional period assessment process. These outcomes depend on whether or not the individual (

1.1.I.90

) responds to Centrelink after being contacted and, in cases where they do respond, the nature of their response.

This topic contains information on the following:

new financial year assessment (NFYA) options for individuals

where an individual does not respond

where an individual's revised estimate is assessed as reasonable

where an individual's new estimate is assessed as unreasonable, and

when the estimated income amount applies.

NFYA options for individuals

Individuals are contacted as part of the NFYA process or after being granted

FTB

after the NFYA process started, but before the new financial year. Individuals are given 2 options regarding the estimate of income to be used to determine their rate of FTB and/or

CCS

percentage from the beginning of the new financial year.

The 2 options individuals are given in relation to their estimate for the new financial year are:

provide a new estimate that will be used to determine their rate of FTB and/or CCS percentage from the beginning of the new financial year, or

accept the indexed amount that is provided in the letter to determine their rate of FTB and/or CCS percentage from the beginning of the new financial year.

Note:

Where individuals make a new CCS claim after the NFYA process and before the start of the new financial year, they will instead be required to provide their combined annual estimated

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for both the current and new financial year. Therefore, these individuals will not be provided with an indexed estimate.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 20(2A) Determination of rate may be based on estimate, indexed estimate or indexed actual income, section 20A Indexed estimates, section 20B Indexed actual incomes, section 20C Indexed estimates and indexed actual income of members of couples, section 67DB(2) Estimate, section 67DC Indexed estimates, section 67DD Indexed actual incomes, section 67DE Indexed estimates and indexed actual incomes for members of couples

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.5.1

CCS - combined annual ATI,

4.9.1

Overview of new financial year assessments

Where an individual does not respond

If an individual does not respond to the request to provide an estimate, the indexed estimate amount provided in the advice is used to determine their rate of FTB from the beginning of the new financial year, provided this is more than 14 days after the NFYA is given.

A CCS percentage determined using an indexed estimate will apply from the first Monday of a CCS fortnight that is after the start of the new financial year, and that is also at least 14 days after the NFYA is given.

Note:

If the letter is returned to sender, then normal returned mail procedures apply.

Example:

A family is being paid instalments of FTB and their CCS for the current financial year based on an estimate of their combined ATI of $32,500. When contacted, they choose not to respond. Centrelink uses the family's indexed amount (the most recent estimate multiplied by the indexation factor) in the advice to determine their rate of FTB and CCS percentage from the beginning of the new financial year (FTB) and the first Monday of a CCS fortnight after 1 July (CCS).

If an individual whose payments are based on an indexed estimate does not later provide their own revised estimate, they may also be subject to the second stage of income indexation. This second stage of income indexation is based on the individual's, and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) actual ATI from the

ATO

.

Centrelink will index the actual ATI from the ATO by the indexation factor. The indexed actual ATI will then be compared to the indexed estimate and the higher amount will be used to determine the individual's rate of payment.

Example:

A family is receiving CCS and FTB by instalments for the current financial year based on an indexed estimate of their combined ATI. When their previous year's income is confirmed by the ATO, Centrelink calculates their indexed actual income (the most recent confirmed income from the ATO multiplied by the indexation factor). If this is higher than the current indexed estimate, it will be used to determine the individual's rate of FTB and CCS percentage from the earliest date the new estimate can apply.

Indexed income - actual or estimate (FTB),

4.9.1

Overview of new financial year assessments

Where an individual's revised estimate is assessed as reasonable

Where an individual's rate of FTB or CCS percentage is based on an estimate, indexed estimate or indexed actual income, the individual may choose to provide a revised income estimate upon which their rate of FTB and CCS percentage may be calculated. In this instance, Centrelink will assess whether the individual's revised estimate is reasonable (

3.2.8.30

). If reasonable, Centrelink will use this new estimate to determine the individual's rate of FTB and/or CCS percentage from either the day the revised estimate was provided (or the first Monday of the next CCS fortnight after the revised estimate was provided for CCS) or the first day of the new financial year (or the first Monday of a CCS fortnight that is after the start of the new financial year), in accordance with FA(Admin)Act section 31A.

Example 1:

Wendy is receiving FTB by instalments based on an indexed income estimate of $45,000. Following an increase in her partner's overtime payments, Wendy provides Centrelink with a revised income estimate of $51,000. Centrelink assesses this new estimate to be reasonable based on the information provided by the individual. Wendy's payments will now be based on the revised income estimate of $51,000, beginning from the date the advice was received.

Example 2:

Richard and his wife Prue are receiving FTB by instalments and CCS for the current financial year and are advised (through the NFYA process) that their indexed income estimate is $29,000 for the new financial year. Richard advises Centrelink that they wish to have their new estimate of $45,000 used for the new financial year. Centrelink assesses this new estimate to be reasonable based on the information provided by Richard. From the beginning of the next financial year, the family's FTB instalments and CCS percentage are determined using their income estimate of $45,000.

Note:

When an individual whose payments are based on indexed estimates provides their own revised estimate, they will not be subject to the second stage of income indexation (of actual income).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 31A Variation of instalment entitlement determination to reflect revised adjusted taxable income estimates, section 20 Determination of rate may be based on estimate, indexed estimate or indexed actual income, section 20A Indexed estimates, section 20B Indexed actual incomes, section 67DB(2) Estimate, section 67DC Indexed estimates, section 67DD Indexed actual incomes

Where an individual's new estimate is assessed as unreasonable

An individual may choose to provide their own estimate for the new financial year, instead of accepting the indexed estimate provided by Centrelink. In this instance, Centrelink will assess whether the individual's estimate is reasonable. If it is determined to be unreasonable, Centrelink will contact the individual to discuss a new reasonable estimate. If the individual decides not to provide a new estimate, or provide evidence to show their previous estimate is reasonable, Centrelink will make a determination that the individual is not entitled to be paid FTB or CCS for the new financial year unless a new reasonable estimate is provided or the individual indicates they accept the indexed estimate.

Example 1:

Barry and his wife Michelle are paid FTB by instalments for the current financial year. They decide to provide a lower estimate than the indexed estimate provided by Centrelink for the next financial year because Michelle expects to work fewer hours in the next financial year. Barry contacts Centrelink and advises of their new estimate. Centrelink assesses this estimate as unreasonable based on information provided by Barry. Negotiations with Barry for a new estimate are unsuccessful. Centrelink determines that Barry is not entitled to be paid FTB by instalment or receive CCS payments during the next financial year as a reasonable estimate has not been provided. Barry is advised of this decision and that any amounts he may be entitled to may only be calculated at the end of the financial year, once he has met reconciliation conditions (confirmed his actual ATI for that year). If Barry provides a reasonable estimate before the beginning of the next financial year, he may start receiving CCS and FTB payments for the remainder of the financial year (any amounts he may be entitled to for the period he did not have a reasonable estimate in place can only be assessed and paid at end of year reconciliation).

Example 2:

George is being paid FTB by instalments and CCS for the current financial year. George advises Centrelink of a new estimate for the next financial year that is lower than the current estimate being used for his FTB and CCS payments. George explains that his partner expects a lower income in the next financial year as she will be working fewer hours. Centrelink assesses this estimate as unreasonable as the expected reduction in working hours does not justify the significant reduction of the estimate. George renegotiates a new reasonable estimate with Centrelink. Centrelink determines that George is entitled to be paid FTB by instalment for the new financial year and continue being paid CCS as a reasonable estimate has been agreed.

Note:

Individuals who have fluctuating income may find it difficult to provide an accurate reasonable estimate. These individuals may choose to provide an estimate at the upper end of an estimated income range, in order to avoid possible overpayments. Where applicable, Centrelink may advise the individual of the consequences of such an approach including possible loss of eligibility for the

HCC

or having a lower CCS percentage.

Revised estimates,

4.4.3

Estimate of income not reasonable

When does the income amount apply?

The income amount resulting from the NFYA process occurring in the current financial year applies from a date on or after 1 July of the new financial year.

In most cases, the application of the income amount will be from the beginning of the new financial year. However, the start date for the application of the income amount provided in the notice under FA(Admin)Act subsection 20A(2) or subsection 20B(2) for FTB is at least 14 days after the day on which the notice is given. This means that an individual may have the income amount applied on or after 1 July of the relevant income year.

For CCS, the start date for the application of the income amount provided in a notice under subsection 67DC(2) (indexed estimate notice) or subsection 67DD(2) (indexed actual notice) must be the first Monday of a CCS fortnight that is also at least 14 days after the notice was given.

Example:

Jane claims FTB on 25 June providing her ATI for the current year as $50,498. As Jane is unable to provide an estimate of her ATI for the new financial year beginning 1 July, she agrees with Centrelink to use indexed actual income based on her most recent ATI for the new financial year. A notice is issued under FA(Admin)Act subsection 20B(2) on 26 June. Jane's FTB payments can only be based on the indexed amount on or after 10 July of the new financial year. Before the new rates take effect, Jane's FTB payments will be based on her estimated ATI of $50,498.

4.2.4.50 Claim action 5 - already entitled to FTB instalments

Is a letter required?

No.

What to do

Centrelink must advise the applicant (

1.1.A.72

):

that the claim is not effective (

1.1.E.10

) because they are already entitled to receive

FTB

by fortnightly payments, and

they do not need to lodge another claim to trigger a reassessment of their instalment (

1.1.I.100

) entitlement.

Make whatever changes may be required to the existing assessment of their current entitlement.

Record-keeping

An electronic or paper file record of this advice should be kept.

4.13.2.10 CCS - CWA enrolment

Summary

CWA

enrolments are created by approved providers (

1.1.A.90

) when they enter into a CWA with an individual (

1.1.I.90

). An individual is only eligible to receive

CCS

for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) if their child is enrolled under a CWA with the provider of the service.

The following details must be provided accurately in an enrolment notice for the CWA enrolment (

1.1.E.25

) to be linked to the individual's eligibility and entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) information held by Centrelink:

parent (

1.1.P.10

)/guardian (CCS claimant)

CRN

*

child CRN*

CCS claimant's

DOB

child DOB

the parties to the arrangement (the provider and individual** liable to pay the fees)

enrolment start date (the date the arrangement was established)

whether care is expected to be provided on a routine or casual basis, or both

the days and times of any routine sessions of care (if applicable)

the usual fees to be charged for any routine sessions of care (or if there are none, a usual casual rate).

*A CWA enrolment notice can be submitted without a parent and/or child CRN if it is not available when the arrangement is created (to ensure providers can still meet the relevant timeframe for giving the notice). However, CCS cannot be paid until the provider updates the enrolment notice with the correct CRN/s and it is linked to the parent's CCS claim (

1.1.C.27

).

**A CCS claimant can be eligible for CCS if either they, or their partner (

1.1.P.30

), has incurred a liability to pay for sessions of care under a CWA. This means the individual who enters into the CWA with the provider can be either the CCS claimant themselves, or their partner. When submitting the enrolment notice for the child in the CCSS, the approved provider must submit the details of the parent who is the CCS claimant, even where they are not the parent on the CWA, to ensure subsidy can be paid.

The enrolment details must reflect the actual terms that the provider and individual have agreed to in their arrangement. The CCS claimant will need to confirm these details are correct (typically through their Centrelink online account) before CCS can be paid to the provider on their behalf.

4.4.3 Estimate of income not reasonable

Summary

A reasonable estimate of taxable income can be provided where:

a variation to an income amount is requested

a claim is made for

FTB

by instalment, or

a claim is made for a past period, and

the taxable income (

1.1.T.20

) for the financial year is not known.

Income estimates are used to calculate the individual's FTB entitlement. The estimate is reconciled against the individual's (and their partner's, if they have one) actual income for the relevant income year when it becomes available. Adjustments may be made to the individual's FTB entitlements during reconciliation after which any top-ups may be paid or overpayments raised.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.2.8

Reasonable estimate of income

Consideration of estimate

Where an individual provides an estimate of their income, Centrelink will determine if the estimate is reasonable.

If the estimate is not considered reasonable, Centrelink will request the individual to provide evidence in support of their estimate. If evidence is not provided or does not substantiate the estimate, Centrelink will determine that the individual is not entitled to receive FTB. This means current payments being made by instalments will be cancelled. In the case of new or past period claims, entitlement will be assessed at reconciliation.

Where an individual is being paid by instalments, the date of effect of the FTB cancellation is the day after the end of the individual's latest entitlement period. This could be the day after their next payday or the day after the final payday in the current financial year, depending on when the estimate applies.

Example:

A family is claiming FTB by instalments for the current financial year and provide a new estimate which is lower than the estimate upon which current entitlements are based. Centrelink assesses this estimate as unreasonable based on information provided by the employer and enters into negotiations for a new estimate with the Individual. Negotiations are unsuccessful. Centrelink determines that the individual is not entitled to be paid FTB by instalment and ceases paying FTB. Payment is cancelled the day after their next payday. The individual is advised of the decision to cancel their FTB instalments and advised that their FTB will be assessed at reconciliation unless a new reasonable estimate is provided in the future.

Note:

In the above example, if the estimate was for the new financial year, then the individual's payment would be cancelled on the day after their last payday for the current financial year, unless a new estimate is provided and assessed as reasonable.

Outcomes of new financial year assessments

Subsequent estimate considered reasonable

If the individual subsequently provides an estimate of

ATI

by the end of the income year following the one in which the variation took effect, which is considered reasonable, or Centrelink becomes aware of the individual's actual assessed ATI details, the cancellation of entitlement should be overturned. The date of effect of this variation is the date of cancellation. The variation reinstates the determination that applied before the cancellation.

3.5.2.30 ACCS (transition to work) - recognised participation & subsidised hours result

Summary

This topic explains how

CCS

recognised participation applies to

ACCS

(transition to work).

Recognised participation for ACCS (transition to work)

The number of hours of care available to an individual (

1.1.I.90

) under ACCS (transition to work) are the same number of hours the individual is eligible for under CCS, including any CCS Minister’s Rules or exceptional circumstances results. The number of eligible hours is determined by the hours of recognised participation an individual completes in a fortnight.

If the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50)

, the lowest of the 2 recognised participation hours translates to the subsidised hours the individual is eligible for. All eligible individuals will be entitled to a basic subsidy amount of 72 hours per fortnight, and depending on their circumstances, may be eligible for an increased hours result of 100 hours per fortnight.

ACCS (transition to work) is only payable for the hours of care determined by the individual’s subsidised hours result (that is, the basic subsidy amount or the increased hours result, depending on their recognised participation). If an individual's child attends more sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) than the hours they are eligible for they will not receive assistance under CCS or ACCS for the additional hours.

Example:

An individual may have a subsidised hours result of the basic subsidy amount of 72 hours per fortnight but elect to use 80 hours of care (8 × 10 hours sessions). They will receive the subsidy for 72 hours but will need to pay the full fees for the additional 8 hours they use (80 − 72 = 8 hours).

3.1.1.30 Shared care rate for FTB

Summary

The following table shows possible shared care situations for

FTB

and where you will find more information.

Situation

Detail

Two or more individuals (

1.1.I.90

) share the care of an FTB child, and the individuals are not members of the same couple (

1.1.M.50

) during the period of the claim.

This topic

An individual shares the care of a child with another individual, other than the partner, for 14% to less than 35% of the time and has no other FTB children.

RA

may be payable under Method 3

3.1.4.30

Two individuals who have separated both claim FTB for a past period when they were members of the same couple.

3.1.1.34

Sharing FTB for separated couples

This topic provides information about sharing FTB between individuals who are not members of the same couple and who share the care of an FTB child. It covers the following:

determination to share FTB

shared rate of

MBA

RA,

NBS

and

NBU

are not shared, and

calculating the FTB Part A and Part B rate in shared care cases.

From 20 March 2017, the

ES

ceased for new FTB recipients. For individuals who became new recipients of FTB after 20 September 2016, they will no longer be paid ES after 19 March 2017. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is not payable when the combined

ATI

is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year.

Determination to share FTB

A determination must be made under FAAct section 59 to share FTB if more than one individual cares for a child. The determination must specify a shared care percentage for each individual, based on the pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

) for the care period (

1.1.C.100

). A determination of shared care has an effect on the following FTB rate components:

standard rate of FTB Part A

ES Part A

FTB Part A supplement

standard rate of FTB Part B

ES Part B

FTB Part B supplement, and

multiple birth allowance.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 59 Shared care percentages where individual is FTB child of more than one person who are not members of the same couple, Schedule 1 clause 11 Sharing FTB (shared care percentages), Schedule 1 clause 38E Rate of RA payable to individual who is a relevant shared carer or who has only one or more regular care children

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.1.10

Calculating a rate of FTB - overview,

2.1.1.25

Shared care of an FTB child

FTB must be paid according to determination

Once a determination has been made to share FTB, it can only be paid in the specified proportion, even if FTB is not payable to one of the individuals.

Example:

Brian and Natasha have a son Sam, aged 10. Brian and Natasha are separated and each care for Sam 50% of the time. They both receive FTB at 50% of the standard rate for one child under 13. Brian has been promoted and expects his income to be $130,000 per year. Brian no longer satisfies the income test for FTB. Natasha is still only eligible for 50% of the standard rate for a child under 13, and is subject to her own ATI reduction as her family income is $55,000.

Shared rate of MBA

If the care of one or more MBA child/ren is shared, the rate of MBA for each child is shared according to the FTB shared care determination. The following table shows how to calculate a shared rate of MBA.

Step

Action

1

Work out the amount of MBA payable per child by dividing the MBA rate payable by the number of MBA children.

2

Work out the shared proportion of MBA for each child by multiplying the MBA rate payable for the child by the individual's FTB shared care percentage for that child.

3

Add the shared proportion of MBA for each child to give the total amount of MBA payable to each individual.

Example:

Kelly and Michael have 4 year old triplets. After they separated, they had an FTB shared care determination for each of the triplets. The FTB shared care percentages for Kelly and Michael respectively attributed to each of the children are: Susan 35%/65%, Harry 50%/50% and Richard 60%/40%.

Using 2017-18 payment rates, Kelly's share of MBA is worked out as follows:

Susan: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 35% = $471.82

Harry: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 50% = $674.03

Richard: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 60% = $808.84

Total MBA rate for Kelly = $1,954.69

Michael's share of MBA is worked out as follows:

Susan: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 65% = $876.24

Harry: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 50% = $674.03

Richard: $4,044.20 ÷ 3 × 40% = $539.23

Total MBA rate for Michael = $2,089.50

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 38 Sharing MBA (determinations under section 59A)

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.1.31

Shared care rate calculation

RA, NBS & NBU are not shared

RA, NBS and NBU are not shared. RA, NBS and NBU are paid at the relevant rate to each eligible individual. This means that each eligible individual receives the full amount of RA, NBS and NBU subject to any reduction due to income or maintenance income applicable to each eligible individual.

Explanation:

The shared care percentage is only applied to the standard rate of FTB, ES, FTB supplements and MBA. RA, NBS and NBU are not included in the standard rate.

Example:

Kathy and Rex have 5 children. They have separated and share the care of all of their children. Both Rex and Kathy receive instalments of FTB. Rex pays private rent for his accommodation, and is entitled to receive RA. Rex's FTB rate includes a shared care proportion of FTB Part A and Part B, ES Part A and Part B and the relevant rate of RA taking into account 5 FTB children. Kathy receives a shared care proportion of FTB Part A and Part B, ES Part A and Part B.

Calculating shared care rate of FTB Part A

The following table shows how to calculate the FTB Part A rate payable to each individual when the care of the FTB child is shared.

Step

Action

1

Determine the FTB child rate (

1.1.F.57

) payable for each FTB child of the individual under Method 1 (

3.1.4

) and Method 2 (

3.1.8

).

2

Determine the percentage of care for each FTB child for each individual.

3

Work out the FTB shared care percentage (

3.1.1.31

).

4

Multiply the FTB child rate for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for that child. The result is the shared care rate for the child payable to the individual.

5

Add the shared care rates payable for all FTB children of the individual. The result is the individual's standard rate of FTB Part A.

6

Determine the ES child rate (

3.1.1.25

) payable for each FTB child of the individual under Method 1 and Method 2.

7

Multiply the ES child rate for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for that child determined in Step 3. The result is the shared care rate for the child payable to the individual.

8

Add the shared care rates payable for all FTB children for the individual. The result is the individual's standard rate of ES Part A.

9

Work out the individual's rate of FTB Part A supplement (percentage applicable).

10

Work out the individual's rate of MBA (percentage applicable). Refer to this topic to calculate the rate of MBA.

11

Work out the individual's rate of NBS and RA if applicable. NBS is paid at the full rate to each eligible parent and RA may be paid at the relevant rate for each eligible individual.

Note 1:

RA is only payable under a Method 1 calculation.

Note 2:

If an individual is eligible for NBS, the full rate of NBU is also paid in respect of the first day of NBS eligibility.

12

Add the standard rate of FTB Part A, ES Part A, FTB Part A supplement, MBA, NBS and RA. This is the maximum rate.

13

Apply the income test for Part A using Method 1 and then Method 2.

14

Apply the maintenance income test to the Method 1 income tested rate.

15

Compare the maintenance and income tested Method 1 rate to the income tested rate worked out under Method 2. The Part A rate payable is the higher of the 2 rates. The result is the individual's rate of FTB Part A.

Method 2

Calculating shared care rate of FTB Part B

The following tables show how to calculate the FTB Part B rate payable to each individual when the care of an FTB child is shared.

Step

Action

Individual has one FTB child, and care is shared

1

Work out the FTB Part B standard rate payable according to the age of the youngest child.

2

Work out the percentage of care for that child.

3

Work out the FTB shared care percentage for the child (

3.1.1.31

).

4

Multiply the standard rate by the FTB shared care percentage for the child.

5

Work out the ES Part B rate payable according to age of the youngest child.

6

Work out the percentage of care for that child.

7

Work out the FTB shared care percentage for the child.

8

Multiply the ES Part B rate by the FTB shared care percentage for the child.

9

Work out the rate of FTB Part B supplement by multiplying the gross supplement amount by the FTB shared care percentage for the child.

10

Work out the FTB Part B maximum rate by adding the results of Steps 4, 8 and 9.

11

If the individual is single, the result from Step 10 is the individual's rate of FTB Part B.

If the individual is partnered, go to Step 12.

12

Apply the income test for Part B to the result from Step 10. The result is the individual's rate of FTB Part B.

Step

Action

Individual has more than one FTB child, and care is not shared for all children

1

Work out the FTB Part B standard rate payable for each of the FTB children that would otherwise be eligible for FTB Part B of the individual whose care is not shared, as if they were an only child.

2

Work out the percentage of care for each of the shared care children.

3

Work out the FTB shared care percentage for each of the shared care children (

3.1.1.31

).

4

Work out the standard rate for each shared care FTB child as if they were an only child.

5

Multiply the result from Step 4 for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for that child.

6

Compare the results from Step 1 and Step 5. The highest rate payable for any of the FTB children is the individual's standard rate of FTB Part B.

7

Work out the ES Part B standard rate payable for each of the FTB children of the individual whose care is not shared, as if they were an only child.

8

Work out the percentage of care for each of the shared care children.

9

Work out the FTB shared care percentage for each of the shared care children.

10

Work out the ES Part B standard rate for each shared care FTB child as if they were an only child.

11

Multiply the result from Step 10 for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for that child.

12

Compare the results from Step 7 and Step 11. The highest rate payable for any of the FTB children is the individual's standard rate of ES Part B.

13

If the individual has 100% of at least one FTB child, the rate of FTB Part B supplement is the FTB Part B gross supplement amount.

If the individual has only shared care of FTB children, their FTB Part B supplement amount is the highest rate resulting from multiplying the FTB shared care percentage for each child by the FTB Part B gross supplement amount.

14

Work out the individual's FTB Part B maximum rate by adding the FTB Part B supplement amount from Step 13 to the individual's standard rate from Step 6 and the ES Part B amount from Step 12.

15

If the individual is single, the result from Step 14 is the individual's rate of FTB Part B. If the individual is partnered, go to Step 16.

16

Apply the income test for Part B to the result from Step 14. The result is the individual's rate of FTB Part B.

6.4.1.20 Payments affected by reconciliation

Summary

This topic describes the

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) payments and amounts included in reconciliation.

Payments affected by reconciliation

FTB

and

CCS

are reconciled.

ACCS

payments are not reconciled.

The reconciliation of FTB covers all components that make up the payment comprising:

FTB Part A standard rate

ES

Part A

rent assistance

NBS

and

NBU

multiple birth allowance

FTB Part B standard rate

ES Part B

FTB Part A and Part B supplements (included at time of reconciliation, subject to certain conditions being satisfied - see

6.4.1.30

for further details), and

SIFS

(included at time of reconciliation, subject to certain conditions being satisfied - see

2.11

and

6.7

for further details).

Note:

The ES ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

The following payments are not reconciled:

FTB advances (see below)

SBP

(paid under the income test)

low income

HCC

FTB payments to ACOs (

1.1.A.80

)

double orphan pension, and

additional child care subsidy.

Amounts reconciled

FTB or CCS paid in respect of an individual's entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) are included in reconciliation.

This includes:

payments made in respect of a period in the relevant income year but not received in that year, and

bereavement payments of FTB made for a period during the relevant income year.

This excludes:

arrears payments received in the relevant income year in respect of a period in a previous income year

reissued returned payments, and

amounts paid in respect of periods in the relevant income year already raised as debts.

FTB advances

The reduction of an individual's FTB Part A rate due to receipt of an FTB advance is part of the rate calculation process for FTB. Reconciliation compares the individual's FTB entitlement based on an estimate with their rate based on

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

). The FTB Part A amounts that are compared in this process are the amounts as reduced by the FTB advance repayment, but the advance payment itself is not taken into account in this process.

The initial receipt of an advance will not be affected by variations to FTB Part A entitlement applicable to the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

) in the reconciliation process if the variation is caused by the individual's actual ATI or maintenance income only. However, variations to FTB entitlement applicable to the advance assessment day as a result of changes in other circumstances may affect the individual's entitlement to an advance amount issued, whether these changes are identified as a result of the reconciliation process or otherwise.

FTB advance debts

NBS & NBU

The NBS component of FTB Part A is also included in the FTB reconciliation process. Where reconciliation results in nil FTB entitlement for part or all of a period that NBS was paid, the NBS for that period is raised as a debt. The NBU is raised as a debt where FTB reconciliation results in nil FTB Part A entitlement for the day that NBU was paid. However, as an individual can be eligible for NBS/NBU for any day within a period of 52 weeks beginning on the child's birth or entrustment to care as part of an adoption process, NBS and/or NBU eligibility may exist for a later date. In these cases, the reconciliation debt raised may be offset with the NBS/NBU entitlement for the later period.

Example:

Hunter has a child entrusted to their care as part of an adoption process on 1 February. Hunter claims FTB Part A and receives NBU and NBS for 91 days beginning on the day of entrustment to care. FTB reconciliation completes for the relevant year on 1 December and results in Hunter having nil FTB entitlement for the period that NBS was paid. However, as Hunter was still receiving FTB on 1 July of the subsequent year, Hunter is now eligible for NBU and NBS from 1 July. The NBU and NBS reconciliation debt is offset by the NBU and NBS entitlement for the period 1 July to 29 September of the subsequent year, and as the NBS rate had increased on 1 July due to indexation, the difference in rates is used to offset part of Hunter's FTB Part A reconciliation debt.

SBP

Individuals who receive SBP may be indirectly subject to reconciliation. Where SBP is paid under the income test, payment is not reconciled. Where SBP is paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test, the SBP is not reconciled directly, but is raised as a debt where FTB reconciliation results in nil FTB Part A entitlement for the day that SBP was paid.

Note:

If SBP is raised as a debt due to FTB Part A reconciliation, the individual may still be eligible for SBP for a later date. In this case, a debt is raised for the original payment and the debt is offset by the new SBP entitlement for the later date.

Example:

Jane is receiving FTB Part A by instalments for 2 children and gives birth to a stillborn child. Jane does not meet the SBP income test, but is eligible for payment as they are in receipt of FTB Part A. SBP is paid due to Jane's FTB Part A eligibility on the day of the stillbirth. At FTB reconciliation, Jane's ATI is above the FTB Part A threshold. As such, all of Jane's FTB Part A and SBP for the relevant year are raised as a debt during reconciliation. However, as Jane is still eligible for FTB Part A by instalments as at 1 July of the following year and it is still within 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillbirth, Jane is now paid SBP due to their FTB Part A eligibility on 1 July. The new SBP is used to offset the debt raised for the original payment, and as the SBP rate had increased on 1 July due to the indexation of NBS, NBU and FTB Part A under 13 rates, the difference in rates is used to offset part of Jane's FTB Part A debt.

1.1.C.40 Cohabitation, living together (FTB)

Usage

For the purposes of

FTB

, these terms are used only in relation to presumption of parentage (

1.1.P.110

) for child support (

1.1.C.20

).

Definition: cohabitation

The term 'cohabitation' refers to living together in a de facto relationship rather than just sharing accommodation.

When a separated couple recommence living together, they are considered to be 'cohabiting' in situations where the couple intended to resume their relationship, even if this intention only lasted a brief time.

Definition: living together

The term 'living together' rather than 'cohabitation' is used in the application for a child support assessment, as this is a more commonly used expression.

Decision about living together

For the purposes of establishing presumption of parentage, it is the responsibility of the individual (

1.1.I.90

) rather than Centrelink to decide if they and the other named parent of the child were living together. Centrelink does not need to make a decision about whether the individual was in a de facto relationship.

3.1.7.22 Maintenance income - disbursement method

Summary

This topic outlines how the disbursement method (

1.1.D.100

) is utilised in the estimation of maintenance income for the purposes of

FTB

. It covers:

overview of the disbursement method

application of the disbursement method, and

effects of reconciliation.

Overview

For the purposes of FTB, the disbursement method is an alternative way of estimating the amount of child support (

1.1.C.20

) an instalment (

1.1.I.100

) individual will receive during the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

). It can only be used for agency collect child support cases.

The disbursement method may be appropriate where the individual does not know how much child support they are likely to receive, or if the amount paid by the payer (

1.1.P.72

) is substantially less than their maintenance liability (

1.1.M.23

).

The individual must ask Services Australia to use the disbursement method to assess the amount of maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) they receive, otherwise the entitlement method (

1.1.E.35

) is used by default.

FA Guide

Relevant period,

3.1.7.21

Maintenance income - entitlement method

Application of the disbursement method

The individual's rate of FTB Part A is recalculated each time the monthly amount of child support they receive changes. This means that their FTB rate can change every month.

The estimate of child support is worked out by adding the amount of child support the individual has already received during the financial year to the amount projected for the rest of the relevant period. This second amount is worked out by multiplying the latest monthly child support payment the individual has received (less any arrears) by the number of months left in the financial year.

The amount of estimated child support for the financial year is then annualised when applying the

MIT

for the relevant period.

Example:

Maria separates from George on 30 August. Maria takes maintenance action by asking Services Australia to make an assessment of George's child support liability. The assessment comes into force on 1 October. Maria opts for private collection (

1.1.P.130

), but George fails to make any regular maintenance payments. Maria then requests that Services Australia collect the maintenance for her and they commence agency collection on 1 December. Maria also asks that Services Australia collect the amounts owing for October and November.

On the third Wednesday in January, Maria receives:

arrears of maintenance of $600 for October and November, and

a regular payment of maintenance of $300 for December.

An estimate of Maria's annual rate of maintenance income is calculated as follows:

Relevant period = 1 October to 30 June = 273 days

[(Year to date figure) + (latest regular payment × 5 months remaining in the relevant period)] × annualisation factor = ($900 + $1,500) × (365 ÷ 273) = $3,208.79

Reconciliation

For agency collect cases, the estimated amount of maintenance used to assess an individual's entitlement to FTB Part A is reconciled against the actual amount of maintenance received after the end of the financial year. This may result in a recalculation of their FTB Part A rate for that year.

2.1.1.13 Regular care child

Summary

A regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) of an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is a child who:

is in the individual's care for at least 14%, but less than 35%, of a care period, and

would be an

FTB

child of the individual but for the child being in the individual's care for less than 35% of the care period.

Act reference:

section 3(1)-'regular care child', section 25A Regular care child for each day in care period

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.10

FTB child

Payments or concessions for a regular care child

An individual who has care of a child for less than 35% of the time will not be eligible for the child components of FTB.

Instead of receiving the child components of FTB, an individual who has care of a child between 14% to less than 35% of the time will have the costs of the child taken into account in working out how much child support they will pay (where relevant). This level of care is called regular care and will be counted as meeting 24% of the costs of raising the child for child support purposes.

Individuals with regular care of a child will be eligible for the

RA

component of FTB Part A, and the following government benefits, if they meet eligibility requirements:

CCS

- if child care fees are paid to an approved provider, the individual, or the individual's partner (

1.1.P.30

) may be eligible to receive CCS

a

HCC

(if income does not exceed the FTB Part A lower income free area)

the lower threshold for the Medicare safety net in certain circumstances

additional

RAA

paid with social security income support payments (for example,

JSP

).

A parent who has shared care of a child for 35% to 65% of the time can be eligible for a share of the child components of FTB. This includes instalment or lump sum FTB payments and supplements. If an individual has more than 65% care of an eligible FTB child, they will receive 100% of the FTB payment.

6.4.1.10 Individuals affected by reconciliation

Summary

This topic identifies

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) individuals (

1.1.I.90

) who are affected by reconciliation.

FA individuals who receive FA on the basis of

ATI

and/or maintenance income may be subject to reconciliation. All individuals who receive

CCS

during the financial year will be subject to reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

).

ACCS

entitlement is not reconciled, but if an individual receives both ACCS and CCS during a financial year, the CCS amounts are always reconciled. ATI, maintenance income and/or child care usage may be relevant for

FTB

by instalment, CCS by fee reduction, or FTB for a past period.

FTB individuals to whom reconciliation does not apply

Certain FTB individuals are not subject to reconciliation of ATI - either because all the relevant actual ATI is known when their FTB claim is determined or because their FTB entitlement is not subject to the income test. These include:

single individuals in receipt of income support for the entire period during the relevant income year that they received payment (noting that individuals whose annual income is over $80,000 are not entitled the FTB Part A supplement regardless of whether they are in receipt of income support)

Explanation:

An individual's entitlement to FTB Part A is not subject to an income test during the period that they and/or their partner receive income support. For periods during which the individual and/or their partner does not receive income support, the FTB Part A income test is applicable. Single individuals are also eligible for the maximum rate of FTB Part B if their ATI is equal to or below the FTB Part B primary income earner limit.

single individuals claiming for a past period in the previous income year

Explanation:

A past period claim for a previous income year can be determined only when the individual's actual ATI for that year is known.

partnered individuals claiming for a past period in the previous income year where their partner's actual ATI is available at the time the claim is made.

Explanation:

If a partner's ATI is not available, a past period (lump sum) claim may only be determined using the individual and their partner's actual income once it is known.

Example:

Mary lodges an FTB claim on 1 August 2023 for the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 following lodgement of their tax return. Their partner Bill lodged their tax return in July 2023. Mary is paid FTB on the basis of their and their partner's combined actual 2022-23 ATI.

2.8.4.20 ACCS (transition to work) - income support payments & income requirements

Summary

This topic describes the eligibility requirements relating to income support payments (

1.1.I.50

) and income (

1.1.I.20

) requirements for

ACCS

(transition to work). This topic covers:

eligible income support payments

suspended income support payments

cancelled income support payments

income requirements.

Eligible income support payments

To be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must be in receipt of an eligible income support payment. The eligible income support payments are:

parenting payment

jobseeker payment

disability support pension

youth allowance

carer payment

SpB

austudy payment

a means tested payment under

ABSTUDY

farm household allowance.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CK Eligibility for ACCS (transition to work)

Suspended income support payments

If an individual's income support payment is suspended, they may continue to receive ACCS (transition to work) if the reason for suspension does not make them ineligible for ACCS (transition to work). In particular, an individual must still be participating in their ACCS (transition to work) activity during their income support suspension period and, if they are required to have a one, their Job Plan (

1.1.J.20

) must remain active. If an individual's income support payment is suspended due to inactivity relating to their ACCS (transition to work) activity, their ACCS (transition to work) will be cancelled.

Example:

Sam's income support payment is suspended due to a non-attendance failure. He makes another appointment with his employment services provider. He attends the appointment, and his income support payment is reinstated and backdated to the date of suspension. In these circumstances, if Sam is continuing to participate in his ACCS (transition to work) activity Sam would continue to receive ACCS (transition to work) during his suspension period.

Cancelled income support payments

If an individual's income support payment is cancelled, then their ACCS (transition to work) payments will also be cancelled. When an individual's income support payment is cancelled during a

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

), to take effect immediately, they will no longer be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) from the first Monday of the next CCS fortnight. If an income support payment is cancelled retrospectively to take effect from a previous CCS fortnight where payments have already been made, it may mean that an individual was paid ACCS (transition to work) when they were not eligible for it, and may incur a debt.

Income requirements

To meet the income requirements an individual's income estimate has to be lower than the CCS lower income threshold (

1.1.I.70

).

ACCS (transition to work) is not subject to the end of year reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

), and therefore, actual income determined at reconciliation does not affect past ACCS (transition to work) eligibility. If an individual's income is above the low income threshold at reconciliation ACCS (transition to work) eligibility will not be re-assessed retrospectively. If the income estimate for the subsequent year is above the lower income threshold, this would be dealt with as a change of circumstances for ACCS (transition to work), and the individual would be ineligible for ACCS (transition to work) in future.

If the estimate for the subsequent year is below the actual income from the previous year, Centrelink can request additional information to support the lower income estimate.

Also, if during the end of year reconciliation process Centrelink has reason to suspect the estimate was not a reasonable estimate, or the individual should have notified of a change of circumstance during the year, a review may be undertaken. A review may be undertaken at any time and Centrelink may ask for additional information at any time.

8.1.2 Immunisation requirement changes from 01/01/2012 to 30/06/2018

Immunisation requirements from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015

From 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015 payment of the

FTB

Part A supplement to an individual was conditional on the FTB child who had turned one, 2 or 5 years during the relevant income year meeting immunisation requirements.

An FTB child met the immunisation requirements for the relevant income year if:

the child was up-to-date and not overdue with vaccinations as per the standard vaccination schedule

the child was on an approved catch-up vaccination schedule

there was a conscientious objection covering all vaccines

the child had a medical contraindication

the child had natural immunity, or

the child was in a class of person

exempted by the Minister from the requirement to be immunised, or

which the Minister had determined met the immunisation requirements.

The classes of children the Minister had exempted from the requirement to be immunised, or determined met the requirement in a disallowable instrument were:

participants in the vaccine study conducted by Murdoch Children's Research Institute

children who were unable to be immunised due to temporary unavailability of vaccine

children who were immunised overseas

children of practicing members of the Church of Christ - Scientist (religious exemption), and

children who the Secretary exempted from the requirement to be immunised due to special circumstances.

Immunisation requirements from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018

From 1 January 2016, the No Jab No Pay measure amended immunisation requirements for the FTB Part A end-of-year supplement. Immunisation requirements were extended to children who turned one in the relevant income year, and in each income year after that up to the end of the calendar year in which a child turns 19. The changes also removed vaccination objection based on personal, religious or philosophical beliefs (previously known as conscientious objection) as an approved exemption from meeting immunisation requirements.

Note:

From 1 July 2018, new immunisation requirements apply. Where immunisation requirements are not met, rather than withholding the FTB Part A end of year supplement, an individual's FTB Part A child rate may be reduced (

2.1.3.10

,

8.1.1

).

Part year effects for 2015-16 year

Two different sets of immunisation requirements were applied during the 2015-16 income year.

For the period 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015, immunisation requirements only apply to children who turn one, 2 or 5 during the income year. From 1 January 2016 onwards, immunisation requirements were extended to included children who turned one in the relevant income year and in each income year after that until the age of 19 (up to the end of the calendar year in which they turn 19).

Individuals with care of a child, who were exempt or considered to have met the immunisation requirements prior to 1 January 2016 (for example, conscientious objection), are entitled to the FTB Part A supplement during this period up to 31 December 2015, even if they are no longer considered to have met the immunisation requirements from 1 January 2016.

Example:

Ally has an objection to vaccinations and made a 'conscientious objection' declaration for her daughter Rosie, who turned one during the 2014-15 income year. As Rosie turned 2 in the 2015-16 income year, Rosie met the immunisation requirements, as a vaccination objector, from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015. Therefore Ally is entitled to at least half of the FTB Part A supplement for Rosie. At reconciliation for the 2015-16 income year Rosie is not up-to-date with her vaccinations, thus does not meet the immunisation requirements from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2016. Ally will receive part of the FTB Part A supplement for Rosie, in respect of meeting requirements from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015 (as long as all other reconciliation conditions are met).

Effect on past period lump sum claims

For lump sum past period claims, in most cases, the immunisation requirements that were in place at that time (the past period) will apply.

If an individual submits a lump sum past period claim for the 2014-15 income year or 2013-14 income year (where a special circumstances extension to meet immunisation requirements has been granted) and any of the FTB children in their care turned one, 2 or 5 years during that year, then they are still required to meet the immunisation requirements which applied from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015.

Individuals with care of a child, who were exempt or considered to have met the immunisation requirements prior to 1 January 2016 (for example, religious exemption) are entitled to the FTB Part A supplement during this period up to 31 December 2015, even if they are no longer considered to have met the immunisation requirements from 1 January 2016.

Example:

Emma has 2 children, twins Andrew and Adam who turned 5 in the 2014-15 income year. Emma is a member of the Church of Christ - Scientist and in the income year in which Andrew and Adam turned one, Emma provided Centrelink with a written declaration from a church official stating that she is a practicing member of the church, and a letter acknowledging the risks and benefits of immunisation and declaring that her children are not to be immunised because of religious convictions. This evidence was used to grant Emma an exemption for her children from meeting the immunisation requirements. As Emma already has an exemption in place, she meets immunisation requirements for the 2014-15 income year and will receive the FTB Part A supplement in respect of both Andrew and Adam (as long as all other reconciliation conditions are met).

Act reference:

FAAct pre-1 January 2016

section 61B(3) to section 61B(3A) Exception—immunisation requirements

Removed exemptions from 1 January 2016

A child cannot meet, or be exempt from, the immunisation requirements for a period from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015 (for example, 2014-15 lump sum claims) on the basis of a relevant conscientious objection certification or Church of Christ - Scientist declaration made on or after 1 January 2016. If evidence is signed and dated on or after 1 January 2016, it is not a valid declaration/certification.

Example:

Harry has never been eligible for FTB due to income, although due to illness his income was considerably lower during the 2014-15 income year so he decides to submit a past period lump sum claim. Harry has 2 children, the children turned 5 and 2 during the 2014-15 income year. Harry has an objection to vaccinations. Harry makes a declaration with his general practitioner in February 2016. Harry accompanies his lump sum claim form with his conscientious objection declaration and lodges it to Centrelink on 3 March 2016. Centrelink cannot accept the conscientious objection declaration form as it was completed and submitted after 1 January 2016, therefore Harry is not entitled to FTB Part A supplements for either of his children during the 2014-15 income year as he does not meet immunisation requirements.

Note:

If the evidence required for the removed exemption (for example, conscientious objection declaration) is signed and dated prior to 1 January 2016 and submitted to Centrelink or Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) after 31 December 2015 (but within the allowable timeframe for the relevant year) it can be accepted and applied.

Act reference:

Social Services Legislation Amendment (No Jab, No Pay) Act 2015

item 19(3) Application and transitional provisions

Certification of medical contraindication & natural immunity

Only eligible doctors can certify that immunisation of a child would be medically contraindicated or that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity.

From 17 August 2017, the following recognised immunisation providers (

1.1.R.09

) are eligible to certify medical contraindication and natural immunity:

a general practitioner (

1.1.G.12

)

a general practice registrar on a 3GA training placement

a paediatrician

a public health physician

an infectious diseases physician, or

a clinical immunologist.

From 1 January 2016 to 16 August 2018 only general practitioners could certify medical contraindication or natural immunity. Prior to 1 January 2016, medical contraindication and natural immunity were certified by recognised immunisation providers. If a child had a medical contraindication or natural immunity certified by a recognised immunisation provider prior to 1 January 2016, this will remain in place and will not need to be re-certified.

8.1.1 Immunisation requirement changes from 01/07/2018

Summary

From 1 July 2018, the No Jab, No Pay measure was strengthened with new compliance arrangements to provide a more immediate incentive for individuals to immunise their children. Where immunisation requirements are not met for children aged under 20 years, rather than withholding the

FTB

Part A end of year supplement, an individual's FTB Part A child rate will be reduced (

2.1.3.10

).

Note:

From 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015, immunisation requirements were assessed in the income years in which the FTB child turned one, 2 and 5 years. From 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, immunisation requirements applied to children for income years during which they turned one, and in each income year after that up to the end of the calendar year in which they turned 19 (including past period or lump sum claims). Where immunisation requirements are not met an individual's FTB Part A end of year supplement is withheld, rather than an individual's FTB Part A child rate being reduced (

8.1.2

).

Certification of medical contraindication & natural immunity

From 17 August 2017, eligibility to certify that immunisation of a child is medically contraindicated or that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity was extended from general practitioners (

1.1.G.12

), to also include paediatricians, public health physicians, infectious diseases physicians and clinical immunologists. From 1 January 2016 to 16 August 2017, only general practitioners could certify medical contraindication and natural immunity.

6.1 Centrelink review & appeal process

Summary

This chapter explains the Centrelink review and appeal process, and covers:

steps in the Centrelink review and appeal process

review of

FA

decisions

decisions made using computer programs

review and appeal process for decisions relating to child support matters

action when the outcome of a review is favourable, and

notice of decision to be given

the guidance and appeals panel.

Steps in the Centrelink review & appeal process

The Centrelink review and appeal process consists of internal and external review mechanisms. Individuals (

1.1.I.90

) have the right to seek a review if they are not satisfied with a decision of Centrelink.

Where an individual does not understand a decision, they can request an explanation of the decision, which will be provided by a subject matter expert (SME). Where an individual does not agree with a decision, they can apply for a formal review of the decision which will be undertaken by an

ARO

.

The levels of review and appeal include:

internal review process (Centrelink)

an explanation by an SME, and/or

a formal review by an ARO (

1.1.A.140

)

external review process

review by the

ART

second review by the ART

Federal Court appeal, and

High Court appeal.

Explanation:

A decision of the Federal Court can be challenged in the High Court, but only if the High Court grants leave to appeal.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 104 Decisions that may be reviewed by Secretary on own initiative, section 108 Decisions that may be reviewed under section 109A, section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant, section 109C Authorised review officers, section 111 Application for ART review

External reviews,

6.7

SIFS review & payment process

Review of FA decisions

All decisions made by Centrelink officers concerning

FTB

, FTB advances,

SIFS

,

CCS

and

ACCS

are reviewable through the Centrelink review and appeal process, unless specifically excluded under FA legislation. Reviews may be conducted at the individual's request (customer initiated review), or at the initiative of a Centrelink officer if it is considered that there are sufficient grounds for review (Secretary initiated review).

Example:

If a decision has been changed as a result of an SME explanation, and the individual is not satisfied with the outcome, they can apply for a formal review by an ARO.

Note:

Any reviews relating to decisions on FTB claims lodged with the

ATO

can only relate to income years up to and including the 2007-08 income year. This is because the option of receiving FTB as a lump sum payment through the ATO ceased on 1 July 2009.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 104 Decisions that may be reviewed by Secretary on own initiative, section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative, section 108 Decisions that may be reviewed under section 109A, section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant, section 109C Authorised review officers

Decisions made using computer programs

The Secretary may arrange for the use of computer programs in making decisions under FA law. Decisions made by computer programs are taken to be decisions made by the Secretary. This means, for example, where entitlement determinations are made using computer programs such as rate calculators, they can be reviewed as though those decisions were made by the Secretary or a delegate of the Secretary.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 223 Secretary may arrange for use of computer programs to make decisions

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4

Reconciliation

Review & appeal process for decisions relating to child support matters

See CS Guide

Part 10

for a description of child support objections and appeals processes.

Action when the outcome of a review is favourable

If an individual has a favourable outcome as the result of a review during a financial year, Centrelink issues a revised assessment notice for the remainder of the financial year. Centrelink cannot, however, determine their entitlement for the retrospective period until after the reconciliation process at the end of the financial year. At that time, Centrelink issues a credit or debit notice, depending on the relevant circumstances, for the whole year.

If an individual has a favourable outcome as the result of a review after the end of the financial year, Centrelink should re-determine their entitlement and pay the amount direct to the family.

Notice of decision to be given

Centrelink must provide notice of all internal review decisions to all parties affected by the decision. The notice of the decision must:

be in writing

state the effect of the decision, and

provide information about further rights of review.

The guidance & appeals panel

The guidance and appeals panel is a way of constituting the ART at a more senior level. The guidance and appeals panel is able to conduct reviews of some administrative decisions made by agencies and re-review decision made by the ART.

The guidance and appeals panel will broadly be constituted to consider matters where there is either an issue of significance to administrative decision-making, or the ART decision contains an error of fact or law that materially affects the decision.

Applications for review of family assistance decisions cannot be made directly to the guidance and appeals panel, as the ART already accommodates for two reviews of such decisions (ART review and ART second review). However, the President of the ART may refer an application for an ART review or second review of an eligible social services decision to the guidance and appeals panel on their own initiative.

2.1.1.85 Formal & informal care of an FTB child

Summary

This topic covers the payment of

FTB

in both formal foster care and other informal care situations using the following definitions:

Formal foster care involves a change in legal responsibility, usually to a state child welfare authority.

Informal care involves private voluntary arrangements such as those with grandparents, other carers who are family relations or family friends.

Explanations of these care arrangements are set out below.

Note:

These guidelines should be appropriate for the majority of foster and non-parent care cases. However, it is important that the full circumstances relating to each case are taken into account when making a determination for payment of FTB. In some situations, consideration should be given to the involvement of a Centrelink social worker.

Formal care

Most formal care is the responsibility of state and territory jurisdictions through their child protection agencies. Formal foster carers in the state/territory care and protection system,

ACO

s (

1.1.A.80

), as well as grandparents and non-parent carers, may be paid an allowance and supplementary payments, or be funded by the relevant authority. Other formal carers may have a parenting order made under family law, but these carers will usually be outside the state system, for example, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia orders the grandparent to have care of the child.

Formal care is where the change of care is legally authorised and involves a change in legal responsibility (whether day-to-day and/or long term). It needs to be supported by documentation from a state/territory child welfare authority or a court from another jurisdiction, for example, family law court from the federal jurisdiction. These documents from the state authority or the court order will determine who has the legal right to care for the child.

In formal care situations, FTB is payable from the date the child enters foster care, the care of an ACO or the care of a non-parent carer, for the relevant dates provided in the supporting documentation. If the child moves from one formal carer to another (for example, another foster carer), the FTB will follow the child and be paid to the new carer from that point in time.

Documentation to Centrelink may include:

an original letter on the letterhead of the state child welfare authority providing details on the child's placement with the carer and the relevant approved dates of placement, or

the relevant court orders if available.

Note:

A state or territory children's court order may not name the foster carer, and in this case a separate letter from the child welfare authority linking the carer with the child may still be needed.

Example:

Simon is removed from the care of their parent, Denise, by a state authority and is placed in temporary foster care with Tracey. The next day, the Children's Court orders that Simon remain in the care (legal responsibility) of the state welfare authority for a temporary period. Tracey provides a letter from the authority stating Simon is to remain in their care for 2 months. Tracey may therefore be eligible for FTB from the date the court makes its orders.

Example:

Brianna, aged 15, entered the care of a state welfare department on 1 October. On 3 October, the Children's Court made the following orders:

that legal responsibility for Brianna be allocated to the Minister until the age of 18 years

that the Minister be responsible for residence, financial and contact arrangements, and

that Brianna's parent be responsible for religion and have shared responsibility with the Minister for medical, educational and training arrangements.

Based on the court orders, the Minister gained legal responsibility for Brianna and Brianna's care is delegated to a foster carer. FTB would be payable to the foster carer who is providing care for Brianna from 3 October. If at a later date Brianna moves into the care of another foster carer, FTB may be payable to the second foster carer from the date care changes if they meet eligibility requirements. Therefore Brianna's parent has no eligibility for FTB.

Example:

On 16 November, a child protection worker removed Ava from their parents' care. Two days later, the Children's Court made an interim order that Ava be placed in the care of their maternal grandmother for a period of 6 months. In this period, Ava's parents assist with the costs of Ava's medication, clothing and pocket money to maintain a positive relationship with their daughter. Although Ava's parents assist with these costs, based on the orders made by the court, Ava's grandmother has legal responsibility for her day-to-day care, welfare and development. Therefore Ava's grandmother may be eligible to receive FTB from 18 November.

Example:

A state department removes a child from their parent in an emergency and makes an application to the Children's Court for a care order. After the application for the care order is served on the child's parents, the Registrar of the Court arranges a preliminary conference of the parties. At the preliminary conference, the parents and the department agree in principle to the making of an interim order where the child concerned is to be placed back with the parents under 'conditions' pending the return of the matter before the court. The interim order with respect to care is then made by the Children's Court magistrate in the terms agreed to by the parties. FTB will continue to be paid to the parents during this process.

Example:

The Children's Division of the Magistrate's Court makes an order for Shayla, aged 10 years, to be placed in the care of a state department. Shayla is placed with Fiona, a foster carer, but some time later the placement breaks down. A change of care occurs, and Shayla goes to live with another departmental foster carer, Kate. Both foster carers (Fiona and Kate) may be entitled to receive FTB for the relevant period that they had/have Shayla in their care.

Example:

On 3 October, Shane is arrested for shoplifting. On 4 October, Shane pleads guilty and is sentenced to 3 weeks in a Juvenile Correction Centre. As an ACO, the Juvenile Correction Centre is eligible for FTB to assist with the costs of Shane's care. During this time, Shane's parents will not have formal or legal care of Shane. As such, they will not be eligible for FTB for the 3 weeks starting 4 October until Shane is released on 24 October, assuming Shane returns to their parent's care.

Informal care

Informal care is a private arrangement between the parent and another party, where there is no change to any form of legal responsibility. Informal carers will usually be grandparents, other relatives or family friends. In informal care situations, who is eligible to receive FTB for a child depends on whether there has been a change of care or a delegation of care.

Delegation of care in informal care situations

Where an individual delegates the care of their child to another individual, FTB is not payable to the other individual. Common examples of delegated care include a child attending child care (either formal child care or care by a relative/friend), attending boarding school or staying with a grandparent, other relative or family friend.

The following circumstances should exist for a care arrangement to be considered a delegation of care:

The individual should retain overall responsibility for the child, including the ability to make major decisions about the child such as those relating to the child's health and education and the length of time they spend with the other carer.

The care arrangement should be short term and temporary (rather than open ended or ongoing). There should be a defined end date to the care arrangement. Where there is no documentary evidence that confirms when the care arrangement will end (such as a letter of from an employer, school), the intention of the individual should be considered.

The individual should be meeting, or at least substantially contributing to, the child's costs. This includes day-to-day costs (food, accommodation, transport etc.) and long term costs (school fees, clothing, health and dental care).

If the decision-maker cannot establish that delegation of care exists, it is likely that a change of care has occurred.

Example:

Kirsten travels interstate to spend the Christmas school holidays with their cousins. Kirsten is away from their parent's care for 5 weeks in total. Kirsten's parent has given them sufficient money to help pay their expenses, and remains involved in any decisions regarding the type of activities Kirsten is allowed to participate in while they are away. They talk on the phone every few days. Kirsten's parent retains overall responsibility for the child including the ability to make major decisions, the care arrangement is short-term and has a definite end date and her parent is meeting their day-to-day costs. This is considered to be a delegation of care and Kirsten continues to be an FTB child of her parent.

Example:

Eva, who is 3 years old, travels interstate with their mother, Anna, to visit their grandparents. After 8 weeks, Anna returns home as their leave from work has ended. Eva continues to stay with their grandparents for a total of 3 months so that they can get to know each other better. Anna has left sufficient money to cover Eva's expenses during Eva's stay with their grandparents. Eva's grandparents care for Eva, including preparing meals, bathing, and supervising and guiding them each day. However, they consult with Anna on any major decisions such as those relating to Eva's health. Anna will return at the end of the 3 month period to bring Eva home. Anna retains overall responsibility for Eva including the ability to make major decisions, the care arrangement can reasonably be considered short-term and has a definite end date and Anna is meeting Eva's day-to-day and long term costs. This is considered to be a delegation of care and Eva continues to be an FTB child of Anna.

Example:

Michael, who is the sole parent of Kyuss, was incarcerated for 6 months. During Michael's incarceration, Kyuss lives with their grandmother. Michael continues to make major decisions relating to Kyuss and made a contribution towards Kyuss' annual educational costs via a lump-sum payment prior to their incarceration. Although Michael retains some responsibility for Kyuss and made a contribution towards the child's long term costs, Kyuss' grandmother is substantially meeting the child's day-to-day costs and the care arrangement could not reasonably be considered short-term. This is not considered to be a delegation of care and Kyuss is an FTB child of their grandmother during Michael's incarceration.

Example:

Zadie, who is 14 years old, has behavioural difficulties, and their parents are unable to provide adequate support for Zadie as they are in the process of establishing a small business, which requires long hours away from home. Zadie's grandparents agree that Zadie will live with them until Zadie's behaviour is under control and their parent's business is able to run independently. Although Zadie's parents continue to make major decisions about Zadie and are substantially contributing to Zadie's day-to-day and long term costs, the care arrangement is open ended and does not have a definite end date. This is not considered to be a delegation of care and Zadie is an FTB child of their grandparents while their parents' circumstances stabilise.

Change of care

If it cannot be established that delegation of care exists, it is likely that a change of care has occurred. Whether FTB can be paid to the new carer will depend on whether the care is of a temporary and short term or an ongoing nature.

Temporary & short term care

Where possible, FTB should be paid to the individual who has the care of a child. However, in some situations, FTB may continue to be paid to a parent who does not have the care of a child. For example, if the change of care is temporary, short term, and informal and the intention is that the child will return to the parent within a short period, the parent will continue to be paid FTB. However in all but the most extenuating circumstances, the total temporary and short-term absence for FTB purposes, should not exceed 4 weeks. After this period, the actual carer should receive the FTB, provided they are eligible and entitled. The continued payment of FTB beyond a 4-week absence to the parent could only occur if the parent's involvement in the child's care increased to a sufficient degree.

If a state agency facilitates the placement of a child but does not gain legal responsibility, it is considered informal care. This occurs as parents are assisted to have respite or place their child in short-term care, and may include placements in the care of grandparents or relatives.

Example:

Belinda has 2 young children. One of the children has a severe disability. Respite care facilitated by the state government has been arranged for that child for a period of 2 weeks so that Belinda can have a break from their intensive caring responsibilities. Belinda still has legal responsibility for the children, so this is an informal care arrangement. As the arrangement is short term and temporary and Belinda continues to be responsible for major decisions relating to the children, Belinda continues to be eligible for FTB for both children.

Example:

Terri is a single parent of her 12 year old child, Jack. Terri is being hospitalised and will not be able to care for Jack. Terri makes arrangements for Jack to be cared for by a friend of the family for a period of 3 weeks while they receive treatment for their illness. As the arrangement is short term and temporary and Terri continues to be responsible for major decisions relating to Jack, Terri continues to be eligible for FTB for Jack.

Example:

Janet has a 4-week old baby, Louise. Janet suffers from post-natal depression and has a major depressive episode. Louise is considered to be at risk however the state child welfare department is not taking any court action as Janet's parent has undertaken to care for Louise for a period of 4 weeks while Janet receives treatment. As it is not a care and protection order, this is an informal care arrangement. As the arrangement is short term and temporary, and is less than 4 weeks, Janet continues to be eligible for FTB for Louise.

There may be situations where the care is temporary and short term or the period of care is unknown and the parent does not want to be paid FTB. In this case the new carer will be eligible for FTB from the date the child enters their care provided the relevant eligibility criteria are met.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.60

Change of care of an FTB child

Ongoing care

When it is clear from the outset that a child will be in ongoing care, then the carer will be eligible for FTB from the date the child enters their care. When care has been on a temporary and short-term basis and it subsequently becomes ongoing, a change of care applies at the point it becomes ongoing and FTB may be payable.

Example:

Sean is a single parent caring for their 14 year old child, Zack. Sean has had to go into rehabilitation for 3 months. While Sean is in rehabilitation, it is agreed within the family that Zack will be cared for by their aunt, including meeting the costs relating to Zack's care and making major decisions about their wellbeing without input from Sean. In this case, Zack's aunt may be eligible for FTB from the date Zack enters her care.

Example:

Following an abusive relationship, Sharon is unable to care for their 3 children and agrees to leave the children in the care of their paternal grandparents. Although no timeframe has been set, it is considered an ongoing arrangement. The grandparents may become eligible for FTB from the date the children enter their care.

Example:

Nancy lives in the same house as their daughter, Kylie, who is dependent on drugs and is unable to care for their 4 children. The children are being cared for by Nancy who makes a claim for FTB, as Kylie is unable to care for the children due to their drug dependence. Nancy may be eligible to receive FTB. It is likely that there will need to be social work involvement in this case to confirm the circumstances or other independent evidence, such as medical evidence regarding Kylie's capacity as a drug user to care for the children. In most situations, except where a parent can be shown to have lost their capacity to care for the child or exercise legal responsibility for the child, they would continue to be entitled to receive FTB.

Example:

On 20 January, Thomas is placed with their grandmother for a period of 3 weeks while their parent has a short break. On 10 February, Thomas's parent feels they are still unable to care for Thomas and Thomas remains with their grandmother for a further 6 months. Although the intention for Thomas to return to their parent remains unchanged, their grandmother may be eligible to receive FTB from 10 February.

Where the arrangements for the care of the child were to be ongoing but there is a change in circumstances where the child is returned to the parent after a short period of time, the parent is paid from the date the child returns to their care.

Example:

On 4 July, Josh goes to live with their aunt and uncle while their parent receives counselling and support. It was intended that Josh would stay for a period of 4 months and that the aunt and uncle would meet their costs during this period. After 3 weeks, Josh returns to the care of their parent. FTB may be paid to the aunt or uncle from 4 July for 3 weeks. The FTB is then paid to Josh's parent once they regain care of Josh.

14-week qualification period

FTB may continue to be paid to an individual after that individual loses care of an FTB child. The maximum qualification period during which FTB can continue to be paid is 14 weeks.

The 14-week qualification period is only intended to apply in circumstances where children are removed from their legally responsible parents' care without any legal authority, for example, abduction, the child is missing or the child is absent without the parent's consent. The intention is to allow FTB to be paid for a further 14 weeks despite the fact that the parent may not have actual 'care' of the child concerned, provided the parent is taking reasonable steps to regain care of the child.

Note:

Where there is a care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

) in place and the parent is taking reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with, an interim period (

1.1.I.105

) may apply (

2.1.1.70

).

The 14-week qualification period is not intended to apply in cases where the child is taken by state or territory welfare authorities, as removal by the state under relevant child protection legislation has legal authority.

Example:

Gareth is the sole parent of 2 children, Nicholas and James. The state welfare authority is notified of a possible care and protection concern by a neighbour, and the authority investigates and obtains a court order placing Nicholas and James into full-time ongoing care with a foster carer. Gareth objects to the children being taken away and complains to the Department and takes legal action to have the children returned. In these circumstances, FTB cannot be paid to Gareth as they have lost legal responsibility for the children and the foster carer would qualify for payment from the date the order was put into place.

Disputed care arrangements

Shared care of a foster child

Where there is an established pattern of care, both the foster carer and the original carer can qualify for FTB, even if another individual or organisation has the legal responsibility for the child. Therefore, if the care of the child is being shared between the foster carer and another individual (usually the parent), the normal shared care rules can be applied. A minimum of 35% care must be established for each carer during the care period (

1.1.C.100

).

5.2.3 Information required for past period claims - former partners

Introduction

This section covers requirements relating to instances where a former partner of an individual notifies Centrelink about a previous change of circumstances.

Changes of circumstances notified by former partner

When an individual (

1.1.I.90

) is paid

FTB

for a past period before separating from their partner (

1.1.P.30

), and their former partner (

1.1.F.40

) advises of changes in circumstances for the period before the separation, the details should be confirmed with the individual. If the individual disputes a reported change Centrelink should investigate whether the change has occurred. This will ensure the individual receives their correct entitlement.

Explanation:

Changes in circumstance could be changes to family, income (

1.1.I.20

) or personal circumstances. The details of changes in circumstances need to be confirmed to ensure that the instalment individual receives their correct FTB entitlement. Information to be verified could include the date of separation and/or care arrangements.

3.1.4.20 Standard rate - FTB Part A Method 1

Standard rate

An individual's standard rate (

1.1.S.103

) is the sum of their

FTB

child rates (

1.1.F.57

).

The standard rate is added to the individual's rate of

ES

Part A,

MBA

, FTB Part A supplement and

RA

to arrive at the individual's maximum rate (

1.1.M.26

). The income test and maintenance income tests are applied to the maximum rate to calculate the individual's rate of FTB Part A. The FTB Part A supplement is not paid until after the end of the financial year after FTB reconciliation, and is only paid to families with adjusted taxable income of $80,000 or less.

Note:

The ES ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. For individuals who became new recipients of FTB after 20 September 2016, they will no longer be paid ES after 19 March 2017. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

When an individual or their partner receives a periodic payment under a law of the Commonwealth or under a scheme administered by the Commonwealth that provides for an increase in the rate of payment by reference to an FTB child, they are only entitled to the base FTB child rate for that child.

Explanation:

A periodic payment under a law/scheme of the Commonwealth includes:

Agreement pensions (

1.1.A.60

) paid under the SSAct, and

Service pensions paid under the

Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986

.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 9 FTB child rate - recipient of other periodic payments

Effect of shared care

For FTB Part A, if a determination has been made because care of an FTB child is shared, the percentage of care is used to determine the FTB shared care percentage and applied to the FTB child rate for that child before the individual's standard rate of FTB Part A is calculated.

A shared care determination does not apply to sharing FTB for a:

blended family, or

separated couple who claim FTB for a past period prior to separation.

Explanation:

In these situations, the payment of FTB is shared after the total rate has been calculated.

. Grounds for granting an exemption and the types of exemptions are discussed in this topic.

Reasons for granting an exemption

The following table summarises the circumstances in which an exemption from the requirement to make a TFN statement may be possible.

If the person is …

TFN requirements for FTB

Notification of exemption

If a request for exemption from the TFN requirements is refused, the individual must be advised in writing, as the claim is ineffective if the TFN requirements are not met.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.2.4.30

Claim action 3 - TFN not provided

Claim for FTB under normal circumstances

There are no grounds for exempting the individual from providing their own TFN for a normal claim. The individual is required to make a TFN statement in order for the claim to be effective.

Exemption from providing partner's TFN statement

A TFN statement for the individual's partner or their former partner is not required if the individual cannot:

obtain the partner's TFN, or

obtain an authorisation from the partner for the

ATO

to provide the TFN.

Types of exemptions

TFN exemptions for FTB are grouped into 2 types as explained in the following table.

Type of exemption

Explanation

Indefinite

Appropriate where the reason the individual is unable to comply with the TFN requirement is not likely to change in the foreseeable future.

Possible reasons for an exemption include that the partner is:

violent (

1.1.F.15

) (referral to a social worker or

ISO

is required)

imprisoned for life

seriously ill or disabled.

Example:

Simone does not know their partner's TFN. Simone's partner has a severe disability following an accident that prevents them from working again. Simone's partner does not have any other source of income. It is not expected that Simone's partner will ever have to lodge another tax return. An indefinite exemption may be granted.

Temporary

Appropriate where the individual is expected to be able to comply with the TFN requirements after a specified period for which exemption is granted.

Possible reasons for an exemption include that the partner is:

away from home for work or a holiday

in prison with a known release date

missing whereabouts unknown (if still missing after 12 months the exemption can be made indefinite).

Example:

Jenny has made a claim for FTB. Jenny does not know their partner's TFN, and their partner is overseas for 2 months. Jenny can be temporarily exempted from providing their partner's TFN, but must still provide their own TFN. A review date is set to follow up Jenny's partner's TFN upon their return to Australia.

Partner violent

An indefinite exemption can be granted where an individual has a reason to believe that, as a result of their request to the partner for TFN information:

the partner could become violent to the individual or a child, or

there would be other concerns for the safety or the health of the individual or a child.

Referral to a social worker or ISO is required for family violence exemptions.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 8(7) Exemption from tax file number requirement

No exemption where TFN not required for tax purposes

There are no grounds for exempting the individual or their partner from having a TFN if it is only because they do not require a TFN for tax purposes. They are required to obtain a TFN for FTB purposes.

Example:

Claudia is an Australian citizen and claims FTB for their new baby. Claudia's partner is a New Zealand citizen living with them in Australia. Claudia's partner works for the New Zealand Department of Defence and is not required to pay Australian income tax. Claudia is not exempted from the requirement to provide their partner's TFN for FTB.

Partner's TFN - refusal to supply

An indefinite exemption is not granted in cases where there is only a refusal on the part of the partner to provide the information and there are no violence or health concerns.

A referral should be made to a social worker or ISO for:

assistance for the individual, and

advice on the request for exemption.

Declining to provide a TFN statement is not an offence, but the applicant's FTB claim may not be effective or their FTB payment may cease to be payable if a TFN statement is not provided.

Bereavement claim

Where the individual is making a claim in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for FTB, the individual is required to provide the TFN of the deceased person and the deceased person's partner.

Explanation:

Eligibility for FTB for this type of claim is based on the circumstances of the deceased person, not the individual.

The deceased person's partner can satisfy the TFN requirement by making a TFN statement asking the ATO to notify the Secretary of the partner's TFN.

If the individual is unable to provide the deceased person's TFN, or the partner's TFN statement, an exemption from providing a TFN may be granted if:

it would be unduly difficult or distressing to the individual, or

distressing to the deceased person's partner.

If the deceased person was receiving FTB by instalment or had previously made an effective past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) before their death, they will have already satisfied the TFN requirements. If the deceased person had not claimed FTB, the individual will be required to provide income details for the deceased person and their partner. In this case it is likely that the individual may also gain access to the TFNs.

3.1.7.10 Maintenance income test - general provisions

Summary

This topic provides general information about the maintenance income test for

FTB

Part A, including the following:

general principles of the maintenance income test

review of child support entitlement - maintenance income taken to have not been received

maintenance income free area (

1.1.M.21

)

maintenance income for members of a couple (

1.1.M.50

)

maintenance income for more than one child, and

individuals receiving social security payments (

1.1.S.80

).

Note:

For guidance on what constitutes maintenance income for the purposes of the maintenance income test, see

1.1.M.10

,

3.1.7.11

,

3.1.7.12

and

3.1.7.13

.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'maintenance income'

General principles of the maintenance income test

The maintenance income test:

assesses whether an individual's maintenance income is greater than their

MIFA

, and

reduces the rate of FTB Part A by 50c for every dollar of maintenance over the MIFA until the base rate (

1.1.B.10

) is reached (the maintenance income test only affects the amount of FTB Part A over the base rate).

Maintenance income received for a child only reduces the FTB paid for that child.

Maintenance income received during the financial year is assessed for that year. This means that arrears are assessed in the financial year they are received, even if they relate to a previous financial year. The exception is when it relates to a private collect period for which a deemed amount applies. For details on when a deemed amount applies see

3.1.6.70

and

3.1.5.55

.

Example:

John has not received his full entitlement to maintenance for 4 years. In January of the current year, Child Support garnishees the payer's tax return and John receives arrears of $5,000. The whole amount is assessed for the current financial year as it was received in that year.

Note:

In the case of arrears, individuals who have registered their child support for collection with Child Support may be able to access their

MIC

balance (

3.1.7.05

).

Maintenance income is estimated during the financial year for individuals receiving FTB as instalments (

1.1.I.100

) as the actual amount collected is not known until reconciliation occurs. The actual amount of maintenance received is assessed for past period claims (

1.1.P.60

) (except if there is a notional assessment, see

3.1.7.14

).

Review of child support entitlement - maintenance income taken to have not been received

In some circumstances, the maintenance income received by an individual can be taken to not have been received. For instance, where an individual's child support entitlement for a particular income year is subsequently reviewed and revised downward by Child Support. Where this occurs, it means that the individual's FTB entitlement has been assessed on the basis of an amount of maintenance that they are now required to repay to the payer because of the revision by Child Support.

In these situations the individual can request a review of their FTB entitlement for the entitlement year in which they received the maintenance. If their request for review of their FTB entitlement is successful, the maintenance they are required to repay to the payer is considered never to have been received and therefore not subject to the maintenance income test. The individual's FTB entitlement for that year is adjusted accordingly. The request for review of their FTB entitlement must meet review timeframes in order to get full effect (

6.2

).

Example:

Violet received maintenance income of $5,000 during the 2022-23 year based on an assessment by Child Support. In April 2024 Child Support receives up to date income information for the payer relating to the 2022-23 year and reviews the payer's child support assessment. As a result, the payer's assessed amount of maintenance for the 2022-23 year is reduced to $2,000 and Violet is required to repay $3,000 of maintenance received to the payer.

Violet's FTB entitlement for the 2022-23 year was assessed and paid on the basis of the original child support assessment of $5,000. As this no longer accurately reflects the amount of maintenance that Violet received, she seeks a review in May 2024 of her FTB entitlement for the 2022-23 year. Violet's review is successful and the $3,000 in maintenance she is required to repay is taken to never have been received and not subject to the maintenance income test. Violet's FTB entitlement for the 2022-23 year is adjusted accordingly and she receives arrears of FTB for that year.

An individual who is privately collecting their child support entitlement is deemed to be receiving their full entitlement. If they actually receive less than their full entitlement, any arrears received at a later date that relate to the deemed period are not counted when they are actually received. This is because the arrears have been deemed to have been received in the income year to which they relate.

Example:

Wendy privately collects her child support assessment and is assessed to collect $4,000 in the 2022-23 financial year. While Wendy is only able to collect $2,000 from her ex-partner, as she privately collects her child support she is still deemed to have received the full $4,000 for the 2022-23 year. In 2023-24, Wendy has a new child support assessment amount of $1,000. Wendy is actually collecting $3,000, which is her $1,000 ongoing plus the $2,000 she is owed from the payer for the previous financial year. As Wendy was deemed to have received the full $4,000 for 2022-23, the $2,000 arrears she is collecting does not affect her in 2023-24.

Maintenance income free area

The MIFA is the amount of maintenance income that is disregarded under the maintenance income test. See

3.1.1.20

for the current annual MIFA and the amount allowed for each additional FTB child attracting child support.

When calculating MIFA, the following children are excluded:

children who are 16 years and older who are not senior secondary children, and

children who do not attract child support.

Both members of a couple must be receiving child support from former partners for children in their care to be eligible for the partnered MIFA amount.

Example:

Both Troy and Simone receive child support from their former partners for children in their care. Troy receives child support for Kylie who is 8, and Blair who is 10, while Simone receives child support for Brooke, who is 17 and has completed her year 12 or equivalent qualification. Only Troy's children will be taken into account when calculating the MIFA, as Simone's daughter is more than 16 years old and is not a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

). Therefore, their MIFA amount for the 2023-24 year is $2,511.20 (which is the sum of $1,883.40 and $627.80 for one additional child).

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 22 How to calculate an individual's maintenance income free area, Schedule 1 clause 23 Only maintenance actually received taken into account in applying clause 22

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.1.20

Current FTB rates & income test amounts

Maintenance income received by members of a couple

When both members of a couple receive maintenance income, those incomes are added, and the total amount is used when applying the maintenance income test.

Example:

Mark receives child support of $1,500 annually and Tracey receives child support of $2,500 annually from their former partners. Tracey receives FTB for all the children in their blended family (

1.1.B.30

). A maintenance income test ceiling is calculated using the FTB of Mark's children. The lower of the maintenance income test ceiling (

3.1.7.03

) and the child support amount of $1,500 is used in the maintenance income test. A similar calculation and comparison is made for Tracey's children.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 21 Maintenance income of members of couple to be added

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7.03

Maintenance income test ceiling

Maintenance income for more than one child

If the individual or their partner receives child support for more than one child from a payer, it is assumed that the child support is divided equally for those children unless specifically stated otherwise by a:

court order

child support agreement (

1.1.M.15

)

Child Support Review Officer, or

payee (

1.1.P.71

).

Example:

Centrelink is advised by Child Support that the payee is entitled to $20,000 for 4 children. This amount is split between the 4 children ($5,000 each). The payee provides Centrelink with a letter showing that due to the level of care for the individual children $4,000 each is applicable to the 3 youngest children and $8,000 is applicable to the payee's 17 year old senior secondary school child.

Individuals receiving social security payments

Maintenance income is not assessed under the income tests for social security payments.

1.1.A.10 Absence from Australia

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, the individual (

1.1.I.90

) or child is absent from Australia (

1.1.A.120

) if they are outside of Australia.

The day a person departs Australia is counted as the first day of absence from Australia.

The day a person arrives back in Australia counts as a day in Australia.

Example:

Jane departs Australia on 12 October 2017 at 11 am and arrives in Japan on the same day. She subsequently returns a week later on 19 October 2017 at 1 pm. As such, Jane is considered absent from Australia from 12 October 2017 until 18 October 2017.

4.15.3 Payment of SBP

Introduction

This section explains the payment arrangements for

SBP

. It includes:

access to payment

bank account for payment, and

payment for multiple births.

Access to payment

Eligible individuals are paid SBP in a single lump sum. Payment is made on the earliest day practicable.

SBP cannot be paid through the tax system, but the payment can be remitted to the

ATO

to offset outstanding ATO debts.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

SBP eligibility

Bank account for payment

If the individual has claimed instalments of

FTB

, payment of SBP is made to the account nominated for FTB. If the individual is not receiving or claiming FTB instalments, they should nominate an account for payment. In some cases the individual may be paid by other means. Payment should generally be made into an account nominated and maintained by the individual, but can also be paid to the individual's payment nominee.

Payment for multiple births

SBP can be paid for each stillborn child in a multiple birth. As SBP is only payable for a child where neither the individual nor their partner has received or is receiving

PLP

for that child, individuals may elect to receive PLP for one child and SBP for another child or children of the same multiple birth. If eligible, the individual would receive SBP as a lump sum and PLP as instalment payments.

Example:

Amanda is pregnant and currently working and has lodged a pre-claim for both PLP and

FA

for twins she is expecting within the next 3 months. On delivery, one child is stillborn. After the birth, it is determined that PLP is payable to Amanda for her live child. It is also determined that Amanda is entitled to be paid SBP for her stillborn child. Amanda will receive SBP for the stillborn child and separately receive PLP for the live child.

4.3.6 Payments to a third party

Summary

In certain circumstances, payments of

FTB

,

CCS

and

ACCS

can be paid to a third party on behalf of the individual (

1.1.I.90

). As some individuals are vulnerable to exploitation, this should be done in a way that does not conflict with the intention of the inalienability provisions of the FA(Admin)Act. The inalienability rule will not be infringed where payments are made in accordance with a payment nominee arrangement. Processes should, as far as possible, put individuals in control of their own finances.

Note:

Inalienability is not infringed by Centrelink appointing a nominee (

1.1.N.20

) on behalf of an individual. Under the nominee provisions in the

FA

law, the consent of an individual is not required.

In practice, a person who is eligible for FTB is unlikely to be in a situation where payment should be directed to a third party. If a third party arrangement is needed, it is likely that the person is unable to provide enough care for a child to meet the FTB child eligibility requirements and so careful consideration should be given before making these arrangements.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 66 Protection of payments under this Part, section 66(2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to …, section 67GB Protection of payments in relation to CCS and ACCS, section 67GB(2) Subsection (1) has effect subject to the following provisions …

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.1.2

Protection of payment

Circumstances where payment can be made to another person or party

Payment to another person (

1.1.P.80

) or party should only occur if:

there is a group payment arrangement (that is an agency arrangement such as Centrepay)

the payment is in accordance with a payment nominee arrangement, or

the individual is incapable of managing their financial affairs and there is a formal guardianship arrangement (including court appointed arrangements).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 219TB Appointment of payment nominee

Payment nominees

An individual who wants their payments, including advance payments, to go to another person on an ongoing basis has the option of proposing a payment nominee. However, a nominee must be appointed by Centrelink. In determining whether to appoint a payment nominee, consideration should be given to the circumstances of the individual and other avenues of payments to a third party to ensure that a nominee arrangement is the correct arrangement for the individual. The nominee must consent to being a nominee. Centrelink must consider the individual’s wishes before making the appointment, except where the nominee is being appointed as a result of a security notice.

While Centrelink generally needs to take into account the individual’s wishes before making an appointment, ultimately the individual does not have to consent or accept the appointment.

4.4.2.10 Change in non-income related circumstances

Introduction

This topic explains the dates of effect to apply to non-income related changes in circumstances. These changes in circumstances may result in a rate increase, decrease or cancellation of

FTB

.

Examples

of non-income related changes in circumstances include:

birth of a subsequent child

child leaves care

partnering

separation

permanently leaving Australia, and

child ceasing to be a senior secondary school child.

Treatment of changes

Where an individual receiving fortnightly instalments has a non-income related change in circumstances, a retrospective determination can be made and a top-up amount issued, as appropriate. Where an unfavourable result is produced from a retrospective determination, a debt may occur.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

7.1.2

FA debts - individuals & ACOs

Date of effect of non-income related changes where retrospectivity involved

The following table outlines the date of effect of favourable and unfavourable non-income related changes.

If a non-income related change in circumstances resulting in a …

is notified …

the date of effect of the reassessment is …

favourable determination

before the end of the financial year after the financial year in which the change occurred

the date the change in circumstances occurred.

Example:

On 1 July (financial year 2), Simone informs Centrelink of the birth of her third child. The child was born 10 August (financial year 1). As the effect of the change is favourable and the individual notified Centrelink of the change in circumstances before the end of financial year 2, which is before 30 June, the date of effect of the reassessment is 10 August, the date of the change.

favourable determination

after the end of the financial year after the financial year in which the change occurred

the beginning of the financial year before the financial year in which the individual notifies of a change in circumstances.

Example:

Simone informs Centrelink of the birth of their third child on 1 July (financial year 3). The child was born 10 August (financial year 1). As the effect of the change is favourable and the individual did not inform Centrelink before the end of financial year 2 the date of effect of the reassessment is 1 July, the start of financial year 2.

unfavourable determination

at any time

the date of the change in circumstances.

Example:

Mary advises she no longer provides care to her sole FTB child. The date of effect of the cancellation of FTB is the date her child left her care. A debt is raised for the period she received FTB after the child left her care.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 31 Variation of instalment entitlement determination to reflect changes in eligibility, section 71 Debts in respect of family assistance other than CCS, ACCS and FTB advance

Partnering & separation

Where an individual advises of a change in their relationship status due to partnering or separation it is regarded as a non-income related change of circumstances. This is because it is a change of circumstances occurring at a particular time as opposed to revising an estimate of income. If an individual also revises their estimate of income at the same time as notifying the change in relationship status, 2 different dates of effect may apply in reassessing FTB entitlement.

Example:

Mary advises on 20 April that she separated from her partner on 10 April. The reassessment of her FTB resulting from the removal of her partner's income applies from 10 April. At the same time she revises the estimate of her own income. The reassessment of her FTB to take into account her revised estimate applies from 20 April.

2.8.2.50 ACCS (grandparent) - evidentiary requirements

Summary

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) is required to provide evidence to support their application for

ACCS

(grandparent).

An individual applying for ACCS (grandparent) is required to provide evidence of:

their grandparent relationship to the child, and

their principal care arrangements

that they have all or at least 65% of ongoing daily care, and

substantial autonomy for day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development.

This topic provides an overview of the evidentiary requirements for ACCS (grandparent) and covers:

best evidence

use of third party evidence

evidence for grandparent relationship

evidence for principal care.

Best evidence

Generally, grandparents will have access to documentary evidence or other forms of evidence from third parties who can support their ACCS (grandparent) application regardless of whether it is a formal or informal arrangement. However, there may be circumstances where they:

do not have evidence readily available as they are providing care in an emergency situation, or

have not been caring for their grandchild for long enough and as a result cannot obtain the evidence from a third party. That is, the third party cannot confirm the existence of an established carer relationship or responsibility for decision making. In cases such as these, a grandparent may use a statutory declaration.

The list of types of evidence below are acceptable. Not all will be relevant to each circumstance so grandparents should provide the most relevant to their caring arrangement with their grandchild.

Evidence such as a family court order, custody order, parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

) or family law order (

1.1.F.10

).

Third party evidence such as a letter from the child's school or general practitioner, receipts from medical expenses or statement from social worker which may be evidence to support an informal arrangement.

Where a grandparent cannot supply other evidence, they can provide a statutory declaration.

If a grandparent relationship or principal care arrangement has already been established as part of another family assistance claim and third party evidence to support this has already been provided and meets the requirement for ACCS (grandparent), there is no requirement for individuals to provide third party evidence again as part of an application for ACCS (grandparent).

Example:

Centrelink already holds a copy of a court order that gives a grandparent guardianship of their grandchild until the child turns 18. This existing evidence can be used for ACCS (grandparent) purposes.

Use of third party evidence

The following types of third party evidence may be considered, noting that other third party evidence may be considered on a case-by-case basis:

Letter from the child's general practitioner, or other allied health provider, stating the grandparent is responsible for the child's medical care and expenses.

Letter from a pharmacist stating the grandparent pays for prescriptions for their grandchild and/or seek advice for managing their grandchild's health.

Letter from the child's school stating that the grandparent is the person to call regarding decisions about their grandchild's schooling, including the child's wellbeing while at school.

Receipts from medical expenses, travel, school uniforms etc.

Evidence that the grandparent has a

CWA

(

1.1.C.52

) with the child care service (

1.1.A.90

) and pays for child care. If the grandparent does not have a CWA and is not paying for child care, they cannot be eligible for ACCS (grandparent). Having a CWA and paying for child care is not sufficient evidence by itself that the grandparent meets eligibility requirements.

Evidence for grandparent relationship

Evidence is required to make the determination that a grandparent relationship exists.

Evidence for grandparent relationship includes, but is not limited to:

family court order or custody order

parenting plan or order

birth certificates of the grandparent's own children and their children

a combination of birth certificates and marriage certificates for step-grandparents

adoption papers to prove relationship

artificial conception or surrogacy documentation where the child has not been adopted or does not hold an Australian passport, in the cases of international surrogacy

ACCS (grandparent) specific statutory declaration.

Circumstances where a grandparent is required to demonstrate their relationship, where it involves surrogacy, are likely to be rare and complex. Please contact the Department of Education for consideration.

Evidence for principal care

Evidence is required to make a determination that the grandparent is the principal carer (has all or at least 65% care AND substantial autonomy to make decisions about the child's care, welfare and development).

Evidence for principal care includes, but is not limited to:

family court order

custody order

parenting plan or order

foster care placement (if the child is 'at risk' (

1.1.A.110

) and as a result, the grandparent is the foster carer, the child may also be eligible of ACCS (child wellbeing))

court order for graduated return to care where child is being integrated back into the family

where formal care arrangements do not exist, a letter from child's school, general practitioner or other third party (who has regular dealing with the family and can independently verify the circumstances) stating the grandparent has responsibility for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development

statutory declaration in limited circumstances.

Third party evidence is preferred over a statutory declaration, to ensure the reliability of the percentage of care and substantial autonomy, given the significant financial benefit provided by ACCS (grandparent). However, a statutory declaration is sufficient in certain circumstances.

Grandparent principal carers, not in receipt of an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) and therefore not eligible for ACCS (grandparent), will be entitled to 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight, provided they meet the same evidentiary requirements applying to ACCS (grandparent).

1.1.M.50 Member of a couple

Summary

This topic provides information about the term 'member of a couple'. It discusses:

the definition of member of a couple, and

multiple relationships.

Definition

The term 'member of a couple' has the same meaning under the FAAct as under the SSAct.

An individual is a member of a couple with another individual under the SSAct if they are:

legally married or in a registered relationship and not living apart on a permanent or indefinite basis, or

in a de facto relationship and are over the age of consent and not in a prohibited relationship.

In determining if an individual is a member of a couple, consideration must be given to the following 5 factors:

the financial aspects of the relationship

the nature of the household

the social aspects of the relationship

any sexual relationship between the individuals, and

the nature of the individual's commitment to each other.

Multiple relationships

The Australian social security system generally does not recognise the existence of multiple relationships, regardless of whether they were formed within Australia or overseas. Where a person declares they are part of a multiple relationship their circumstances should be considered under section 24 of the SSAct.

Where an individual has more than one partner, the individual should be considered to be in a relationship with the person they are either legally married to, or in a registered relationship with. Where the individual is not married or in a registered relationship, the relationship that commenced earliest will be recognised for social security purposes.

Where other individuals with children that are part of the relationship are regarded as single, the

MAT

will not apply to them for

FTB

purposes. This is because they are not entitled to apply for maintenance as they are considered to be in a relationship with the other parent for child support purposes.

Note:

In some circumstances, an individual's

FTB

may be affected by a pending appeal and/or review of a Child Support decision.

Review of Child Support decisions by the

ART

Parents are able to apply to the ART for review of most Child Support objection decisions.

See CS Guide

Part 10

for further information in relation to child support objections and appeals processes.

Privacy & confidentiality issues

It is not a breach of privacy to acknowledge that both parties have rights with a review or appeal of a Child Support percentage of care decision and staff may discuss the situation with both parties, even when one party is not an

FA

individual. However, such discussions should be in general terms and care should be taken not to breach the privacy and confidentiality of the FA individual.

Appeal procedures

An appeal against a decision made by a Centrelink officer should follow normal appeal procedures. Payment of more than the base rate of FTB should continue pending resolution.

Summary

This chapter explains Centrelink's internal review process and covers:

initiating a review

Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review

date of effect and result of favourable decision for Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review

reviews relating to the

CCS

subsidised hours result

reviews initiated by affected persons (

review relating to care percentage decisions - initiated by affected persons

time limit for a review initiated by affected persons

date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected person

further requirement for an application for review relating to an income estimate

continuation of payment during a review, and

notification of the decision.

Initiating a review

An internal review can be initiated by:

Centrelink (as a delegate of the Secretary), or

a person affected by a Centrelink decision.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative, section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant

Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review

Centrelink may review an

FA

decision where there is sufficient reason to do so. The delegated officer may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision. This includes deemed refusals, where Centrelink has neither made a determination nor refused the original application for

ACCS

(child wellbeing) (

2.8.1.50

) or (temporary financial hardship) (

2.8.3.40

) within 28 days after the day of application. Centrelink will undertake a Secretary initiated review in circumstances where an application:

has been made and received

meets the 'form and manner' requirement, and

contains the required information and accompanying documentation.

Example:

Reconciliation of entitlement is one example of a review initiated by Centrelink.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 105 Secretary may review certain decisions on own initiative, section 105A Review of determination or variation—taking account of FTB Part A supplement or FTB Part B supplement, section 104 Decisions that may be reviewed by Secretary on own initiative

Date of effect & result of favourable decision for Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review

Generally, where the review is initiated by Centrelink, the date of effect of a review decision that is favourable to the person affected by the decision is the date from which full effect is given to the review decision (full arrears).

FTB

by instalment or

SBP

However, if the review decision relates to FTB by instalment, or SBP (paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test), and the decision is made on a date later than 52 weeks after the person concerned was given notice of the original decision, then the date that the review decision comes into effect is the later of:

the date from which full arrears are payable, or

1 July of the income year before the income year in which the review decision is made.

Explanation:

For decisions in all cases listed above, full arrears are payable if the review decision is made before the end of the income year following the income year that contains the first day of the period to which the original decision relates. Otherwise, arrears can only be paid back to the beginning of the income year prior to the income year in which the review decision is made.

The limitation on the date of effect does not apply where a review of the decision was triggered because the reconciliation conditions were met (including FTB by instalment cases), because an individual and/or their partner’s tax return/s were lodged, or because the individual notified Centrelink of their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) because they and/or their partner were not required to lodge an income tax return, by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

). The limitation on the date of effect also does not apply in cases of re-reconciliation. That is, if the income used in reconciliation for an income year is retrospectively changed (for example, the Commissioner of Taxation makes an amended notice of assessment), increased amounts of FTB can be paid if the reconciliation conditions for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) were originally met by the end of the lodgement year.

Explanation:

For decisions relating to the individual's income (including reconciliation and re-reconciliation), full arrears are payable where reconciliation conditions are met before the end of the lodgement year, even if Centrelink does not make a review decision until after the lodgement year.

Outcomes of reconciliation

CCS & ACCS

For Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review decisions in relation to individuals' (

1.1.I.90

) eligibility and entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) for CCS or ACCS, or an approved provider's (

1.1.A.90

) entitlement to be paid ACCS (wellbeing), the date of effect for beneficial changes cannot be earlier than the beginning of the previous financial year. This time limit does not apply where a decision on review:

changes an individual's ATI for the relevant income year, or the individual's subsidised hours result for a CCS fortnight due to the individual meeting the CCS reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

) conditions, or

is affected by a review conducted by the

ATO

.

Note:

If an individual reports a change to their combined annual estimated ATI after the change occurred (whether it is favourable or unfavourable), a review of entitlement is not undertaken, as actual CCS entitlement based on actual ATI is confirmed at reconciliation.

Overview of reconciliation

Reviews relating to the CCS subsidised hours result

Individuals are obliged to notify Centrelink as soon as practicable if there is a change in their participation that would cause them to move to a different subsidised hours result. An individual must also notify Centrelink as soon as practicable if there is a change in their circumstances that would mean they are no longer eligible for an exemption, or would now be eligible for an exemption to reporting recognised participation.

For Centrelink (Secretary) initiated review decisions relating to participation notified after the change occurred:

A change in participation level that is FAVOURABLE to the individual (that is, that causes the individual to be entitled to more hours of subsidised care per fortnight), will be backdated a maximum of 28 days to the beginning of a CCS fortnight from the date of notification.

A change in participation level that is UNFAVOURABLE to the individual (that is, that causes the individual to be entitled to fewer hours of subsidised care per fortnight), will be applied as far back as the date of event, from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight (even if this is in a previous financial year).

For the purpose of CCS:

the date of notification is the date Centrelink receives the notification regarding a change in an individual's circumstances

the date of event is the date that a change in an individual's circumstances actually occurred

the date of effect is the date that particular information about an individual's circumstances will be taken into account.

Example:

On Saturday 15 July 2023, Victor, a single parent, increased their paid work hours from part time to full time, which increased their entitlement (subsidised hours result) from 72 to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. However, Victor only notified Centrelink of this change on Monday 16 October 2023, around 3 months after it occurred. As such, the increase in Victor's entitlement is only applied from Monday 25 September 2023, which is 28 days before they notified Centrelink of the new information about their circumstances, to the beginning of the CCS fortnight.

Example:

On Monday 16 October 2023, Cecily, a single parent, notified Centrelink that on Saturday 15 July 2023, they decreased their paid work hours from full-time to part-time, which decreases their entitlement (subsidised hours result) from 100 to 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. The decrease in Cecily's entitlement is applied from Monday 17 July 2023, which is the beginning of the CCS fortnight after the change occurred.

Beneficial changes in entitlement (participation related) that are taken into account back more than 28 days

In certain circumstances, if an individual is late in reporting a change in their participation level or circumstances that is beneficial in terms of increasing their entitlement to hours of subsidy per fortnight (subsidised hours result), and the delegate believes in their circumstances they have provided the information as soon as practicable, the delegate can take the information into account back more than 28 days. The delegate can take the information into account as far back as the date the change occurred, but not further back than the beginning of the previous financial year (that is, the review could never extend back more than 2 years).

Circumstances in which the delegate may take beneficial participation information into account back more than 28 days where the individual notified of the change after it occurred could be for reasons such as, but not limited to, the parent, their partner (

1.1.P.30

) or the child experience a natural disaster, domestic violence, serious illness or medical condition including hospitalisation or significant trauma.

Example:

Taylor is a single parent who is working part-time (16 hours per fortnight), which entitles them to 72 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. On Monday 10 July 2023, Taylor begins doing a training program in accounting (for 45 hours per fortnight), which brings their total hours of recognised activity to 61 hours per fortnight, increasing their activity test result to 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight. However, Taylor does not notify Centrelink of this change until Friday 25 August 2023 because there is major flooding in their town that affects their house on Friday 14 July 2023. As a result of the flood, Taylor has not had access to the internet or their home phone, and has not been able to visit a Centrelink office as access to roads have been cut off. Afterwards Taylor contacts Centrelink to explain their circumstances and Centrelink agrees that their new subsidised hours result of 100 hours of subsidised care per fortnight will be applied from Monday 17 July 2023 (the CCS fortnight after the change occurred).

Reviews initiated by affected persons

Generally, a person affected by a decision made by an officer under FA law can apply for a review of the decision. The review will be undertaken by an

ARO

.

The ARO may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision.

Review relating to care percentage decisions - initiated by affected persons

From 1 July 2010, changes to child support and FTB legislation aligned determinations about care between child support and FTB. This means where a care determination needs to be made in respect of a child, the determination can be made by either a delegate of the Child Support Registrar or the Secretary (CSA Act section 54K and FAAct section 35T).

Where either the Registrar or the Secretary conducts an internal review of a care decision, any new decision made on review will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary. Where the

ART

amends a decision or substitutes a new decision about a care percentage, that amended or substituted decision will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary.

Explanation:

Where a care percentage decision has been made by Centrelink, this decision is applied to the child support assessment of the payee and the payer. Both the payee and the payer can approach either Child Support or Centrelink to seek review of the decision.

Where the care percentage decision has no effect under FA law (that is, neither party is claiming FTB) only Child Support may make or review care percentage decisions. In such a case, if the individual approaches Centrelink to apply for the review, Child Support, as the original decision maker must undertake the review.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 109A Review of certain decisions may be initiated by applicant

Time limit for a review initiated by affected persons

Generally, an application for review by a person in relation to FA should be lodged within 52 weeks after the individual is notified of the original decision, noting:

this time limit does not apply to FTB by instalment decisions, and some other decisions

applications for a review in relation to CCS and ACCS, including requirements of approved providers under FA(Admin)Act Part 8A, must be made within 13 weeks after the applicant is notified of the decision.

However, there are time limits for full arrears to be payable depending upon the circumstances. (For more information, refer to

'Date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected individual'

.)

The table below indicates decisions other than instalment decisions where a 52 week time limit may not apply.

If these circumstances apply …

then the time limit to apply for a review is …

special circumstances that prevented the person from making a review application

extended past 52 weeks (or 90 days for CCS and ACCS) to such further period as determined appropriate by Centrelink.

FTB past period decision

the later of the end of the income year after the income year in which the past period occurred or 52 weeks after the original decision was made.

determination of entitlement or no entitlement to FTB by single payment in substitution because of the death of another person

to the end of the income year after the income year in which the death occurred.

decision that relates to a period involving 2 income years (noting limitations associated with CCS and ACCS - see the introduction to this section above or

'Date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected individual'

)

the later of the end of the income year after the income year in which the period ended or 52 weeks after the original decision was made.

decision relating to an assessment of taxable income by the ATO (including FTB by instalment cases) and the individual lodged their income tax return before the end of the income year following the income year to which the assessment relates

there is no time limit.

review of an assessment of taxable income by the ATO and the individual initially lodged their income tax return before the end of the lodgement year

the later of 90 days after the individual receives notification of the review from the ATO or 52 weeks after the original decision was made.

review of child support entitlement

the later of 90 days after the individual receives notification of the review from Child Support or 52 weeks after the original decision was made.

determination of an individual's eligibility or entitlement for CCS or ACCS

90 days after the applicant is notified of the decision.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 108 Decisions that may be reviewed under section 109A, section 109D Review applications—time limits applicable to review of certain decisions, section 109DB Review of entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS—taking account of changes of circumstances etc, section 109DC Review of entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS—time limit on increase, section 109E Date of effect of certain decisions relating to payment of FTB by instalment

Date of effect of a favourable decision for a review initiated by an affected person

Except for CCS and ACCS decisions, provided the person applies for the review within the prescribed timeframe as described above, and the outcome of the review is in their favour, because Centrelink varies or sets the original decision aside, the decision takes effect from the first day of the period to which the original decision relates. This means arrears are payable from that day, giving the decision full effect.

However, for a review decision relating to FTB by instalment, where the application for review is made more than 52 weeks after notice was given of the original decision, or a further period if Centrelink is satisfied there are special circumstances that prevented the applicant from making an application for review on time, then the date of effect is generally the later of:

the date from which full arrears are payable, or

1 July of the income year before the income year in which the application for review is made.

Explanation:

For FTB by instalment cases, full arrears are payable if the application for review is made before the end of the income year following the income year in which the notice of the original decision was given (or an extended period as specified by the Secretary). Otherwise, arrears can only be paid back to the beginning of the income year prior to the income year in which the application for review is made.

This limitation on the date of effect does not apply where the application for review is the result of:

the individual meeting the reconciliation conditions and applying for a review of their annual entitlement (that is, asking for reconciliation to occur)

an assessment or review of taxable income by the ATO, provided the application for review is made within 90 days of when the individual received notification of the ATO decision and the individual had lodged their tax return before the end of the lodgement year, or

a review of child support entitlement, provided the person makes the application for review within 90 days of receiving notification of the revised child support assessment.

CCS & ACCS

In relation to CCS and ACCS decisions the decision takes effect from the date of the previous decision, if that date is not earlier than the beginning of the previous financial year, provided:

the person applies for the review within 90 days of a decision relating to eligibility and entitlements

the outcome of the review is in their favour, and

the individual had provided all the information required for Centrelink to determine their eligibility or entitlement to CCS and ACCS as soon as practicable.

There is no time restriction where the review is the result of the individual meeting the CCS reconciliation conditions or an ATO review.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 105C Review of entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS—taking account of changes of circumstances etc, section 109D Review applications—time limits applicable to review of certain decisions, section 109DB Review of entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS—taking account of changes of circumstances etc, section 109DC Review of entitlement to be paid CCS or ACCS—time limit on increase, section 109E Date of effect of certain decisions relating to payment of FTB by instalment

Further requirement for an application for review relating to an income estimate

An application for review of a decision in regard to eligibility for or entitlement to FA (other than SBP) or a CCS percentage to the extent that the decision was based on an estimate of the person's ATI cannot be made until after the end of the income year, and where the person is required to lodge a tax return, after the ATO has made an assessment of the person's taxable income for that year.

An application for review of a decision in regard to eligibility for or entitlement to FTB to the extent that the decision was based on an estimate of maintenance income for an income year cannot be made until after the end of that income year.

Explanation:

This restriction only allows a review of a decision to the extent that it is based on an income estimate to occur after actual ATI is available so that correct entitlement can be determined. This stops individuals from retrospectively adjusting their income estimates to derive arrears that may later become a debt when actual ATI is known.

This restriction does not preclude the person from providing a revised estimate of income at any time during the income year. If a revised estimate is provided and considered reasonable, the rate paid can be varied from the date the revised estimate is provided.

If an FTB instalment claim is rejected due to the income estimate being too high and the income estimate subsequently decreases, the individual can lodge a new claim containing a revised income estimate and, if eligible, be paid prospectively from the date of the new claim. However, the individual will need to wait until their actual ATI is known before they can be paid for the past period (that is, period from the date the first rejected claim is lodged up to the date the new claim is lodged).

Where a claim for SBP has been rejected because of the income estimate, the individual’s eligibility for each payment can be reviewed if they provide a revised estimate within 52 weeks of being notified of the rejection decision. The revised income estimate must include the individual’s ATI and, if the individual was partnered on the day the claim was initially lodged, the ATI of the person to whom they were partnered on that day. This means that if the individual has separated since lodging the claim, their former partner's ATI for the 6 month income test period needs to be included in the revised income estimate.

4.1.1.60 Exemption from TFN requirements for SIFS

Summary

The Secretary may determine that an individual may remain entitled to

SIFS

, despite failing to provide a

TFN

, if the reason is that the individual cannot obtain this from their previous or current partner.

An individual is generally given 28 days to satisfy the TFN requirements. If an individual fails to provide a TFN statement their claim is taken not to have been made (that is, the claim would be ineffective).

SIFS cannot be paid until the individual provides a TFN statement (

4.1.1.10

).

SIFS cannot be paid to the individual until their partner (and any previous partners) (

1.1.M.50

) provide a TFN statement, or the individual is exempt from providing a TFN statement (

4.1.1.20

).

7.3.2.20 Waiving a debt relating to an offence

Summary

The recovery of debt (

1.1.D.60

) arising from an offence must be waived (

1.1.W.10

) if the debtor has received an extended custodial sentence because they are either unwilling or unable to repay the debt.

The proportion of the debt that arose in connection with the offence must be waived. This may be up to 100% of the debt amount.

Proof of sentencing

Under the FA(Admin)Act section 98, the court must have indicated that:

the custodial sentence is a longer sentence than usual, and

it was imposed because the debtor was unwilling or unable to repay the debt.

Proof that the sentence was imposed or lengthened because the debtor was unable or unwilling to repay the debt should be obtained from the judge's remarks upon sentencing, or from the sentence itself. It is important that the length of the sentence is not compared with other sentences for similar offences when making such a decision, as this is not sufficient to show the reasons the sentence was imposed.

6.4.3.40 Prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Summary

Individuals who receive

FTB

(and/or their partners, if applicable) are prohibited from receiving FTB payments via instalments based on an estimate of income if they have an outstanding non-lodger debt as a result of a non-lodger decision. The period of entitlement to which this applies is called the prohibition period.

Non-lodger decision

If an individual who receives FTB (and/or their partner) is required to lodge an income tax return in respect of an income year (

1.1.I.75

), or notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) but fails to do so, the individual’s entitlement determination may be varied. The effect of a non-lodger decision is that the individual was not entitled to FTB in respect of that income year. A non-lodger debt is then raised for the amount of FTB they received for that year.

A non-lodger decision may be made at any time following the end of the lodgement year (usually around September). Following this decision, a variation of entitlement notice is issued by Centrelink to the individual.

Commencement date of the prohibition period

If an individual has a non-lodger debt as a result of a non-lodger decision, the prohibition of FTB based on an estimate of income can be applied at the end of the grace period. A 75 day grace period for the lodgement of income tax returns, for notification of ATI if the individual and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, or to fully repay a non-lodger debt (or a combination of the above) takes effect following Centrelink’s decision to make a variation of entitlement, at which time the individual will be issued a variation of entitlement notice. The grace period may be a longer period if Centrelink determines that there are special circumstances to vary the length of the grace period.

FTB payments based on an estimate of income may continue during the grace period but would cease at the end of the grace period if there are still outstanding income tax returns, or Centrelink has not been notified of the individual’s ATI if the individual and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, and there is still an outstanding non-lodger debt.

Where an individual has repaid all their non-lodger debt/s, lodged all their relevant income tax returns (or a combination of both), or notified Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, the prohibition will be removed to enable FTB payments based on an estimate of income to re-commence.

FA(Admin)Act

section 28 Variation of instalment and past period entitlement determinations where income tax return not lodged, section 32AA Non-payment of FTB for non-lodgement of tax returns, section 32AB Prohibited periods for claimant, section 32AC Prohibited periods for relevant partner, section 32AD Prohibited periods for new partner

Removal of prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Target individuals

The prohibition of FTB will apply if an individual's rate of FTB is worked out on the basis of an income estimate or indexed income estimate, or an estimate of maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

).

The prohibition of FTB must be applied unless there are special circumstances that make it appropriate to end or defer the prohibition period.

Prohibition affects all components of FTB

Prohibition of FTB based on an estimate will prevent an individual from being paid FTB Part A, including

RA

,

MBA

,

NBS

,

NBU

and

ES

Part A, and FTB Part B including ES Part B, via instalment payments.

Individuals who receive RA as part of their FTB and who also receive income support will be prevented from receiving RA through their income support payments while they are subject to prohibition of FTB. This is because an individual remains entitled to FTB (including RA) although they are prohibited from being paid via instalments during the prohibition period.

In contrast,

SBP

is not an FTB payment, so it is not subject to prohibition of FTB. If an individual is eligible for SBP under either the SBP income test or the FTB Part A eligibility test, SBP would be paid immediately, regardless of whether the individual is subject to prohibition.

Prohibition of FTB will not affect the eligibility of an individual (or their partner, if applicable) for any of the following concessions, rebates or payments unless they lose entitlement to FTB through the operation of FA(Admin)Act section 32AE, non-entitlement to payment of FTB (

1.1.N.31

Verification of lodgement of tax returns

If an individual informs Centrelink that they (and their partner, if applicable) have lodged their relevant tax return, the prohibition of FTB payments will be lifted. However, the individual may be required to provide evidence of lodgement of outstanding tax returns.

Acceptable evidence may include, but is not limited to:

a printed copy of the My Tax lodgement notification

a

TNA

for any of the outstanding financial years

a tax invoice or bill, or letter from the servicing accountant, or

a copy of the cover of the tax return/s lodged.

The above are examples of evidence only and not intended to be inclusive.

Individuals in a shared care situation

Prohibition of FTB will apply to an individual (and/or their partner, if applicable) who receives less than 100% of the FTB for a child due to shared care of that child. The other carer who receives the remaining amount of FTB will not be subject to prohibition of their FTB, unless they, or their partner, are also subject to a prohibited period because they have an outstanding non-lodger debt due to not lodging their relevant tax returns or failing to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return.

Example:

Greg and Jill have a son Avi, for whom they have been receiving FTB by fortnightly instalments in the 2022-23 income year. Greg and Jill separate in April 2024 and share care for Avi on a 50/50 basis. Jill lodges her tax return for the 2022-23 income year, however Greg does not lodge a tax return for that year by 30 June 2024. After 1 July 2024, Centrelink makes a decision that Greg is not entitled to FTB for the 2022-23 income year because he has not lodged his tax return and a non-lodger debt is raised. Greg still has not lodged his tax return or fully repaid the non-lodger debt at the end of the 75 day grace period and is prohibited from being paid FTB.

However, Jill could still be paid FTB by instalments based on her FTB shared care percentage of 50% for Avi, because she has lodged her relevant tax return.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 32AD Prohibited periods for new partner, section 32AB Prohibited periods for claimant, section 32AC Prohibited periods for relevant partner, section 32AA Non-payment of FTB for non-lodgement of tax returns

Separated couples

If a prohibition of FTB has been applied to an individual and their partner due to the partner's outstanding income tax lodgement, and the couple subsequently separates, the prohibition will no longer apply to the individual. However, if the couple later reconcile and the partner has still not lodged the relevant tax returns or fully repaid the non-lodger debt, the prohibition of FTB will recommence.

Example:

Agnes and Denzel are members of a couple. Denzel is paid FTB by instalments for the children for the 2021-22 income year. Agnes does not lodge her income tax return for the 2021-22 income year by 30 June 2023, and after 1 July 2023 Denzel's entitlement determination is varied so that he is not entitled to FTB for the 2021-22 income year due to his partner's non-lodgement. A non-lodger debt is raised for the entire amount of FTB he received for the 2021-22 income year. Denzel's partner Agnes does not lodge her income tax return and Denzel has not fully repaid the non-lodger debt by the end of the 75 day grace period. From the end of the grace period Denzel is prohibited from receiving FTB via instalments.

In April 2024, Agnes and Denzel separate, and share the care of their children. As a result of this separation, Denzel's non-lodger debt will be written-off and the prohibition will be lifted for Denzel. However, if Agnes and Denzel reconcile, the non-lodger debt will be reactivated and Denzel will again be prohibited from receiving FTB if Agnes has still not lodged her income tax return in respect of the 2021-22 income year, or the non-lodger debt for 2021-22 is not fully repaid.

Reconciliation - ex-partners

Blended families

If an individual in a blended family (

1.1.B.30

) is subject to prohibition of FTB, their current partner will also be prohibited from receiving FTB while they remain a couple, even if the partner is separately receiving FTB for children from a previous relationship.

If an individual who is subject to prohibition of FTB becomes a member of a couple during an income year, their new partner will also be prohibited from receiving FTB based on an estimate of income and/or for the past-period in that income year. This applies regardless of whether the new partner also receives FTB instalments for children of a previous relationship.

Example:

Carl and Dom have 2 FTB children, Tom and Anna. Carl claims FTB for Tom, a child from Carl's previous relationship and Dom claims FTB for Anna, a child of Dom's previous relationship. Carl does not lodge his tax return as required, which results in a non-lodger debt. As a result Carl's FTB will be prohibited. Whilst they are partnered Dom will also be prohibited from receiving FTB until Carl lodges the requisite tax return, or fully pays the non-lodger debt.

Carl and Dom separate and Carl subsequently partners with Jen, who also has a child from a previous relationship. Jen will also be prohibited from receiving FTB, even if Jen has no outstanding income tax returns, until Carl lodges the required income tax return, or fully repays the non-lodger debt. Dom is no longer subject to a prohibited period as he is not Carl's current partner and has met all lodgement requirements.

Debt recovery

Individuals who are subject to prohibition of FTB will continue to be subject to any existing debt recovery action for their FTB non-lodger debts or any other FTB debt. However, mandatory withholdings will cease for as long as FTB payments are prohibited. Other methods may be used to recover any outstanding FTB debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 82 Methods of recovery, section 84 Deductions from debtor's FTB

Obligations of prohibited individuals

While subject to FTB prohibition, individuals are obligated to continue to update their (and/or their partner's, if applicable) income and circumstances. This may include, but is not limited to:

inclusion in the automatic uplift process

inclusion in the new financial year assessment (NFYA) process, and

child reviews.

Prohibited individuals will also be required to lodge tax returns, or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, for income years in which they were prohibited. This includes years during which they were prohibited from receiving FTB for the entire income year.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 7 How to claim, section 14 Restriction on determining claim where income tax assessment not made

Application of section 32AE - loss of entitlement to FTB

Loss of entitlement will occur when an individual has 3 or more variations under FA(Admin)Act subsection 28(2) due to not meeting the reconciliation conditions within the required timeframes and at least one of those variations results in a debt raised under section 71. Only variations for which the relevant reconciliation conditions are not met and/or an outstanding debt as at 1 July 2010 onwards will apply for the purposes of determining non-entitlement to FTB.

Loss of entitlement to FTB may preclude the individual (and/or their partner, if applicable) from access to the FTB Part A ancillary benefits, such as the lower threshold of the Extended Medicare Safety Net from the start of the following calendar year, Child Dental Benefits Schedule or a

HCC

(FTB).

Loss of entitlement to FTB may also preclude the individual (and/or their partner, if applicable) from eligibility to SBP under the FTB Part A eligibility test where the 6 month SBP income test is not met.

Individuals who are not entitled to FTB based on an estimate will be able to make a claim for payment of FTB for a past period in a previous income year, and payment can be made following reconciliation based on actual ATI for an individual and/or their partner (if applicable) for that particular income year. A new claim for payment of FTB based on an estimate of income will only be accepted once all outstanding income tax returns in respect of those income years have been lodged, or the individual notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, or all outstanding non-lodger debts are fully repaid (or a combination of the above).

Note

From 1 July 2008 the term 'non-resident parent' has been replaced with the term 'payer' (

1.1.P.72

).

Definition

The term non-resident parent was used to refer to a parent who was required to pay child support to the resident parent (

1.1.R.40

) of a child. The non-resident parent must be the child's natural or adoptive parent.

Before the Family Law Reform changes in 1996, a non-resident parent was known as the 'non-custodial parent' (

Part A, the base rate for Method 1, is the maximum rate of FTB Part A worked out using Method 2.

From 1 July 2016, the FTB Part A supplement is not included in Method 2 calculation where the combined

ATI

is less than or equal to $80,000.

From 20 March 2017,

ES

ceased for new FTB recipients. For individuals who became new recipients of FTB after 20 September 2016, they will no longer be paid ES after 19 March 2017. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. Therefore, ES will only be included in Method 2 calculations for grandfathered individuals. See

3.1.4.30 Rent assistance

Summary

RA

is included in calculating the maximum rate of

FTB

Part A when the rate is worked out using Method 1 or Method 3. Method 3 applies when an individual has a regular care child and no FTB children. RA recognises the housing costs that low income families face in the private (that is, non-government) rental market.

This topic includes information about:

RA eligibility requirements

RA child

current maximum RA rates and RA rent threshold amounts

how to calculate the gross rate of RA

shared care of RA child

RA for regular care children - Method 3

payment of RA while individual is overseas

verification of the amount of rent paid, and

duplicate RA payments.

The assessment of eligibility and rate of RA for FTB is contained in the FAAct. However, the meaning of rent and the associated concepts are the same as under the SSAct.

Policy reference:

SS Guide

1.1.R.160

Rent (RA)

RA eligibility requirements

The individual who claims RA:

must have at least one RA child

cannot be an ineligible homeowner (SS Guide

1.1.I.140

)

cannot be an aged care resident in a Commonwealth funded bed in a nursing home or hostel (SS Guide

1.1.A.110

), and

must pay, or be liable to pay rent, other than Government rent, that is more than the rent threshold (SS Guide

1.1.R.190

).

Note:

Rent paid by an individual's partner is treated as rent paid by the individual.

RA is included in an individual's maximum FTB Part A for Method 1 rate if the:

individual is receiving FTB Part A through fortnightly payments

individual is entitled to FTB Part A for a past period in the previous financial year or during the year in which the claim is made but the individual is not eligible for FTB at the time the past period claim is made, or

individual is entitled to FTB Part A for a past period in the previous financial year or during the year in which the claim is made and is eligible for FTB at the time the past period claim is made, and

individual's past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) is accompanied by an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

), unless the individual cannot lodge an effective instalment claim at that time because the individual

is already receiving FTB fortnightly payments

had previously lodged an instalment claim which has not yet been determined, or

is not eligible for FTB by instalments at the time of the claim.

Example:

Michele lodges a past period claim for the 2022–23 financial year on 6 October 2023, but does not need to lodge an effective instalment claim as she is not eligible for FTB by instalments as her son left her care on 10 September 2023.

) if the FTB child rate for the child is more than the base FTB child rate (

1.1.B.10

), or would be if the rate was not adjusted according to shared care.

A regular care child is an RA child of the individual if:

the child is under 16 years, or

the child has turned 16 years of age and is a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

), and

the child is not an absent overseas regular care child.

Current maximum RA rates

The rate of RA depends on the individual's circumstances. Rates of assistance vary according to family type, rent paid and whether the individual is a relevant shared carer. A relevant shared carer is an individual who has a shared care percentage for each of their FTB children. The relevant shared carer may also have one or more regular care children.

Current RA rent thresholds

Individuals who receive FTB must pay a minimum amount of rent before they become eligible for RA. This minimum amount is the rent threshold, and varies depending on the individual's circumstances.

The following table shows the current annual rent thresholds for RA for individuals who are NOT relevant shared carers.

How to calculate the gross rate of RA

RA is payable with FTB only when the rate is calculated under Method 1 or Method 3. In either case, a (gross) amount of RA is worked out based on the individual's circumstances but the amount paid may be reduced due to an income test. If the rate is calculated under Method 1, the gross RA is added to other components of FTB and the resultant maximum rate may then be reduced due to income or maintenance income. If payments are reduced because of income or maintenance, the reduction will affect both the RA and other components in excess of the base rate. If the rate is calculated under Method 3, the gross RA amount may be reduced under the ordinary income test but there is no maintenance income test.

The gross rate of RA, before any reduction due to income or maintenance, is worked out using the following formula:

Gross RA = (annual rent - rent threshold) × 3/4

provided the result is not greater than the maximum rate for the relevant circumstances.

Annual rent is the amount the individual and/or partner pays for the person's principal home, and the rent threshold is the minimum rent a person must pay to qualify for RA. The rent threshold and maximum rates vary according to the individual's circumstances including whether they are a relevant shared carer.

If the individual has only a regular care child (in care for between 14% and less than 35% of the time) or has a shared care percentage (35% to 65% of the time) for each of their FTB children the gross RA amount is first worked out using the maximum rates and rent thresholds for individuals who are not relevant shared carers, and then using the maximum rates and rent thresholds for a relevant shared carer. The individual is entitled to the higher of the 2 amounts. The maximum rates and rent thresholds specified for relevant shared carers are comparable to those applying to a person claiming RA with a social security payment. This rule is intended to ensure that a person paying low rent is not disadvantaged when they accept responsibility for the shared care of a child.

Individual shares the care of RA children

An individual who shares the care of all of their FTB children is known as a 'relevant shared carer'. An individual must have at least 35% care of an eligible child to be considered a relevant shared carer. RA for a relevant shared carer is first worked out using the maximum rates and rent thresholds for individuals who are not relevant shared carers, and then using the maximum rates and rent thresholds for a relevant shared carer. The individual is entitled to the higher of the 2 amounts.

Explanation:

As the RA threshold with children is higher than the threshold without children, this provision prevents the small number of individuals who pay low rent and who care for a child from being disadvantaged by ensuring they are paid the higher rate of RA.

Example:

Simon pays private rent for his accommodation. Simon and Natalie are divorced and have 2 children, Joshua aged 13 and Susan aged 16. Both children have been living in the full-time care of Natalie, but Joshua now wishes to live some of the time with Simon. Simon and Natalie agree to share the care of Joshua 50%/50%. Simon is granted FTB. Because Simon is paying rent, a comparison will be made between the

FA

RA rate and the applicable FA shared care RA rate and Simon will be paid the higher of the 2 rates.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 38D Rate of RA payable to individual who has at least one FTB child and who is not a relevant shared carer, Schedule 1 clause 38E Rate of RA payable to individual who is a relevant shared carer or who has only one or more regular care children

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.1.30

Shared care rate for FTB,

3.1.4.10

Method 1 - calculating the maximum rate of FTB Part A,

3.1.3

Apportioning income test reductions between FTB Part A components

RA for regular care children - Method 3

A child can only be an FTB child of an individual if the individual has at least 35% care of that child. A child is regarded as a regular care child of an individual who provides care for between 14% and less than 35% of the time. A regular care child is an RA child, and is taken into account in working out the maximum rate of RA.

Individuals who only have one or more regular care children are entitled to the same gross rate of RA as those classified as relevant shared carers. Their RA is calculated under Method 3 as their FTB consists only of RA. The FTB may be reduced due to income if neither the individual nor a partner receives an income support payment and the family's income is above the FTB Part A income free area. The income test applied under Method 3 is the same as for Method 1, but there is no maintenance income test and no comparison with a base rate (the base rate would be zero).

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 28A Method of calculating Part A rate

Payment of RA while individual is overseas

An individual may be able to continue to receive FTB Part A at more than the base FTB child rate during a temporary absence from Australia (

1.1.A.10

). If the individual was renting before their departure and continues to pay rent for the same accommodation during their absence, RA is still payable providing the individual is still eligible to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A during their absence or in the case of individuals who only have one or more regular care children, where the individual or the child are not absent overseas.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.2.40

FTB portability

Verification of the amount of rent paid

The amount of rent paid by the individual must be verified before RA can be paid. Generally, this can be verified using:

a current 'lease' or written tenancy agreement, or

a rent verification document as determined by Services Australia.

See SS Guide

2.2.13.20

for more information about verifying the amount of rent paid by an individual.

Duplicate RA payments

Duplicate RA payments can occur when an individual or their partner:

receives arrears of FTB Part A that includes an amount of RA for a period where RA had already been paid with a social security or veterans' entitlement payment, or

is incorrectly paid RA with both their ongoing FA and social security or veterans' entitlement payments.

This means that the individual receives double the RA to which they were otherwise entitled.

Any RA paid as part of a social security or veterans' entitlements payment in respect of a particular day is taken into account in calculating an individual's entitlement to arrears of FTB Part A (including RA arrears) in respect to that day.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 38J Offsetting for duplicate RA under family assistance and social security law, Schedule 1 clause 38K Offsetting for duplicate RA under family assistance and veterans' entitlements law

4.4.8 Review of FTB entitlements

Introduction

To ensure an individual receives the correct rate of

FTB

by instalment, an automated review of their entitlements (

1.1.E.30

) must be conducted just before an FTB child turns 16 or 18 years of age and prior to the expected end date of their course if they are a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

).

Note:

The below reviews apply to FTB Part B where the individual is a single parent, grandparent or great-grandparent. The rate of FTB Part B is nil for individuals who are not in these categories once their youngest child turns 13 years of age.

FTB child turning 16 years of age

In order to be entitled to FTB, a child 16 years or older must be participating in full-time senior secondary study.

Before the child's 16th birthday, the individual is sent a letter informing them of the date their child is expected to complete secondary study. The letter tells the individual that, if this information is incorrect or ceases to be correct, they must update their child's education details. No action is required from the individual, if the information in the letter is correct.

FTB child turning 18 years of age

If the individual is receiving child support for the child and the child will continue in full-time secondary study after their 18th birthday, the individual will need to take action to extend their child support assessment until the end of the school year, otherwise they may fail the

MAT

for the child which would reduce their rate of FTB Part A payment.

If the child support case was initiated as an agreement, signatures of both the payer and payee are required to extend the child support case past the child's 18th birthday. If one party refuses to extend the case, the party that attempted to extend the case has taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will not be reduced to the base rate. However, in most cases if the payee does not take steps to extend the child support case (obtain maintenance) the payee is deemed to have not taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will be reduced.

In the case where action could result in the payer swapping to be payee, the payer does not have to take maintenance action for FTB purposes.

Where it would disadvantage one party to extend the agreement it may be appropriate that the refusing party not fail the MAT.

Explanation:

If extending the agreement would result in an individual who now has more than 65% care of the children being maintained as a payer, they will not fail the MAT if they refuse to extend. Similarly, if extending the agreement would result in an individual who now has no care of the children being maintained as a payee, they will not fail the MAT if they refuse to extend. Parents with an agreement that modifies a pre-existing child support assessment do not need the consent of the other parent to obtain an extension of the child support assessment.

If the parent does not apply to extend the assessment before the child's 18th birthday, the individual has not taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will be limited to base rate.

For single parents, grandparents and great-grandparent carers, if the child is the individual's youngest FTB child, and is a senior secondary school child, FTB Part B ceases to be paid at the end of the calendar year in which the child turns 18. For couple families (that are not grandparent or great-grandparent carers), FTB Part B ceases to be paid once the youngest child turns 13.

In some circumstances, it is possible the FTB child may be eligible for an amount of

YA

greater than the individual's FTB Part A entitlement for that child.

Explanation:

The individual is provided with information prior to each FTB child in their care turning 18 to ensure the individual and child have enough information to make an informed decision about claiming YA or a prescribed educational scheme (

1.1.P.100

) payment. An individual's FTB entitlement will be cancelled if their FTB child is granted payment of YA, a prescribed educational scheme payment, or payment under a

LMP

.

FTB child completing full-time secondary study

An FTB child's completion of full-time secondary study affects their FTB child eligibility, as they are no longer a senior secondary school child. Prior to the child's expected course end date, the individual will be sent a letter informing them of the date their child is expected to complete secondary study. The individual does not need to do anything if the information is correct. The individual must update their child's education details if the child will remain in study or not complete their course.

Note:

When a child has turned 19 and the calendar year in which the child turned 19 has ended, the FTB Part A rate payable for the child may also be affected, as the child will no longer be a senior secondary school child.

1.1.S.05 Salary sacrificing (CCS)

Definition

Salary sacrificing is an arrangement between an employer and an employee where the employee agrees to forgo part of their future entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) to salary or wages in return for a benefit of a similar value, for example the provision of child care.

Employers may allow employees to salary sacrifice the cost of child care services. If the employer is liable for all or part of the child's child care fees, there is no

CCS

or

ACCS

payable for the part of the fees for which the employer is liable. CCS and ACCS are only payable in respect of the fees that individuals (

1.1.I.90

) are genuinely liable to pay.

The employer may be liable to pay

FBT

on the reportable fringe benefits provided. This is an area of legislation administered by the

ATO

.

Salary sacrificing is not a prescribed third-party payment or discount (

1.1.T.52

).

2.1.1.110 Death of an FTB or regular care child

Summary

This topic provides information about bereavement assistance for an individual when an

FTB

or regular care child dies. The topic covers the following issues:

eligibility continues for 14 weeks when FTB child dies

where the individual has been charged with murder or manslaughter

accepting notice of death for an individual who received instalments

accepting notice of death for a past period claim

shared care of FTB child, and

calculating FTB bereavement amount.

An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) is not eligible to receive a bereavement payment if an FTB child in the care of the ACO dies.

Eligibility continues for 14 weeks when FTB child dies

If an individual is eligible for FTB for a child, and the child dies, they remain eligible for FTB for that child for a 14-week period beginning on the day the child died. This is known as the bereavement period.

If an individual receives FTB by instalments, they can choose to be paid either a lump sum or ongoing instalments for 14 weeks after the child died. This also applies to an individual receiving the

RA

component of FTB by instalments for a regular care child. If an individual claims FTB for a past period, they will receive a lump sum. If the individual was entitled to the lower rate of NBS for the child who died and the child died before their first birthday, they are entitled to the higher rate of

NBS

(subject to the income test) for that child and can be paid a top-up amount of NBS.

Where the individual is charged with murder or manslaughter

Where the individual has been charged with murder or manslaughter of the deceased FTB child/ren, Centrelink may direct the FTB bereavement payments to a payment nominee. Centrelink must obtain written consent from the person being appointed as a nominee (

4.1.3

). While Centrelink must consider the wishes of the individual in deciding whether to appoint a payment nominee (other than in relation to a security notice), the wishes of the individual are not the only factor that is considered, and Centrelink may still appoint a payment nominee irrespective of the individual’s wishes if considered appropriate in the circumstances.

If the individual is subsequently convicted, the bereavement payment received by the payment nominee may be raised as a debt to the Commonwealth. Specific advice should be sought from

DSS

if this is being considered.

If all or some of the bereavement period has already been paid or was paid to the individual before they were charged, and the individual is subsequently convicted, the bereavement payment received is a recoverable debt to the Commonwealth.

In all instances, Centrelink must make the usual considerations in relation to whether a debt should be recovered, waived, or written off, taking into account the applicable circumstances.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 71 Debts in respect of family assistance other than CCS, ACCS and FTB advance, section 101 Waiver in special circumstances, section 219TB Appointment of payment nominee, section 219TD Provisions relating to appointments, section 219TE Suspension and cancellation of nominee appointments

Accepting notice of death - individual claims FTB by instalments

Notification that an FTB child has died can be accepted from the individual receiving FTB, a family member or close friend. The following details must be obtained before action is taken to reassess the individual's FTB entitlement:

full name and address and contact number of the person notifying the death

full name and address of the individual receiving FTB

full name,

DOB

and date of death of the FTB child, and

name of the funeral director or hospital.

The funeral director or hospital should be contacted by phone to confirm the details. Centrelink must be certain of the information before taking action.

Accepting notice of death - individual claims for a past period

An individual making a past period claim is not required to provide evidence of the child's death when lodging the claim. However, they should keep a copy of any documents relating to the death with their copy of the claim.

Shared care of FTB child

Where the care of the FTB child was shared and a determination under FAAct section 59 was in place for the child, the amount of the bereavement payment is worked out according to the percentage of FTB for which each individual was eligible.

Each individual is paid the bereavement amount according to their own circumstances.

Calculating FTB bereavement amount

The amount of FTB paid as a lump sum or as ongoing instalments for 14 weeks following the death of the child is calculated on the assumption that the child did not die, and would have remained an FTB child during the bereavement period. The period of payment does not include any day on which the child would have been aged 16 and over if they were not a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

). The amount of FTB paid during the bereavement period can be affected by the

MAT

and maintenance income test which apply during the bereavement period where a relevant period exists (

3.1.7.15

).

3.2.8.10 Initial estimate when making a claim

Summary

This topic includes the following information:

when an income estimate can be used to assess eligibility or entitlement (

1.1.E.30

)

assessing a reasonable estimate

fluctuating income (

1.1.I.20

)

mandatory continuous adjustment

situations where the individual may be better off waiting to claim

FTB

or

1.1.R.10

) of income for

accepting or refusing that an estimate is reasonable.

When an income estimate can be used to assess eligibility or entitlement

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) may need to estimate their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for part or all of the relevant income year depending on the type of claim they make. The following table shows when an estimate can be used to assess eligibility for FTB or SBP or entitlement for CCS.

If the claim is …

the individual …

an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

) for FTB

and their partner (

1.1.P.30

) must estimate their income for the current year.

a past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) for FTB for the current income year

and their partner must estimate their income for the current year.

a past period claim for FTB for a previous income year

and their partner must have their taxable income (

1.1.T.20

) assessed by the

ATO

if they were required to lodge a tax return, or must notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they are not required to lodge a tax return.

Explanation:

A past period claim for a previous income year cannot be determined if the individual and/or their partner has not lodged a tax return or, if they are not required to lodge a tax return, notified Centrelink of their ATI, by 30 June of the income year after the income year to which the claim relates.

a claim for SBP

and their partner on the day the claim is made must estimate their ATI received, or to be received for the relevant 6-month period beginning on the day of the of the stillborn child's delivery. If the individual does not have a partner on the day the claim is made, only the individual's ATI needs to be included in the estimate. This applies regardless of whether the claim is lodged during the 6-month income test period or following the 6-month income test period. The 6-month income test period can cross over 2 income years (see Assessing a reasonable estimate).

Explanation:

An estimate of ATI for the purposes of the SBP income test for a 6-month period is not necessarily confined to a particular income year and is not subject to end of year reconciliation. As such, the status of the income used for the SBP income test remains an estimate.

Note:

If an individual is not eligible for SBP under the SBP income test, they may be eligible for SBP if they are eligible for FTB for another child (claimed either as instalments or as a past-period claim or as a bereavement claim (

1.1.B.20

) for a deceased FTB or regular care child) for a day within 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery, and the individual's rate of FTB included an FTB Part A rate greater than nil for that day.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.12

SBP eligibility

a claim for CCS

must provide an estimate of their and, if applicable, their partner's current year ATI.

Note:

From the 2018-19 year onward, past period claims will not be able to be made for CCS payments. That is, the CCS (and

ACCS

if applicable) must be claimed throughout the year.

For information when an estimate can be used for an FTB bereavement claim see

4.2.2.30

.

Note:

For the purposes of the SBP income test, once an estimate of income provided with a claim is accepted as reasonable, the claim is determined as either entitled or not entitled.

If entitled, the estimate is not re-visited and the individual maintains their eligibility even where their income has subsequently risen during the 6-month income test period.

If the individual is determined as not entitled because the individual's ATI is too high and subsequently their income estimate decreases, the individual may become eligible for SBP. The individual can either submit a new claim to reflect the changed circumstances, or seek a review of the determination relating to the original claim and provide the revised estimate as part of the review process. If the individual chooses to lodge a new claim this must be done no later than 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery. If the individual chooses to seek a review of the no entitlement determination of their claim, they must do so within 52 weeks of being notified of the no entitlement determination. Where an individual has separated since lodging the claim, their partner's income will be included unless they make a new claim at a date after the separation but by no later than 52 weeks beginning on the day of the stillborn child's delivery.

FAAct

section 36 When an individual is eligible for SBP in normal circumstances

Assessing a reasonable estimate

When deciding if an estimate of ATI is reasonable, Centrelink considers whether the individual:

has provided all applicable sources of taxable income

Example:

Gross wages or salary including overtime and shift allowances, taxable and tax free pensions or benefits, taxable income from self-employment, taxable compensation payments, rental income, dividends, distributions interest received or net investment income.

has included any other sources of income

Example:

Target foreign income (

1.1.T.05

), reportable superannuation contributions (

1.1.R.35

), or adjusted fringe benefits total.

included amounts for total net investment losses or

DCME

where appropriate.

Centrelink must ensure the individual has provided a total estimate of their ATI and the calculations are correct. If errors or omissions are identified by Centrelink, they should be discussed with the individual. The individual must agree to make any alterations to the estimate.

The estimate must be considered reasonable taking into account the individual's financial circumstances for the income year to date, together with any anticipated variations to their income for the rest of the year.

Note:

For the SBP income test, the individual needs to take into account their financial circumstances in the relevant 6-month income test period beginning on the day of the child's delivery. See

4.15.1

for further details.

Fluctuating income

In some cases, it can be difficult for an individual to estimate their and/or their partner's ATI.

Example:

If the individual and/or their partner are casual employees, are working a lot of overtime, or are self-employed.

Centrelink can assist the individual in calculating their expected income taking into account the individual's present circumstances and any changes that may occur. An allowance can be made for possible increases of income if the individual is unsure. There is no particular method that must be used to work out the estimate.

Example:

Miriam's gross annual salary is normally $68,000. By September she has earned another $1,500 in overtime. Her employer has told her that overtime will continue, but not at the same rate. Miriam thinks that it's likely that she will get half as much overtime each month for the remaining 9 months of the financial year ($250 per month). She is also hoping to receive a bonus of around $5,000 before the end of the financial year. Miriam's estimate is worked out as follows:

Income details

Estimated amount ($)

Gross salary

68,000

Bonus

5,000

Overtime July - September

1,500

Overtime October - June

2,250

TOTAL

76,750

Miriam claims FTB and is paid instalments based on this estimate. As it turns out, Miriam never receives the bonus she was expecting. Her actual income is assessed as $71,750. After her estimate is reconciled against her actual income she is paid a top-up of FTB for the difference in her payment rate.

Example:

Brian's gross weekly wage is $1,100. He works irregular overtime, however the amount he is paid can be substantial. Brian does not know how much overtime he will get for the current financial year. He has been working in the same job for the last 3 years and often worked overtime. Over the last 3 years his wage has increased, but his overtime has been an average of about 20% for each year. Brian's estimate is worked out as follows:

Income details

Estimated amount ($)

Gross wages

57,200

Overtime

11,440

TOTAL

68,640

Mandatory continuous adjustment

Individuals who receive FTB by instalment and advise of a change in their estimated ATI, have their estimated annual maintenance income recalculated, or have their estimate automatically uplifted by Centrelink, may have their FTB rate automatically adjusted if required, to reduce the risk of an overpayment at the end of the income year.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 31E Continuous adjustment of daily rate of FTB

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.3.1.30

Mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB instalments

Situations where a past period claim for FTB may be preferable to instalments

There are some situations where it may be difficult for an individual to accurately estimate their and/or their partner's ATI because the effect of a financial change is too complex to estimate. If this is the case, the individual should consider claiming FTB as a lump-sum for the past period.

Explanation:

Estimating an individual's, or their partner's, income may be difficult if they expect to receive one of the following types of payment:

eligible termination payment

capital gains

reportable fringe benefits

inheritance from a deceased estate

surrender of a life insurance policy

lump sum compensation payment

earnings paid for a previous financial year, or

lump sum interest payment.

Note 1:

Individuals may also elect to receive part or none of their payment (for example, base rate for FTB) by instalment or fee reduction and then receive any top-ups after their payments are reconciled and their actual ATI is known.

Note 2:

Individuals cannot elect to claim CCS for a past period. All individuals will be asked to estimate their and their partner's, ATI at claim.

Situations where a past period claim for SBP may be preferable

There are also situations where an individual may be unable to estimate their and/or their partner's ATI during the 6-month SBP income test period. This may be particularly the case if there are fluctuations in income resulting from the time taken off work to recover from the stillbirth or other complex financial circumstances, such as the receipt of irregular income or lump sum payments. If this is the case, the individual may wish to claim SBP after the 6-month income test period when they have a greater degree of certainty about their likely income during the 6-month income test period.

Individuals have 52 weeks beginning on the day of a stillborn child's delivery to claim SBP. SBP is paid as a single lump sum, whether or not the payment is claimed in the 6-month income test period or afterward (

4.15.1

).

For the purposes of the SBP income test, taxable lump sum payments received by an individual in the relevant 6-month income test period are to be included as income for the income test. The proportion of the lump sum payment that is taken into account will depend on the length of the period to which the payment relates, or whether the payment relates to a period.

Examples:

If the payment relates to earnings over a 6-month period or less, 100% of the payment is to be included.

If the payment relates to earnings over a period between 6 and 12 months the appropriate proportion between 50 and 100% of the payment is to be included (that is, if the payment relates to earnings over a 9-month period, 67% of the payment is to be included).

Where the individual can demonstrate that an amount less than 50% of their taxable lump sum payment should be attributed to the 6-month period because the payment received relates to a period of work longer than 12 months, a smaller proportion may be included.

If the payment relates to an unearned lump sum that does not relate to a specific period, 50% of the payment is to be included (such as a payment from a family trust).

Note:

For tax purposes, capital gains are regarded as having been received on the date of the event rather than when the payment is made.

Explanation:

For tax purposes, a capital gain event takes place on the day contracts are exchanged for the sale of an investment property, not the date that settlement occurs on that property. The event is the date that payment is regarded as having been received for tax purposes so the capital gain from the event must be included as income for the purpose of the SBP income test if the event took place during the relevant 6-month income test period, even if the proceeds from the sale were received outside that period.

Accuracy of the estimate for FTB & CCS purposes

For those individuals who are required to lodge tax returns with the ATO, their estimated ATI amount for a financial year is reconciled against their actual ATI for that year once the ATO has made an assessment of their taxable income. The following table shows the effect on FTB or CCS entitlement once income has been reconciled.

If the estimated ATI is …

then the effect on entitlement is generally a …

Accuracy of the estimate for SBP purposes

For the purpose of the SBP income test, the individual's estimated ATI is not reconciled against actual ATI. As the estimate relates to a 6-month period, rather than a full income year, the individual is required to give a 'best effort' estimate of the ATI that will be, or was received by them and/or their partner during the 6-month income test period.

Accepting the estimate

For the purposes of FTB and CCS, generally the individual's estimated ATI should be accepted as reasonable, if all their known sources of income are included, and the calculations are correct.

However, if it is clear that the estimate does not reflect the individual's financial circumstances, it must be discussed with the individual and the individual should be given the opportunity to change their estimate if they decide to do so.

Accepting an estimate which is obviously too low may lead to a debt once the individual's ATI is reconciled. Recovery of the debt may place the individual in a difficult financial position in the future.

For the purposes of SBP, the individual's estimate is also accepted as reasonable if all known sources of income are included and their calculations are correct. However, as the estimated ATI is not reconciled against actual income, it is important to ensure the individual has submitted a 'best efforts' estimate that accurately reflects their circumstances.

Accepting an estimate of income that is too low from an individual for SBP could lead to incorrect payment. Once the estimate is accepted, the estimate will not be subject to revision, unless there is evidence of fraud or misleading information in the provision of the estimate - that is, the individual is considered to have made their best efforts to provide an accurate estimate and are considered eligible on that basis if their estimated income for the 6-month income test period is less than or equal to the relevant income limit.

It is also important for the purposes of the SBP income test that caution is exercised before accepting an estimate that appears too high, unless the individual insists on lodging the claim with that estimate. Accepting an estimate that is too high could lead to an eligible individual being ruled ineligible for SBP. This could arise in circumstances where, for example, the individual overestimated the amount they should include from a lump sum payment or their estimated adjusted fringe benefits total.

The following table shows whether an estimate should be considered to be reasonable.

If the estimate appears to be …

and relates to a claim for …

then it is considered to be …

too high

FTB

reasonable.

It is acceptable to allow the individual to over-estimate their ATI if they want to avoid or reduce a possible debt later. However, it should be explained to the individual how this may affect their entitlement to other benefits.

too high

SBP

reasonable - exercise caution.

Although it is acceptable to allow the individual to over-estimate their ATI, this could mean that the individual misses out on a payment to which they would otherwise be entitled. The income information in the claim should be carefully examined before accepting the estimate.

Example:

An individual could mistakenly include too much of a lump sum payment received during the 6-month income test period.

too high

CCS

reasonable.

It is acceptable to allow individuals to over-estimate their ATI where an individual's ATI fluctuates making it difficult to provide an accurate estimate. These individuals may choose to provide an estimate at the upper end of an estimated income range, in order to avoid possible overpayments. However, it should be explained to the individual how this may affect the entitlements including having a lower CCS percentage.

significantly low

FTB or CCS

not reasonable.

Note:

The individual may want to deliberately underestimate their ATI to gain access in the short term to a higher rate of FTB, RA, a HCC or higher child care fee reductions.

significantly low

SBP

not reasonable.

The individual may be underestimating their ATI deliberately to gain access to SBP when their income would otherwise mean they are ineligible. As the estimated ATI is not reconciled against actual ATI, it is important to ensure the individual has submitted a best efforts estimate that accurately reflects their circumstances. An estimate that appears too low on the basis of the available evidence should be rejected.

Estimate not reasonable

In all circumstances for FTB, CCS and SBP, if the individual has clearly underestimated their ATI (taking into account their financial circumstances) and they do not wish to change the estimate, the estimate is not considered to be reasonable.

The claim must be determined on the basis that there is no fortnightly entitlement to FTB, or eligibility for SBP, or CCS by fee reduction at more than the zero rate, as the case may be. An individual may be eligible to claim FTB as a lump sum after the end of the financial year when their actual ATI is known. In regard to CCS, at reconciliation, if the individual's actual ATI is below the upper income threshold and therefore their CCS percentage for the financial year is above zero, they may have a CCS entitlement and any outstanding amounts owed to the individual will be paid directly to them as a lump sum.

1.1.L.25 Legislative rate for FTB/CCS

Definition

The legislative rate of

FTB

/

CCS

is the rate of FTB/CCS payable to an individual (

1.1.I.90

) under the

FA

legislation.

6 November 2023
================================================================================
SOURCE URL: https://guides.dss.gov.au/family-assistance-guide/1/2/6
================================================================================
1.2.6 Child care subsidy (CCS) - description

Objectives of

CCS

CCS aims to:

assist families with the cost of early childhood education and care

facilitate individuals (

1.1.I.90

) to participate, or increase their participation, in the workforce

facilitate children's attendance in child care to support their early learning and development.

CCS eligibility

Individuals' eligibility for CCS is determined in relation to each session of care (

1.1.S.40

) delivered by an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

). An individual is eligible for CCS for a session of care provided by an approved child care service to a child if, at the time the session is provided:

the child is an

FTB

or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) of the individual or their partner (

1.1.P.30

)

the child is 13 years of age or under and does not attend secondary school (unless the child is a member of a class prescribed by the Minister who can be eligible despite not meeting this criteria (

2.6.2.10

))

the child meets immunisation requirements, and

the individual, or their partner, meets the residency requirements.

An individual is eligible for CCS for a session of care if, in addition to meeting the 4 criteria above:

the individual, or their partner, has a genuine liability to pay for the care under a

CWA

(

1.1.C.52

), and

the session of care

is provided in Australia (

1.1.A.120

)

is not provided as part of the compulsory education program in the state or territory where the care is provided, and

is not provided in circumstances outlined in

CCSMinRules

section 8.

In addition, there are circumstances where there is no eligibility for a session of care, as well as limitations on eligibility (

2.6.1

).

CCS entitlement

The amount of CCS an individual is entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to is dependent upon:

the combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of the individual and their partner, if they have one

the level of participation of the individual and their partner, if they have one

the type of approved child care service used, and whether the child attends school (

1.1.C.18

), and

whether the individual, or their partner, has 2 or more children aged 5 or under using child care.

Higher CCS for multiple children

Families with income below the upper income threshold for the higher CCS rate (

1.1.I.70

) and more than one child aged 5 or under in care can get a higher subsidy for one of more of their children, up to a maximum 95%.

To receive the higher subsidy, an individual must meet the eligibility requirements for CCS (

2.6.1

).

From 10 July 2023, the rates for each child are worked out using 2 separate income tests.

Services Australia will work out which children get the higher subsidy by:

assessing all children in the family aged 5 or under

identifying the standard rate child (

1.1.S.104

), and

identifying the higher rate child/ren (

1.1.H.15

).

The ‘standard rate child’ is usually the eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or under. From 10 July 2023, the standard rate child will get the standard CCS rates.

The ‘higher rate child’ is the second and any younger children aged 5 or under. The higher rate for second and younger children is calculated using the higher CCS rate (

3.5.1

).

For children born on the same day, Services Australia will automatically determine the standard rate child, unless an individual or their partner requests a different order.

Children entitled to both the higher CCS rate and ACCS (

1.2.7

) will be paid the ACCS rate.

Sessions of

IHC

do not attract the higher subsidy. However, children aged 5 or under in IHC are counted as part of the family for the purposes of determining the standard rate child.

Example:

A family with a standard rate child in IHC will get the higher subsidy for younger children who attend other care types, for example,

CBDC

,

FDC

or

OSHC

.

How CCS is paid

CCS is paid to approved providers to pass on as a fee reduction to individuals. In limited circumstances CCS may be paid directly to individuals prior to reconciliation. Any subsidy owed to the individual after reconciliation (

1.1.R.10

) is paid directly to the individual as a lump sum.

4.2.2.20 Specific requirements for past period claim

Specific restrictions for past period claims

Note:

Individuals have 12 months after the income year (

1.1.I.75

) to lodge a past period claim.

Example:

Vicki wants to lodge a past period claim for the 2023-24 income year. Therefore, she has until 30 June 2025 to lodge her claim.

There are several restrictions, which affect whether a past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) for

FTB

can be effective (

1.1.E.10

). These include:

whether a previous claim has been made or determined

the income year the claim relates to, and

whether the individual or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) receives an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

).

Previous claim or instalment determination

The following table outlines the restrictions applying where there is a previous claim or instalment (

1.1.I.100

) determination. If any condition is met, the claim is not effective and the corrective action outlined in column 2 is taken.

Specific claim condition

If condition is met refer to …

The claim is for a past period for which a claim has already been made.

Explanation:

It is not possible to claim twice for the same period.

Example:

Jane gives birth on 10 July and lodges a claim for FTB on 24 August. Her claim for FTB is rejected as her estimated income is above her FTB income limit. After her husband loses his job, she lodges a second claim on 24 November with a lower income estimate that is below her FTB income limit. FTB by instalment is granted from 24 November based on this revised estimate. The past period claim is ineffective as a claim has already been made for this period. Jane is advised to seek arrears for this past period after income has been verified by the

ATO

.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.2

Internal reviews - refer to 'Further requirement for an application for review relating to an income estimate'

4.2.4.40

Claim action 4 - second claim lodged

The claim is for a past period where the individual was entitled to FTB by fortnightly payments.

Explanation:

In order for the individual to be entitled to FTB instalments, they would have had to lodge a claim and have had it determined. It is not possible to claim twice for the same period.

4.2.4.50

Claim action 5 - already entitled to FTB instalments

The claim for a past period is made before the end of the income year that follows an income year where the individual's entitlement to fortnightly FTB instalments was cancelled for one of the following reasons:

failure to provide

TFN

failure to provide bank details

failure to provide information

failure to notify a change of address

estimate of income was not reasonable

the FTB child made a claim for a social security benefit (

1.1.S.60

), pension (

1.1.S.90

) or a

LMP

(

1.1.L.10

), or

failure to notify departure from Australia (FA(Admin)Act section 30A and section 30B).

Explanation:

If a decision to cancel an instalment claim has been made, a past period claim for that income year cannot be made for the same period. The original decision must be reviewed favourably in order to pay FTB for the rest of that income year.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 27 Variation of instalment and past period determinations where failure to provide tax file number, section 27A Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to provide bank account details, section 28A Variation of instalment entitlement determination where estimate of an amount is not reasonable, section 28B Variation of instalment entitlement determination where claim made for another payment type, section 29 Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to provide information, section 30 Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to notify change of address, section 30A Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to notify claimant's departure from Australia, section 30B Variation of instalment entitlement determination where failure to notify FTB or regular care child's departure from Australia

4.2.4.60

Claim action 6 - instalments cancelled in previous income year

Income year the claim relates to

The following table outlines how to treat past period claims depending on which income year the claim relates to. If any condition is met, column 2 outlines the action to follow.

Specific claim condition

If condition is met …

The past period does not fall wholly within one income year.

Note:

Separate claim forms are required for different financial years.

separate determinations are required for each income year. The claim for the past period in the current income year must be accompanied by an instalment claim (explained later in this topic).

Determination for entitlement for previous income year cannot be finalised until

ATI

is provided by the ATO for the individual and/or their partner, or the individual and/or their partner notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

Explanation:

The need for separate determinations is because entitlement is based on different income amounts for each income year.

The period falls wholly within one income year, the claim is lodged in the year after the relevant income year.

determination for entitlement for previous income year cannot be finalised until ATI is provided by the ATO for the individual and/or their partner, or the individual and/or their partner notifies Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

The period falls partly or wholly within one income year, but the claim is made after the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

).

refer to

4.2.4.70

Claim action 7 - claim made too late.

Explanation:

An FTB claim can be made up to the end of the lodgement year after (the year after the year in which eligibility commences).

Note:

If 30 June of the lodgement year falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday, an effective claim can be lodged on the first working day after 30 June.

Example:

Treatment of past period claims which fall within 2 income years.

Sally lodges a claim for FTB on 1 September 2023, following the birth of her child on 1 May 2023. Sally is claiming:

for the past period in the 2022-23 income year

for the past period in the 2023-24 income year, and

for ongoing instalments.

Separate determinations are required for each period and separate forms for each financial year lodged. The past period of FTB from 1 May 2023 to 30 June 2023 is assessed on actual ATI for the income year provided by the ATO. The past period of FTB from 1 July 2023 to 31 August 2023 and Sally's ongoing entitlement are assessed on an estimate of income for the current income year.

Restrictions on determining FTB claims

Claims relating to the current year

A past period claim must be accompanied by an instalment claim if:

the past period occurs in the income year which the claim is made, and

on the date of the claim the individual

is eligible for FTB (

1.1.E.17

), and

the instalment claim would be effective.

If the individual does not accompany a past period claim with an instalment claim in these circumstances, the past period claim is not effective.

If the individual is not eligible for FTB at the time of the past period claim or is prevented from making an effective claim (that is, the individual is already receiving FTB by instalments or has previously made a claim for payment of FTB by instalment and that claim has not yet been determined), then they are not required to accompany their past period claim with an instalment claim.

Requirements for payment of

RA

with a past period claim

An individual who is entitled to FTB Part A for a past period in the income year either before or in the year in which the past period claim is made, may receive any entitlement to RA as a lump sum with their past period payment. However, to receive RA, the past period claim must be accompanied by an instalment claim unless:

the individual is prevented from making an effective instalment claim (that is, the individual is not eligible for FTB at the time the past period claim is made)

the individual is already receiving FTB by instalments, or

the individual has previously lodged an instalment claim which has not yet been determined.

Note:

The term 'resident parent' has been replaced by the term 'payee' (

1.1.P.71

) since 1 July 2008.

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, a resident parent was the person with whom a child lived all or most of the time and who had care of the child. The resident parent could also be known as the carer, or payee for child support purposes. The resident parent was the child's natural or adoptive parent.

5.1.2 Comparing information with other agencies

Introduction

The Commonwealth has the power to obtain information for the purposes of verifying that a person (

1.1.P.80

) has provided Centrelink with the correct information about their circumstances, as well as their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) and/or their children's personal circumstances.

Comparing information with other agencies

Comparing information with other agencies is an effective method of verifying information about a person that has been obtained and/or is held by Centrelink for the purposes of

FA

law.

Example:

Where no birth certificate is available, verifying the existence of a child for which a person is claiming

FTB

may be done by matching records with the Registrar General's Office.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 154 General power to obtain information, section 157 Obtaining information to verify claims etc., section 76 Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act debts

Data matching using

TFN

s

A person may unintentionally or deliberately fail to declare all relevant income details. Data matching using a person's TFN is an effective method of verifying information about individuals of FA payments. The verified information is obtained and/or held by Centrelink for the purpose of verifying eligibility, entitlement and amounts of FA paid under FA law.

Explanation:

An individual's TFN may be used for data matching in order to verify whether or not they were entitled to a payment.

Debts arising from data matching process

Data matching may establish that a person was not entitled to receive FA. In these circumstances a debt recoverable under the FA law may occur if:

an amount of FA has been paid to the person, and

the amount is a debt due to the Commonwealth under subsection 11(6) of the

Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990

1.1.P.74 Payment nominee

Usage

This definition applies to all

FA

payments.

Definition

A payment nominee is a person (

1.1.P.80

), other than the individual in receipt of FA, who may be appointed to receive the whole or part of the individual's FA payment. This arrangement is made under the direction of the Secretary, and under normal circumstances, with the written consent of the person to be appointed and after taking into consideration the wishes (if any) of the individual regarding the making of such an appointment.

A payment nominee may also be appointed for an individual if the Attorney-General gives the Minister a security notice relating to the individual following:

the cancellation of a visa by the Immigration Minister, or

the cancellation of an Australian passport or the refusal to issue an Australian passport by the Foreign Affairs Minister.

Where a security notice is issued, FA payments may be directed to be paid to a payment nominee appointed by the Secretary. In those circumstances, the payment nominee must use the payments in accordance with a written direction of the Secretary. In appointing a payment nominee, the Secretary is not required to take into account the wishes of the individual whose payments are to be redirected. The nominee must adhere to all legislative requirements of payment nominees (

4.1.3.10

), as modified by the FAAct section 57GI.

1.1.P.20 Parenting plan

Background

Parenting plans/orders were introduced into the

Family Law Act 1975

, in 1996 by the Family Law Reform. The plans/orders can be compared to custody/court orders (

1.1.C.70

) that were issued before the Law Reform.

Generally, parenting plans/orders give both parents (

1.1.P.10

) equal legal responsibility (

1.1.L.20

) for their child, unless specified otherwise. If a parenting plan/order does not specify that only one person has legal responsibility for the child, it is taken that each parent has joint legal responsibility for the child.

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

and the SSAct, a parenting plan has the meaning given by the Family Law Act section 63C. Generally, it is a written agreement made between the parents of a child, which is signed and dated by both parents. Parenting plans deal with any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child, or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child. They are an alternative to court making decisions about such matters. A parenting plan may specify:

who cares for a child

the amount of time a child spends with each parent, and

how both parents will share their duties and responsibilities for raising their child.

Examples:

Arrangements for residence, contact and child support.

7.7.1 Making a departure prohibition order

Summary

The Secretary can make a

DPO

, preventing an individual with an

FA

debt from leaving Australia.

Making a DPO

The Secretary has the discretion to make a DPO in a case where all 3 conditions below are satisfied:

the relevant individual has one or more outstanding FA debts

they have not made satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge their debts, and

the Secretary believes it is desirable to make such an order to ensure that they do not leave Australia without wholly repaying their debts or making satisfactory arrangements to do so.

Before making an order, the Secretary must also take the following matters into account:

the individual's capacity to pay debt/s

whether any debt recovery action has been taken and the outcome of the recovery action

the length of time the debt/s have remained unpaid (after the day on which it became due and payable), and

any other matters as the Secretary considers appropriate.

What constitutes a satisfactory repayment arrangement will depend on the facts of the case.

The Secretary cannot make a DPO unless all of these conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, as a DPO places significant restrictions on the debtor's freedom of movement, the Secretary will not make a DPO without considering all the relevant circumstances.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102A Secretary may make departure prohibition orders

Secretary believes it is desirable to make a DPO

The purpose of a DPO is to secure payment of an individual's FA debts. As such, the Secretary will not make a DPO unless there are grounds for the reasonable belief that making the order will make recovery of the debt more likely.

Situations where a DPO may be appropriate include:

The debtor is about to leave Australia - regardless of any plans to return.

The debtor is transferring assets offshore, either directly or indirectly (for example, borrowing funds overseas by securing Australian assets).

The debtor has resources, whether financial or otherwise, that would enable them to live offshore, such as family, assets, employment or a business.

Departure from Australia prohibited

A DPO made against an individual will prevent them from leaving Australia before either discharging all their debts or making satisfactory arrangements to do so.

A DPO places significant restrictions on the freedom of movement of citizens and residents of Australia and visitors to Australia, and will not be made without consideration of all relevant circumstances.

A DPO does not prohibit travel to Australia's external territories (for example, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island).

Once a DPO is made, it is in force from the time it is made until it is revoked or set aside by a court. However, the Secretary must revoke a DPO in certain circumstances and may revoke or vary it in other circumstances. The Secretary can revoke or vary a DPO after becoming aware of new information or in response to representations made by the debtor.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102B Departure from Australia of debtors prohibited, section 102D Operation of departure prohibition order

Revoking a DPO

The Secretary must revoke a DPO in any of the following 3 circumstances:

The debts have been wholly discharged.

This condition is met when any combination of repayments, debt waivers or write-offs results in no portion of the debtor's debts being repayable.

The Secretary is satisfied that there are satisfactory repayment arrangements to wholly repay these debts.

A common sense approach is required to determine whether arrangements are satisfactory in each case. A repayment arrangement that requires the presence of the debtor in Australia to function is not a satisfactory arrangement. Where the debtor has sold property and needs to leave Australia before settlement occurs, a garnishee notice in relation to the known proceeds would be a satisfactory arrangement.

The Secretary is satisfied that the debts will be completely irrecoverable.

An individual's debt will be regarded as completely irrecoverable when there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to make any payment towards it.

Even when the tests outlined above are not satisfied, the Secretary has the discretion to revoke a DPO where they believe it is desirable to do so. The Secretary will exercise this discretion in a way that supports the intended policy.

Varying a DPO

The Secretary also has discretion to vary a DPO. They can only use this discretion to correct errors on the face of the order.

The Secretary will not vary a DPO to allow a debtor to depart Australia. Where the Secretary is satisfied that it is appropriate and necessary for a debtor to depart Australia, for a defined period, the Secretary will either revoke the DPO or issue a

DAC

.

Notification requirements to make, vary or revoke a DPO

Where the Secretary makes a DPO in respect of an individual, the Secretary must notify:

the individual to whom the DPO applies

the Australian Border Force

the Australian Federal Police, and

where the individual is not an Australian citizen, the Department of Home Affairs.

Due to the consequences of a DPO, the Secretary will make every effort to ensure that the individual receives a copy of the DPO as soon as possible after the order is made.

Where the Secretary makes a decision to vary or revoke a DPO, the individual to whom the order applies and any other individual to whom a copy of the order was provided must be notified. The Secretary must also notify the individual where they have rejected the individual's application to vary or revoke a DPO.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102C Notification requirements for departure prohibition orders, section 102F Notification requirements for revocations and variations

Enforcement

Australian Border Force officers and members of the Australian Federal Police are authorised to prevent the overseas departure of an individual subject to a DPO.

If an officer believes that an individual is about to depart from Australia when a DPO is in force and without a DAC, they can require the individual to answer questions or produce documents.

An individual is required to answer these questions, even if the answers may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty. However, their answers are not admissible in evidence against them except in relation to a prosecution for providing false or misleading information or documents.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 102B Departure from Australia of debtors prohibited, section 102S Powers of officers of Customs and members of the Australian Federal Police, section 102T Privilege against self-incrimination, section 102U Production of authority to depart

Offences

It is an offence for an individual to depart from Australia for a foreign country:

knowing that, or reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and

the individual's departure is not authorised by a DAC, and the individual knows the departure is not authorised by such a certificate, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by such a certificate.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

An individual commits an offence if they fail to answer a question or produce a document that would assist an officer to establish whether a DPO is in force or whether the individual has a DAC, and they are capable of doing so.

Penalty: 30 penalty units.

It is also an offence of strict liability if an individual who has a valid DAC fails to produce the certificate at the request of an authorised officer.

Penalty: 5 penalty units

An individual who provides false or misleading answers to questions commits an offence and can be prosecuted.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months.

An attempt to commit any of these offences is punishable as though the actual offence had been committed.

3.1.9.10 Calculating FTB Part B

Summary

This topic covers the following in relation to calculating

FTB

Part B:

calculating the FTB Part B rate

effect on standard rate of FTB Part B because of

PLP

effect on standard rate of FTB Part B because of age of youngest child

effect of being a single parent or member of a couple

effect on the standard rate where care is shared, and

effect on entitlement to FTB Part B where the youngest child is 16 years or over.

For information on how FTB Part A and FTB Part B are exempt from the income test for

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for periods during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) when the individual and/or their partner receive income support payments refer to

6.4.2.20

.

Calculating the FTB Part B rate

The rate of FTB Part B is affected by:

the age of the youngest child

whether the individual is a single parent or a member of a couple

whether the individual is a grandparent or great-grandparent

the level of income

shared care, and

parental leave pay.

Effect on standard rate of FTB Part B because of PLP

The standard rate (

1.1.S.103

) of FTB Part B will be a nil rate on a day for which PLP is payable to the individual or their partner.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 28C Paid parental leave

Effect on standard rate of FTB Part B because of age of youngest child

The standard rate of FTB Part B depends on the age of the youngest child. A higher rate is payable if the youngest child is under 5 years of age in recognition of the additional assistance required for families with children below school age. This also recognises the indirect cost of reduced workforce participation, due to the extra caring requirements of a very young child.

Effect of being a single parent or a member of a couple

The method chosen to calculate the rate of FTB Part B depends on whether the individual is a single parent (Method 1) or a member of a couple (Method 2).

Method 1 - individual is a single parent

Method 1 is used when the individual is a single parent with ATI at or below the income limit. In this case, an eligible individual receives the standard rate of FTB Part B based on the age of the youngest FTB child.

Method 2 - individual is a member of a couple

Method 2 is used when the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) and the primary earner has ATI at or below the income limit. In this case, the primary income earner (

1.1.P.122

) is subject to an initial income test. In the case where the ATI of the primary earner is below the income limit, a secondary earner (

1.1.S.25

) income test will be applied. Under Method 2, the standard rate of FTB Part B applicable to the eligible individual based on the age of the youngest FTB child is reduced by 20c for each dollar of the secondary income earner's ATI over the income free area (

1.1.I.40

).

Special arrangements may apply to eligible lower income earners returning to work for the first time after the birth of a child, or if an eligible child entered their care.

An individual is not eligible for FTB Part B if they are a member of a couple and their youngest child is aged 13 years or over unless the individual is the grandparent or great-grandparent (

1.1.G.15

).

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 28D Member of a couple whose youngest FTB child has turned 13, Schedule 1 clause 29 General method of calculating Part B rate, Schedule 1 clause 30 Standard rate

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.9.30

FTB Part B return to work,

3.1.1.20

Current FTB rates & income test amounts

Effect on the standard rate where care is shared

If the individual is sharing the care of a child and a shared care percentage is determined under FAAct subsection 59(1) in respect of that child, the individual's standard rate is worked out as follows.

If the shared care child is the individual's only child, then the standard rate is the shared care percentage of the standard rate based on the age of this child.

If the individual has more than one FTB child, the standard rate is the higher of the following amounts

the highest amount obtained when the shared care percentage of the standard rate is calculated for each shared care child as though he or she was the only FTB child of the individual, or

the standard rate for the youngest child who is not a shared care child, worked out as though he or she was the only FTB child of the individual.

Effect on entitlement to FTB Part B where the youngest child is 16 years or over

An FTB child who has turned 16 is disregarded in calculating entitlement to FTB Part B unless:

they are a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

)*, and

the calendar year in which the child turns 18 has not ended.

*

Note:

Prior to 1 January 2012 a child would not be disregarded in calculating FTB Part B if the child was aged 16 to 18 and was in full-time secondary or tertiary study, up to the end of the calendar year they turned 18.

If the disregarded child is the individual's only FTB child, then the individual's standard rate of FTB Part B is nil.

3.1.5.40 Maintenance action in progress

Summary

Generally, if the individual has maintenance action in progress, they are taken to have satisfied the

MAT

(

1.1.M.10

) until their case is reviewed.

This topic provides information about:

what types of action in progress satisfy the MAT

extension of child support assessments for children in secondary school

child support action when the payer (

1.1.P.72

) is imprisoned, and

legal advice or action.

Action in progress

The following table shows what types of action for child support satisfy the MAT, and when the individual's situation should be reviewed.

The individual has action in progress if they …

review in …

have applied for a child support assessment

28 days.

have applied for a child support assessment, and the other parent is not a resident of Australia

90 days.

are taking legal action to prove parentage or obtain child support

90 days; or where there is evidence of a court date (outside the 90 days), after that date to determine if circumstances have changed.

have applied to register an overseas maintenance liability where the liable parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction and the amount payable under the overseas maintenance liability is for an amount that would be more or less for the same amount payable under a child support assessment

90 days.

are seeking an exemption from the MAT

60 days.

have been advised that their application for exemption has been denied

14 days.

have applied to the Child Support Registrar for acceptance of a child support agreement

28 days.

Where an

FTB

child is the subject of a child support agreement, and the care arrangements of the child change significantly, there are certain child support actions a parent can take to change from being the payer under the agreement to instead become the payee. This would occur where the care changes are such that the payer under the new agreement has more than 65% care of the child and subsequently becomes the payee.

If an individual has an FTB child they are required to pay child support for under a limited agreement (

3.1.6.45

), they have action in progress if:

the limited child support agreement was made 3 or more years earlier, and the individual has given the Child Support Registrar notice of the termination of the limited agreement for the child, or

the limited child support agreement was made less than 3 years earlier, and

the individual requested a new provisional notional assessment (

3.1.7.14

)

has received notification of the new notional amount, and

the individual has given the Child Support Registrar written notice of the termination of the limited agreement within 60 days.

If an individual has an FTB child they are required to pay child support for under a binding child support agreement (

3.1.6.45

), they have action in progress if the individual seeks the agreement of the other party to give effect to a binding agreement:

that terminates the previous agreement, then commences an administrative assessment for the child, or

which terminates the previous agreement, then commences a new child support agreement that makes the new carer of the child the child support payee.

Where the other party does not consent to terminating the agreement, the individual may elect to apply to a court to terminate the binding agreement. However, court action will not be required to satisfy the MAT.

Extensions of child support assessments for children in secondary school

Parents who are entitled to receive child support and who have a senior secondary school child (

1.1.S.27

) turning 18 are required to take reasonable action to obtain an extension of their child support assessment for that child until the last day of the school year in which the child turns 18, in order to satisfy the MAT. Reasonable action to obtain an extension must be taken before the child's 18th birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances warranting a later application for extension. In most circumstances, this is a continuation of maintenance action, as parents are not taking maintenance action for the first time. As a result, there is no period of grace to take maintenance action (

3.1.5.30

) in these circumstances and parents are expected to have taken reasonable action to extend the child support case by the child's 18th birthday.

The requirement to take reasonable action to obtain an extension also applies to parents who have a child support agreement registered by the Child Support Registrar. Unless an exemption has been granted, parents whose agreement initiated a child support assessment need to take reasonable action to obtain the agreement of the other parent to extend the child support agreement.

Since both the payer and payee's signatures are required to extend the child support case in this situation, if one party attempts to extend the child support case past the child's 18th birthday and the other party refuses to extend the case, the party that attempted to extend the case has taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will not be reduced.

However, in most cases if the payee does not take steps to extend the child support case (obtain maintenance) the payee is deemed to have not taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will be reduced to base rate.

Unless action could result in the payer swapping to be the payee, the payer does not have to take maintenance action for FTB purposes.

Where it would disadvantage one party to extend the agreement it may be appropriate that the refusing party not fail the MAT.

Explanation:

If extending the agreement would result in an individual who now has full-time care of the children being maintained as a payer, they will not fail the MAT if they refuse to extend. Similarly, if extending the agreement would result in an individual who now has no care of the children being maintained as a payee, they will not fail the MAT if they refuse to extend.

Parents with an agreement that modifies a pre-existing child support assessment do not need the consent of the other parent to obtain an extension of the child support assessment. If the parent does not apply to extend the assessment before the child's 18th birthday, the individual has not taken reasonable maintenance action and their rate of FTB Part A for that child will be limited to base rate.

Extending child support assessments past a child's 18th birthday

Payer is imprisoned

Imprisonment of the other parent of a child does not automatically remove their liability for child support. To receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A, the individual must take reasonable maintenance action if they are entitled to claim maintenance in relation to the child (unless a MAT exemption applies).

This requirement only applies where the individual is not considered to be a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) with the other parent. Review in these cases should occur at 12 months.

Explanation:

Where the individual is still partnered (

1.1.P.30

) but receives the single rate of

PP

because their partner is in prison, maintenance action is not appropriate as the separation is primarily due to the partner being imprisoned.

Maintenance action test reviews

Legal advice & action

An individual may have legal advice that their legal representative is unable to assist them. If this is the case, then this circumstance can be used as proof that maintenance action is in progress.

Explanation:

This may be for a number of reasons including where the individual does not have enough information to identify the other parent or where the other parent is overseas in a non-reciprocating jurisdiction for child support purposes and it would not be cost effective to pursue child support.

The individual may also be in the process of obtaining legal advice or pursuing legal action to prove paternity or obtain child support. In these cases, documentary evidence of the legal advice or legal action should be obtained as proof maintenance action is in progress. Proof may include a letter from the individual's legal representative.

2.8.4.40 ACCS (transition to work) - activity requirements

Summary

This topic describes the activity requirements for

ACCS

(transition to work).

To meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements an individual (

1.1.I.90

) must meet at least one of the study requirements, job search requirements, or work/training requirements, which include other programs to improve an individual's employment prospects.

CCS

recognised participation types that meet these requirements are:

paid work

unpaid work

setting up a business

approved course of education or study

training course, or

actively looking for work.

This topic covers:

activity requirements - study

activity requirements - job search

activity requirements - work

activity requirements - training and other programs, and

mutual obligation or participation requirements exemptions while in receipt of ACCS (transition to work).

Activity requirements - study

To meet the study requirements for ACCS (transition to work) an individual must be undertaking at least one approved course of education or study and be making satisfactory progress.

An approved education course for the purposes of ACCS (transition to work) must be a secondary course, a preparatory course or a course between levels 2 to 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF).

An individual may be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) if they are studying full-time or part-time.

Study load requirements for ACCS (transition to work) are the same as the study load requirements for income support payments (

1.1.I.50

) for study activities. If an individual meets the study load requirements for their income support payment, they will also meet the study load requirements for ACCS (transition to work). In general, to be eligible for ACCS (transition to work), an individual needs to be studying at least:

25% of the full-time study load to be considered part-time

75% of the full-time study load to be considered full-time.

If an individual meets the exceptional circumstances requirement of their income support payment, such as for

Austudy

where 66% of the full-time study load is considered full-time, they would also be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) for a full-time study activity.

If an individual is studying less than a 25% of the study load, they will not be eligible for ACCS (transition to work).

To qualify for a study activity, the level of study must be above any level the individual has completed in the last 10 years, and at the same or above any level the individual has already studied at in the last 10 years.

Studying at a higher or lower level

If an individual starts studying at a level higher than level 2 of the AQF, or progresses to a higher level of the AQF, they cannot access ACCS (transition to work) to study at a lower level. This is the case even if they have not completed a qualification or exhausted the time limit, or have not previously accessed ACCS (transition to work) to study at that level (unless the skill shortage exemption applies).

Step up rule

Once an individual has completed a level of study whilst in receipt of ACCS (transition to work), or has exhausted the time limit for the level of study, they are no longer eligible for ACCS (transition to work) for that level of study. To be eligible for further assistance under ACCS (transition to work) in the future, they are required to 'step up' to a higher level of study.

6-week rule exemption

On a single occasion, an individual studied a course of education or study at a higher level than the level at which they are currently studying for a period of less than 6 weeks. This means that this higher period of study will not be counted when applying the step up rule.

Example:

Anna enrols in a diploma course but finds it too demanding and withdraws from the course after 4 weeks. Anna then enrols in a Certificate III. The step up rule is not applied because Anna withdrew from her diploma within 6 weeks. She will be able to receive ACCS (transition to work) to study her Certificate III.

Skill shortage exemption

On a single occasion, an individual may begin studying at a lower level than what they have in the past 10 years if that course of study will qualify them for an occupation on the

Occupation Shortage List

, formerly known as the Skills Priority List.

Transferring courses at level

An individual may change their course of study (within the same level) any number of times, as long as they provide notification of this change.

However, transferring courses will not increase the time limit for the period during which the individual is eligible for ACCS (transition to work). This means that an individual that changes courses will not have their time limit changed or extended as a result of their course transfer. The time limit for that level of study will continue to apply.

Satisfactory progress requirement

If an individual is studying a course from Level 2 to 8 of the AQF, they have to be making satisfactory progress in that course to meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements.

Satisfactory progress means an individual is participating in the course and achieving the minimum requirements of that course to the satisfaction of the course provider (such as achieving a pass grade for at least one of their subjects).

Any individual enrolled in a course that is 12 months or longer, will be required to provide evidence of their progress towards course completion to continue to be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) for that activity. If an individual is attending their course, they will have the opportunity to provide evidence to demonstrate progress.

Any individual enrolled in a course that is less than 12 months long will still be required to provide evidence of their progress, if requested.

If an individual is not attending their course, they are not participating in their activity and are ineligible for ACCS (transition to work).

Example:

Although Jill has been attending classes, she fails her first semester subjects. Jill meets with her course provider and discusses her options for semester 2. She is advised that she will meet the requirements to continue to study in semester 2, if she also participates in a study support program. She enrols in a study support program, and continues to participate in her course. At the end of semester 2, she has passed 3 of her 4 subjects and can provide proof of progression in the form of an academic transcript showing her results for the year. She can also provide the notification from her course provider from the end of semester 1 that confirms their support for her continued study, dependent on enrolment in a study support program. Jill continues to be eligible for ACCS (transition to work).

A Centrelink officer (

1.1.O.10

) can initiate a review of progress at any time and on any ground. If evidence has been requested and not provided within 28 days, or is unsatisfactory, Centrelink may determine that the individual is no longer eligible for ACCS (transition to work) from the Monday of the next CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

).

section 13(7) Study requirements

Activity requirements - job search

To meet the job search requirements for ACCS (transition to work), an individual must be actively looking for work and be able to provide evidence of doing so.

Activities that meet the job search requirements include:

looking for job vacancies

preparing resumes and job applications

contacting potential employers

preparing for, and attending job interviews.

If an individual is in receipt of an income support payment with a mutual obligation requirement to look for work, those requirements will meet the requirements for ACCS (transition to work). However, an individual must still be able to provide evidence if requested.

Act reference:

CCSMinRules

section 13(10) Job search requirements, section 22 Actively looking for work

Activity requirements - work

To meet the work requirements for ACCS (transition to work) an individual must be engaged in:

paid work

unpaid work (including a work experience placement or an internship, or voluntary work which could reasonably be expected to improve their work skills or employment prospects), or

actively setting up a business.

Act reference:

CCSMinRules

section 13(11) Work/training requirements

Activity requirements - training & other programs

To meet the training requirements for ACCS (transition to work) an individual must be undertaking vocational training, or be participating in another program which has a reasonable likelihood of improving their employment prospects.

Courses should have a direct impact on the individual's professional development, including, for example, training courses on:

adult literacy

English language (for example, Skills for Education and Employment (SEE) or the

AMEP

)

improving computer skills

guidance on starting a small business

community based, work skill focused training as listed on

Your Career

.

This activity would not include courses catering primarily to hobbies or personal interests, such as short cooking courses, art appreciation classes, foreign languages or alternative therapies. Individuals who are studying for an industry recognised certificate in one of these activities would be studying an approved course of education or study.

Some government funded work experience activities (

LMP

s) and additional support programs will meet the activity requirements for ACCS (transition to work), and be recognised as a training activity.

For example:

the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations'

Transition to Work employment program

New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS)

language, literacy and numeracy programs such as SEE

the National Indigenous Australians Agency's Remote Australia Employment Service (RAES).

For programs such as Parent Pathways, only specific components of the program will meet the activity requirements for ACCS (transition to work).

For example, participating in a playgroup with their child may be an appropriate activity for Parent Pathways, but it does not meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements.

In these cases, the specific activities parents are participating in would be assessed against the most beneficial ACCS (transition to work) activity, such as job search, work, study, training or other programs depending on the activity they are participating in to meet or exceed their Parent Pathways requirements.

Activities that do not meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements may meet the recognised participation requirements for CCS, and contribute to the individual's total subsidised hours result.

Other programs may include, but are not limited to, government funded rehabilitation, drug and alcohol programs, and parenting courses.

Note:

ACCS (transition to work) is available to participants of the AMEP with school age children. ACCS (transition to work) is not available to participants of the AMEP with under school aged children, as the AMEP provides free child care services for under school aged children, while participants are participating in AMEP classes.

Mutual obligation or participation requirements exemptions while in receipt of ACCS (transition to work)

Eligibility for ACCS (transition to work) is dependent on meeting the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements, not mutual obligation requirements.

If an individual is granted an exemption from their mutual obligation requirements, but continues to meet the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements they will continue to be eligible for ACCS (transition to work).

If an individual is no longer meeting the ACCS (transition to work) activity requirements they would no longer be eligible for ACCS (transition to work); this would be a change of circumstances.

There may be circumstances where an individual granted an exemption from mutual obligation requirements may be eligible for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) (

2.8.3

) (such as in the case of a domestic violence situation or major disaster). In such circumstances it may be beneficial to the individual to apply for ACCS (temporary financial hardship). ACCS (temporary financial hardship) is higher on the ACCS hierarchy and if the individual is eligible, they will receive this subsidy instead of ACCS (transition to work).

Approved catch-up vaccination schedule

An approved catch-up vaccination schedule commences when a child has not been vaccinated according to the National Immunisation Program early childhood schedule and commences a course of late vaccinations. The catch-up vaccination schedule for the child is determined by a recognised immunisation provider (

1.1.R.09

) according to information provided in the

Australian Immunisation Handbook

.

Up-to-date

Up-to-date means that a child is currently not overdue for any of the antigens required under the National Immunisation Program early childhood schedule.

6.6.2 Effect of non-entitlement due to underestimation of income

Summary

FTB

individuals' and their partner's access to FTB Part A (and benefits linked to FTB Part A) and/or FTB Part B based on an estimate will cease if they:

advise or have been provided with (by automatic uplift) an income estimate which results in an FTB Part A and/or FTB Part B (primary earner income estimate only) legislative rate greater than nil for 2 consecutive income years, and

are reconciled as having a nil (zero) legislative entitlement for the same FTB component in both those income years due to their actual

ATI

being higher than their estimate.

Example:

Joe has had his FTB entitlement reconciled as nil due to underestimation of income for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 years. He will not be able to access fortnightly instalments from 1 July 2012.

Loss of entitlement to FTB Part A will preclude the individual (and their partner, if applicable) from accessing ancillary benefits via FTB such as:

the lower threshold of the Extended Medicare Safety Net from the start of the following calendar year

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and

health care card.

However, some individuals may be able to access these benefits if they are eligible for certain income support payments or concession cards.

What is underestimation of income

Income years where non-entitlement is attributable to something other than underestimation of income will not be included in the count for this process. The individual must have been entitled in the year based on an estimate (and their correct non-income circumstances) and then subsequently not entitled based on their actual ATI.

There may be cases where an individual was originally entitled based on their estimate throughout the year, but a revised non-income related factor (such as the backdated loss of entitlement for one of their FTB children) subsequently means that the individual would not have been entitled based on their estimate (for example, due to a lower income cut-out for FTB Part A instalments for the revised circumstances). Such circumstances would not be counted as a year of non-entitlement.

Example:

Tim received instalments of FTB Part A for 2 children based on an estimate for the 2010-11 financial year. At reconciliation it is determined he had underestimated his income and had zero entitlement for that year. It is then established that he failed to notify that one child ceased to be in his care, which meant he had one FTB child only during that year. He would not have been entitled based on his estimate for that year, as the income cut-out for fortnightly FTB Part A for one child is lower than his estimate and his actual income was determined to equal or exceed that cut-out. While Tim would not have been entitled based on his estimate and correct non-income circumstances, that income year would not be counted as a consecutive year for this purpose, despite the fact he is also not entitled based on his actual income.

2.11.2 SIFS qualifying child

Introduction

From 1 July 2017,

SIFS

will be closed to new recipients. Grandfathering arrangements will permit eligible recipients with entitlement to SIFS at 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS as long as they remain eligible for the payment. See

2.11.1.

A SIFS qualifying child is an

FTB

child (

2.1.1

) who is a resident of Australia (

2.1.2.10

) and not an absent overseas FTB child (

2.1.2.40

).

A SIFS qualifying child also includes a child who would be an FTB child (

2.1.1

) except that the child (or someone on the child's behalf) is receiving an 'at home' rate of one of the following payments:

disability support pension

youth allowance

special benefit

ABSTUDY

living allowance, or

an education allowance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme.

Example:

If a person receives

SpB

, but would otherwise be on

YA

under the YA qualifying child definition, and otherwise also be an FTB child if they were not receiving SpB, then they are eligible to be assessed for SIFS.

In some circumstances the child can be a SIFS qualifying child, even if they are on job seeker YA. For example:

Young people aged 18 and 19 years old on job seeker YA may be a SIFS qualifying child for part of the financial year (that is, from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012) where they were previously studying toward and completed their year 12 certificate.

Children aged under 18 years old on job seeker YA who had completed year 12 (for example, May 2012) - remain a SIFS qualifying child for the entire 2012-13 financial year or up until their 18th birthday.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 57G When an individual is eligible for SIFS in normal circumstances

Death of child before the payment is made

SIFS can be paid to an individual whose child dies, provided the eligibility requirements for SIFS are met.

In cases where an individual is eligible for SIFS with one qualifying child and that child dies, the individual remains eligible for SIFS for 14 weeks after the death of the qualifying child.

In cases where the only qualifying child dies and the ensuing 14-week bereavement period spans 2 financial years, the payment for the period in the second financial year will be paid on the assumption that the individual's taxable income for the second financial year is the same as the first financial year and the individual's partner's (if relevant) taxable income for the second financial year is the same as the first financial year.

4.6.1.20 CCS - determination on effective claim

Summary

This topic contains information on outcomes resulting from the assessment of an effective

CCS

claim (

1.1.C.27

):

an initial determination of eligibility, and

notification of indicative entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) information (including nil entitlement).

Initial determination of eligibility

When an individual (

1.1.I.90

) makes an effective CCS claim in respect of a child, Centrelink must make an initial determination of the individual's eligibility in respect of that child.

The initial determination of eligibility will be based on whether the individual meets the CCS eligibility requirements, using:

the information provided by the individual in the claim

other relevant information held by Centrelink (where the individual is an existing Centrelink customer), and

other relevant information held by third parties (for example, Department of Home Affairs,

ATO

).

If Centrelink determines that the individual does meet the eligibility requirements in respect of the child, they will be notified that their claim for CCS by fee reduction has been granted. This means weekly entitlement determinations can be made for the individual following submission of session reports (

1.1.S.35

) for the child by an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

).

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.6.1

CCS eligibility,

4.6.1.10

CCS - making an effective claim

Date of effect - initial determination of eligibility

Where a determination of initial eligibility is made, the date of effect will be the first day on which the individual met the eligibility requirements (

2.6.1

) that is also:

the first Monday of a CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

), and

not more than 28 days before the claim was made.

Example:

A child commences at an approved child care service on Monday 2 October 2023 and attends for a 2-month period (until 1 December 2023). The child's mother submits an effective CCS claim on 20 November 2023 and is found to be eligible (and entitled) to receive CCS for the child. The family will receive CCS subsidy payments backdated to Monday 30 October 2023, as the earliest day the mother met the eligibility requirements that was also the first Monday of a CCS fortnight not more than 28 days before the claim was made.

Notification of indicative entitlement information

When making a claim for CCS, individuals are required to provide additional details, such as their estimated combined

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) and details of recognised participation the individual (and their partner (

1.1.P.30

), if applicable) are undertaking. Centrelink will use these additional details to provide the individual with initial information about their CCS entitlement including:

their CCS percentage, and

their subsidised hours result (number of subsidised hours per fortnight).

Individuals must notify Centrelink as soon as practicable if there is a change in their circumstances that might affect their eligibility or entitlement.

Note:

A CCS annual cap, which placed a limit on the amount of subsidy a child could receive per year, applied prior to the 2021–22 financial year. The annual cap was removed from the 2021–22 financial year onwards.

Eligible individuals with nil entitlement

Individuals can meet the CCS eligibility requirements but not be entitled to receive CCS based on their reported income or recognised participation type at CCS claim. This occurs when the individual's estimated combined ATI for the financial year is more than the high income threshold, or they or their partner do meet, and are not exempt from the activity test.

Where an individual is eligible for CCS but with a nil entitlement, and their child uses an approved child care service, CCS payments can commence if the individual provides new information to Centrelink about their circumstances (including at income review (

1.1.R.10

)) which may result in them being entitled to more than nil for the relevant financial year.

Example:

Elsie makes a claim for CCS on behalf of her and her partner Clark. Elsie and Clark meet the CCS eligibility requirements, but their combined estimated ATI exceeds $535,279. Therefore, Elsie will be eligible for CCS but will not be entitled to receive CCS payments. Determinations of no entitlement are made in respect of the session reports submitted by Elise and Clark's approved provider for their child. Following income review the family's actual ATI is determined to be $510,000, meaning the estimate of combined family income provided by Elsie at claim was incorrect, and the family was not above the upper income threshold for the financial year. Elise's actual CCS entitlement will be calculated (for the eligible sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) reported for her child throughout year) based on a CCS percentage of 6% and paid to Elsie as a lump sum (pending the repayment of other debts etc.). This outcome will only occur if Elsie lodged her CCS claim a maximum of 28 days after her child commenced in child care (despite having nil entitlement at that time) as eligibility for CCS can only be backdated up to a maximum of 28 days.

Example:

Jenny makes a claim for CCS on behalf of her and her partner Liam. Jenny and Liam meet the CCS eligibility requirements, and their combined family income estimate is $90,000. However, Liam stays home to care for their child and does not undertake a recognised participation type for CCS purposes.

Jenny’s family is eligible for the basic subsidy amount of 72 hours per fortnight, regardless of their participation level.

If Jenny and Liam later undertake more than 48 hours of recognised participation per fortnight, their entitlement will increase to 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight.

2.8.1.20 ACCS (child wellbeing) - where a child is at risk of serious abuse or neglect

Note:

The following section describes situations in which children may be 'at risk' of serious abuse or neglect. It includes mention of sexual, physical, emotional, and psychological abuse, domestic and family violence, and neglect.

Summary

This topic describes the circumstances in which a child is at risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect, and covers:

where a child is at risk of serious abuse or neglect,

where a child is not necessarily at risk of serious abuse or neglect.

Where a child is at risk of serious abuse or neglect

For the purposes of

ACCS

(child wellbeing), a child is taken to be at risk of serious abuse or neglect if the child is at risk of experiencing harm, as a result of being subject to, or exposed to one or more of the following:

serious physical, emotional or psychological abuse

sexual abuse

domestic or family violence (

1.1.F.15

), or

neglect, that is, a failure to be provided with the basic needs that are essential for the child’s physical and emotional wellbeing.

A child can be at risk even if:

the abuse or neglect was not intentional – for example, a parent who falls seriously ill may not be able to meet their child’s basic physical and emotional needs, or

the child did not directly experience the event or circumstance – for example, a child whose parent experiences violence at the hands of their partner may be harmed, even if the child doesn’t directly experience violence.

Example:

Charlotte and her mum Tracy live in a small apartment. Charlotte regularly witnessed how her mother's partner sexually and physically abused Tracy. Tracy and her partner are now separated, but Charlotte has been deeply disturbed and is still suffering the consequences, for example, by having anxiety attacks, nightmares and an inability to trust strangers. Charlotte has been identified as meeting the definition of at risk, as she experienced harm in the past, which continues to impact her.

At risk also includes situations where the child is likely to experience those circumstances in the future, in that the risk is 'real and apparent'.

Example:

Chloe seems to not be putting on weight and the approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) is concerned that she may be at risk. Chloe's parents (

1.1.P.10

) explain that Chloe has been diagnosed with Coeliac's Disease and they need to discuss her dietary needs at child care based on the changes they are introducing at home. In this case, the risk that Chloe is likely to experience neglect in the future is not 'real and apparent'.

Any child who is identified as being at risk by a child protection authority will meet the definition of at risk and, if other criteria for making the ACCS (child wellbeing) payment (

2.8.1.10

) are satisfied, an individual (

1.1.I.90

) or an approved provider (

4.13.2.40

) may therefore become eligible to receive the ACCS (child wellbeing) payment.

Where a child is not necessarily at risk of serious abuse or neglect

There are certain circumstances that, on their own, do not mean that a child should be taken to be at serious risk of abuse or neglect. These include:

The income of the individual or individuals with respect to whom the child is an FTB child or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

).

The ethnic, cultural, religious or racial background of the child or the child's immediate family.

The geographical location in which the child and the child's immediate family resides.

The child's place of residence is statistically an area of socio-economic disadvantage.

The child is likely to benefit from early childhood education and care programs.

The child has a disability.

The child is in a foster care or kinship care arrangement.

Example:

Lucy and Camille receive income support as their family’s sole source of income. While this can be financially challenging, on its own, it does not put their child Jack at risk of serious abuse or neglect.

Example:

Amez’s family are refugees from Iraq and do not speak English. His family fled racial persecution in Iraq and are living in a town in regional Australia. There are no other families with a similar background in Amez’s town. Amez’s ethnicity alone does not mean that he is at risk of serious abuse or neglect. However, Amez’s mother Ashti suffers from serious post-traumatic stress disorder from her experiences in Iraq. Ashti does not have friends or family nearby to provide support. Ashti’s emotional state sometimes impacts on her ability to meet Amez’s basic needs. In this circumstance, Amez’s background has contributed to the circumstances placing him at risk of neglect but is not a reason by itself to assume neglect is happening.

Waiving recovery of a debt in special circumstances

Services Australia may waive the right to recover all, or part, of an FA debt if special circumstances exist (other than financial hardship alone) that make it desirable to waive the debt, it is more appropriate to waive than to write off the debt, and ONE of the following applies:

The debt did not result (wholly or partly) from the debtor or another person knowingly making a false statement or a false representation, or failing or omitting to comply with a provision of the FA law.

The debt resulted (wholly or partly) from such an act, failure or omission by the debtor, but that act, failure or omission was justified in the circumstances.

The debt resulted (wholly or partly) from such an act, failure or omission by another person, but the debtor

did not know about the act, failure or omission, or

was justified in the circumstances for not correcting the act, failure or omission.

Although a debt may not be waived where financial hardship is the only special circumstance, it may still be written off (

7.3.1

).

Services Australia is required to make discretionary decisions based on the facts of individual cases when deciding whether to waive a debt due to special circumstances.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

When it is desirable to waive a debt

In

Davy and Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations

(2007) AATA 1114

, the

AAT

held that:

‘special circumstances’ are not merely directed to the person's own circumstances. Rather they are directed to those that are 'special circumstances … that make it desirable to waive'. That necessarily requires a consideration of the person's individual circumstances but also a consideration of the general administration of the social security system.

The integrity of the FA system relies on recovery of debts. In general, if a person had the use and advantage of the money paid incorrectly to them and has the means to repay it without excessive hardship (for example, through withholdings), they should do so.

The special circumstances waiver is appropriate only if the person's particular circumstances make it unfair for that general principle to apply. The debtor’s circumstances need to distinguish their situation from that of the many other people who do have to repay their debts.

When it is more appropriate to write off a debt

In applying the special circumstances waiver, Services Australia must consider whether it is more appropriate to waive the debt than write off the debt.

A debt may only be written off in certain circumstances (

7.3.1

).

It may be more appropriate to write off the debt for a period of time if the debtor’s circumstances limiting their capacity to repay the debt are likely to be temporary and recovery of the debt would be possible and desirable in future.

If the debtor’s only special circumstances are financial hardship, the debt cannot be waived under the special circumstances waiver. In these circumstances it may be more appropriate to write off the debt for a period of time.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 95 Secretary may write off debt, section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

Waiving a debt in full or in part

The special circumstances waiver is not ‘all or nothing’. The special circumstances waiver can be used to reduce part of a person’s debt (for example, by 20% or 50%, or by a fixed amount) where Services Australia considers recovery of the full debt amount would not be desirable, but some recovery is still warranted.

Where appropriate, the proportion waived can have regard to the proportion of the debt that is affected by the person’s circumstances that are considered special.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

What are special circumstances

In

Beadle and Director-General of Social Security

(1984) 1 AATA 176

, the AAT held that 'an expression such as special circumstances is by its very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition'. Further, the AAT held that special circumstances 'looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur'. The person’s circumstances must be considered in their entirety.

Circumstances can be considered unusual, uncommon or exceptional when taken in context or in combination with other circumstances. The impact of the circumstances on the individual should also be considered when considering whether circumstances are sufficiently special.

Explanation:

Family and domestic violence is experienced by many people. This does not preclude it from being considered as part of determining whether special circumstances exist, in the context of how it has affected a specific individual and their broader circumstances.

The decision to waive a debt due to special circumstances should take into account all of the person's circumstances and would usually be based on a combination of factors. This could include factors such as family and domestic violence or addiction or dependence on drugs, alcohol or gambling. See

Factors historically considered when applying the special circumstances waiver

for more information below.

The circumstances being considered by Services Australia can relate to any time period. The special circumstances do not need to relate to the cause of the debt. Services Australia may decide that it is desirable to waive the debt because the person had special circumstances when the debt arose, or during the period the debt was identified, raised for recovery and repaid. Services Australia may also decide that it is desirable to waive the debt because the person is currently experiencing special circumstances.

Example:

A debtor has an FA debt from 3 years ago. Recently, they applied for a review of the debt. Services Australia determined that while the debtor had the capacity to repay the debt at the time it was incurred, the debtor now has special circumstances at the time of review as they are experiencing homelessness. Therefore, Services Australia waives the FA debt.

There is nothing in FA(Admin)Act section 101 that limits the broad discretion available to Services Australia to determine that a person's circumstances are special enough to make it desirable to waive a debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

Interaction of 'administrative error' & special circumstances

Sole administrative error by the Commonwealth, considered on its own, would not generally lead to a special circumstances waiver. Section 97 of the FA(Admin)Act is a specific waiver provision for debts attributable solely to an administrative error.

However, taken in context, an administrative error may sometimes combine with other circumstances to create a situation that is, overall, special.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 97 Waiver of debt arising from error, section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

Interpretation of ‘knew’ & 'knowingly' for the purposes of this provision

FA(Admin)Act section 101 requires Services Australia to determine whether the debt arose because the debtor, or another person, knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of FA law.

Where a debt resulted from such an act, failure or omission by another person, Services Australia must also consider whether the debtor knew about that act, failure or omission. If the debtor did know about the other person’s act, failure or omission, then Services Australia is required to consider whether it was justified in the circumstances for the debtor not to correct that act, failure or omission.

Decisions regarding 'knowingly', ‘know’ and 'knew' should be based on an assessment of what the debtor or another person actually knew in the particular case.

In

Callaghan and Secretary, Department of Social Security

(1996) 45 ALD 435

, the AAT held that where the debtor has actual knowledge not merely constructive knowledge, that their statements or representations are false, or that they did not comply with the provisions of the various Acts, they will have knowingly committed these acts. Actual knowledge is to be ascertained by reference to the statements of the person as to their actual state of knowledge at the time and to events surrounding the false statement or the act or omission.

In

Jonauskas; Secretary, Department of Families and Community Services

(2001) AATA 72

, Deputy President Forgie reiterated the position she had adopted in Re Callaghan that knowingly in the context of SSAct section 1237AAD 'is a deliberate choice and means actual knowledge' (at (73)). It does not encompass reckless disregard, although recklessness could be relevant in determining whether special circumstances existed.

In

Nisha and Secretary, Department of Family and Community Services

(2000) AATA 315

the Applicant’s child was born with disability and had ongoing health issues that required medical treatment. This caused the Applicant to experience depression. The Tribunal found that while the Applicant had the opportunity to advise of a change in their circumstances, their capacity to properly consider their situation and deal with their responsibilities was severely impaired and reduced. The Tribunal found that although the Applicant failed to meet their obligations, this was not done so knowingly, given their impaired capacity to understand and meet their obligations.

It is a civil standard of proof as to whether, on the balance of probabilities, the debtor knowingly made a conscious and deliberate choice.

Interpretation of 'justified in the circumstances' for the purposes of this provision

Where a debtor knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of FA law in connection with a debt, the special circumstances waiver can only be applied if the debtor’s act, failure or omission was ‘justified in the circumstances’.

Where another person knowingly made a false statement or representation, or failed or omitted to comply with a provision of the FA law in connection with a debt, and the debtor knew about that act, failure or omission, the special circumstances waiver can only be applied if it was justified in the circumstances that the debtor did not correct that act, failure or omission.

In considering whether a debtor was justified in the circumstances Services Australia must consider the person’s circumstances in their entirety. ‘Justified’ is interpreted as having its ordinary meaning, that is ‘acceptable or having good cause or reason’ or ‘to show a satisfactory reason or excuse for something done’.

This means, in relation to the cause of the relevant debt, for the debtor’s conduct to be justified, Services Australia must be satisfied that the person’s circumstances provide an acceptable or satisfactory reason warranting that conduct. This is a subjective test based on the circumstances of the particular case and will include considering the personal perspective of the debtor and what they considered when deciding how to act, or not act, in particular circumstances.

The debtor is not required to 'justify' how the circumstances impacted their decision-making or conduct. There is no burden on the debtor to justify their state of mind.

Example:

A person makes a false statement to Services Australia because they feared violence from their partner if they did not do so. An FA debt arises from this false statement. When considering waiving the debt on the basis of special circumstances, the person is not required to justify or prove to the decision maker their fear of violence, or the credibility of that fear. Services Australia only needs to consider whether the person’s actions were justified given their fear of violence.

Where the debtor or another person acted knowingly, Services Australia must separately consider whether the debtor’s conduct is justified in the circumstances and whether there are ‘special circumstances’ that make it desirable to waive the debt:

Consideration of whether the debtor’s conduct is justified in the circumstances requires consideration of the circumstances that resulted in the debt.

Consideration of whether there are special circumstances that make it desirable to waive the debt requires consideration of whether, based on any information about the debtor’s past and present circumstances that is available at the time the possible application of the waiver is being determined, there are special circumstances that make it desirable to waive the debt. The consideration of special circumstances may involve consideration of circumstances that were not present at the time the debt arose or are not relevant to the cause of the debt.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

Factors historically considered when applying the special circumstances waiver

In

Secretary, Department of Social Security v Paul Raymond Hulls

(1991) 13 AAR 414, the Federal Court of Australia held that it is not possible to set out a complete list of the relevant factors to be taken into account in determining whether special circumstances exist. Each case must be considered on its own merits.

Factors that have historically been considered as part of broader determinations of whether special circumstances exist at the

ART

and Federal Court of Australia, and could be considered as part of determining whether a person’s conduct was justified in the circumstances, include, but are not limited to:

the person’s physical and mental health

the person’s decision-making capacity

the person’s financial circumstances, including any debts and pending expenses

the person’s living situation, including any experience of homelessness or housing insecurity

the person’s addiction or dependence on drugs, alcohol or gambling

the person’s obligations and responsibilities, including caring responsibilities

the presence of family and domestic violence, financial abuse or coercion

the impact of external events and factors, including emergencies and disasters, and

the impact of cultural and language barriers, or the specific involvement of nominees or third parties.

Administrative error by the Commonwealth, on its own, would not be considered special circumstances. Section 97 of the FA(Admin)Act is a specific waiver provision for debts attributable solely to an administrative error.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 97 Waiver of debt arising from error, section 101 Waiver in special circumstances

What evidence is required of a person’s circumstances

Services Australia should decide whether to apply a special circumstances waiver based on the evidence available and the circumstances of the individual case. This includes considering, where appropriate:

the debtor’s own statements and account of events

indicators and details on the debtor’s record, such as notes of previous contact with Services Australia, partnered status, income and assets, homelessness, mental health, or social worker involvement

contemporaneous evidence provided by the debtor, for example bank statements, insurance claims or police or court documents (such as a family safety intervention order)

verification of the debtor’s circumstances from other sources, for example support services, counsellors, doctors, accommodation providers or social workers, and

any other evidence that could assist in applying the special circumstances waiver.

Statements made by a debtor should generally be considered a truthful account of their circumstances, unless contradictory evidence is obtained. It may be appropriate for Services Australia to request additional evidence from the debtor to verify their circumstances in some instances, for example if:

the amount of debt being considered for possible waiver is particularly large

there is reason for Services Australia to doubt the truthfulness of the debtor’s account (for example, Services Australia is aware of contradictory evidence about the debtor’s circumstances), or

the circumstances of the debt or debtor warrant additional verification or evidence.

Requests for additional evidence of a debtor’s circumstances should consider the administrative impost of such a request, particularly if they relate to circumstances that occurred long ago. The debtor should not be required to re-provide evidence already evident from their customer record.

Where additional evidence is no longer available but Services Australia considers the debtor’s statement alone is insufficient, a Commonwealth statutory declaration observed by an approved witness outlining the circumstances in question can be considered sufficient evidence of those circumstances. Intentionally making a false statement in a statutory declaration carries a penalty of up to 4 years in prison.

Any notice of decision regarding the special circumstances waiver must include a summary of the evidence considered as part of the decision.

1.4.3.30 Duty to invite claims or volunteer information

Volunteering information

As a general principle, Centrelink has no duty to volunteer information in relation to social security entitlements (

1.1.S.70

). Generally, failure to provide such advice will not be treated as negligent.

Exception:

If there is a practice to provide such advice in certain circumstances and the person concerned was aware of, and relied on, the practice, this may amount to negligence.

Inviting claims

The question of negligence often arises if Centrelink fails to invite a person to claim a benefit. There is generally no negligence in these cases, as any action to advise individuals of their potential entitlements and invite a claim is entirely voluntary. Centrelink does not have an obligation to inform individuals of their potential entitlements.

In order for an individual to establish that Centrelink was negligent in not inviting them to lodge a claim, they need to show that Centrelink had a voluntary practice to invite claims in that instance and that the individual relied on that practice as a basis for their own actions. Also, even if the individual relied on this practice, they would have to show it was reasonable for them to rely on it without querying whether they were entitled to another payment.

Example:

Senua is 67 years old and recently had an

FTB

child come into her care. She makes a claim for FTB and it is granted. Based on her age, Senua is also potentially entitled to

Age

, but in order to access this payment she would need to submit a separate claim, as Centrelink does not have enough information on hand to establish that she would be eligible. A few years later, Senua claims and is granted Age and becomes aware that she would have been entitled to it at the same time she claimed FTB, but Centrelink did not invite her to claim at this time. Senua seeks compensation from Centrelink on the basis it did not make her aware of her potential entitlements. Compensation was not payable, as Centrelink did not have a duty of care to invite a claim for Age at the time of the FTB claim, nor did it have a voluntary process to invite Age claims where it had a suspicion an individual would be entitled, which Senua could have reasonably relied on.

3.5.2.20 CCS - recognised participation exemptions

Summary

Individuals (

1.1.I.90

) eligible for CCS and experiencing the following circumstances will receive an entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) to an increased hours result of 100 hours per fortnight without needing to report recognised participation:

Exemption applies in these circumstances

Considerations

Individual has a disability or impairment

Individuals with a disability or impairment (

1.1.D.80

) where the individual is unable to engage in recognised participation to any significant degree, or would be unable to adequately care for the child if the child did not attend sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) at an approved child care service.

Individual is temporarily outside Australia

Individuals who are living or travelling outside Australia (

1.1.A.10

).

This exemption can generally only apply for a maximum of 6 weeks. After 6 weeks outside Australia,

SSAct

portability (

1.1.P.90

) rules will generally apply and the individual's eligibility for

CCS

will be affected, noting extensions to the portability rules may be granted in certain circumstances.

This exemption is not time limited if it is the individual's partner (

1.1.P.30

) who is outside Australia.

JSP

,

YA

,

SpB

or

PP

, exempt from mutual obligation requirements

This exemption does not apply where income support recipients (

1.1.R.07

) have an exemption from their mutual obligations because the individual is a home educator, distance educator or because of the number of children for whom the individual is the principal carer or main supporter (large families).

This exemption also does not apply where income support recipients do not have a mutual obligation requirement attached to their payment as they are the primary care giver to one or more children under the age of 6 years.

Individual is in gaol or in psychiatric confinement because they have been charged with an offence

Gaol has the same meaning as the SSAct section 23(5). A person is in gaol if:

the person is being lawfully detained (in prison or elsewhere) while under sentence for conviction of an offence and not on release on parole or licence, or

the person is undergoing a period of custody pending trial or sentencing for an offence.

Individual receives a

CP

If the individual also receives

CA

under the SSAct, the CP exemption applies as this provides an increased hours result.

Individual provides constant care for an adult or child but they or the person they care for do not meet the income or assets tests for CP

Constant care is defined in the SS Guide (

1.1.C.310

) for the purposes of CP in the following way:

A carer is said to be providing constant care if they personally provide care on a daily basis for a 'significant period' during each day. The care may be active, supervisory or monitoring.

To provide care on a daily basis for a significant period, a carer should reasonably be expected to provide at least the equivalent of a normal working day in personal care, as the policy intent of providing CP is to recognise that the carer is not able to undertake substantial employment because of their caring responsibilities.

Individual or their partner is the grandparent or great-grandparent and principal carer of the child

Applies to grandparents and great-grandparents who are the principal carers of their grandchild/ren or great-grandchild/ren but do not receive an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) and therefore are not eligible to receive

ACCS

(grandparent).

The grandparent or great-grandparent is the principal carer of the child if they or their partner:

provide all or at least 65% of ongoing daily care for the child/ren, and

have substantial autonomy for the day‑to‑day decisions about the child/ren's care, welfare and development during the week in which entitlement is being determined.

Documentary evidence is required to establish that the individual or their partner is the principal carer and their relationship to the child/ren.

The exemption only applies in relation to the grandchild/ren and great-grandchild/ren for which the individual is the principal carer. Grandparents and great-grandparents wishing to access CCS for other grandchild/ren and great-grandchild/ren for whom they are not the principal carer, or for their own biological children, will need to undertake sufficient hours of recognised participation in order to receive a subsidised hours result of 100 hours, or qualify for one of the other exemptions.

5.2.2 Information required for instalment claims

Introduction

This section contains one topic that outlines the obligations of an individual (

1.1.I.90

) who claims

FTB

via instalments (

1.1.I.100

) to provide notification of any changes in circumstances that may affect their entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) to, or their rate of, FTB.

An individual must notify Centrelink of anything that happens or is likely to happen that would:

make them ineligible for FTB, or

reduce their FTB rate.

This includes a change of address, which must be notified within 14 days of the event.

This section covers information required in the following circumstances:

change in care arrangements, and

changes in income (

1.1.I.20

).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 7 How to claim, section 25 Obligation to notify change of circumstances, section 25A Secretary's power to approve a manner of notification

Policy reference:

FA Guide

5.2.1.10

Change of circumstances - general provisions,

5.2.1.20

Change of eligibility circumstances,

5.2.1.30

Change of rate circumstances

Change in care arrangements

Individuals must report any change in care arrangements for an FTB child, whether in relation to a change to a written care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

), or to arrangements that are based on a verbal agreement or an established pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

). If 2 or more individuals share the care of an FTB child, the notification of a change in the care arrangements by one individual may affect the FTB entitlement of the other carer. Once notified, Centrelink should contact each individual to confirm the change in care arrangements.

Explanation:

If one parent/carer reports a change in care arrangements and that change is confirmed by the other parent/carer, FTB entitlements should be reassessed from the date the change occurred. If one or more individuals disagree that a change has occurred or on the nature of the change, Centrelink must investigate further before FTB entitlements are reassessed.

Note:

An assessment of care that is determined by either Centrelink for FTB purposes or Child Support for child support purposes has the effect for the other program. This means that where a care assessment has been determined by Child Support for child support purposes, that care assessment is used by Centrelink to assess eligibility for, and the rate of, FTB. For individuals who receive FTB from Centrelink and also have a child support assessment, changes in care can be advised via either avenue.

3.12 SBP rate

Introduction

The rate of

SBP

is equal to the total of the following rates:

the higher rate of

NBS

NBU

, and

FTB

Part A bereavement payment (14 weeks of the FTB Part A maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13).

SBP is paid via a single lump sum.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 36 When an individual is eligible for SBP in normal circumstances, section 66 Amount of SBP, section 58AA NBU of FTB if NBS added into Part A rate, Schedule 1 Part 5 clause 35B Annualised rate of NBS, section 31 Continued eligibility for FTB if an FTB or regular care child dies, section 32 Eligibility for a single amount of FTB if an FTB or regular care child dies

Indexation

SBP is not indexed directly, but increases on 1 July each year due to the annual indexation of the NBS and NBU and FTB Part A under 13 rates.

FTB Part A - historical rates

Rate to be paid relates to eligibility

The rate of SBP is determined according to the rate that applies on the day the individual becomes eligible for SBP for the child. This means that the rate is the applicable rate on the day of the child's delivery, or such later date that the individual first becomes eligible for SBP.

Example:

Charlie has a stillborn child during the 2018-19 year. Charlie lodges a claim for SBP during the 2019-20 year and is granted SBP under the income test. As Charlie is eligible for SBP from the date of the stillborn child's delivery, the SBP rate paid is the 2018-19 rate.

2.1.1.90 Abducted, absent or missing child

Summary

If a person (

1.1.P.80

) takes a child away from the person who is legally responsible (

1.1.L.20

) for that child, or if a child leaves care or refuses to return to care, without the consent of the person who is legally responsible for them, the child can be considered to be an abducted, absent or missing child.

Explanation:

The child may have been removed from the home without their consent by a third party, or may have left or refuses to return of their own volition but be under age and living with someone who does not have legal responsibility for them, without their parent/carer's consent. The child's whereabouts may also be unknown.

This topic explains where payment of

FTB

, that is dependent on the provision of care for a child, may be continued during a qualifying period (

1.1.Q.10

) where a child has been abducted, or is absent without consent or missing, depending on whether:

the individual is legally responsible for the child

there is a parental relationship between the abductor and the child

there is a family law order (

1.1.F.10

) or registered parenting plan (

1.1.P.21

) in force for that child, and

the individual has taken reasonable steps to recover care of the child.

Situations where eligibility may be extended during the qualifying period

Eligibility for FTB may be extended for the original carer for any of the following situations, provided they are taking reasonable steps to regain care of the child:

The child is missing for any reason.

Example:

The child is abducted.

A family law order or registered parenting plan does not exist, and the child is living with another person who is not a parent.

Example:

The child has run away from the family home.

A family law order or registered parenting plan is not being complied with, and the child refuses to return to the other parent.

Example:

The child would prefer to stay with one parent and refuses to be in the care of the other parent.

Special circumstances where the qualifying period does not apply

If a child ceases to be in a person's care without their consent, Centrelink has the discretion to decide that the child immediately ceases to be an FTB child or regular care child of the person if there are special circumstances which support that outcome.

Immediate assistance

An individual reporting that their child has been abducted, is absent without consent or missing should be referred to the police and the Family Court for immediate assistance and advice. A social worker may also be able to offer support to the individual.

Continuation of FTB instalments

FTB can continue to be paid for up to 14 weeks if the individual is taking reasonable steps to have the child returned to their care.

Reasonable steps include:

notifying the police that the child is missing or has been taken from care without consent, or

taking out a recovery order through the court.

Individuals who claim either past period or instalment payments or both must provide evidence that reasonable steps have been taken to recover care of the child. Acceptable evidence includes:

documentation of police or court action, or

contact information for the other person's legal representative if legal action has not yet commenced.

Where possible, a copy of the documentation should be attached to the individual's request. Otherwise Centrelink must sight the evidence and document the details with the individual's request. If there is no documentation available, Centrelink should confirm that the individual has sought legal advice with a legal representative.

What is considered reasonable for a person will depend on the circumstances of the case. The person making the claim must take reasonable steps for the recovery of the child.

Example:

An unknown person abducts a child. The parent notifies the police that the child has been taken. FTB can be continued for 14 weeks beginning on the day the child ceases to be in the adult's care. However if the child has not been found and returned to the parent's care after 14 weeks, payment of FTB is cancelled.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 23 Effect of FTB child ceasing to be in individual's care without consent

Past period claim (

1.1.P.60

) lodged by original carer

Where an abduction has occurred during the period included in the claim, the individual must provide evidence of their attempt to recover care of the child.

Abductor claims FTB instalments

A parent always has legal responsibility for their child, unless it is taken away from them by an order of the Family Court. If a parent who still has legal responsibility for the child has taken the child away from the care of another person, it is considered to be a disputed care case rather than an abduction (

2.1.1.70

).

If a parent has had legal responsibility for a child taken away from them by the Family Court, it is usually because it is not in the best interests of the child to allow that parent to care for the child. In this situation, a claim for payment by a parent who abducted the child should be rejected.

If a claim is received from another person who may have abducted the child, a social worker should assess the child's situation and make a report on whether the individual is providing sufficient care for the child, and whether the child is at risk of harm.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.100

Child at risk of harm

Past period claim lodged by abductor

As for an instalment claim, it is unlikely that an abductor would be eligible for FTB for a past period. The claim must however be considered based on all information about the case that may be available, either from the individual or the original carer.

Release of information about the abductor

Details of a claim for payment made by an abductor must be referred to Centrelink Privacy and Access Information Team in

NSO

.

Explanation:

If the Australian Federal Police are investigating the child's whereabouts, it may be possible to release information in the public interest about the child and the individual to the police. This is only done by NSO staff.

Under no circumstances can information about the new individual be released to the losing carer. Normal privacy requirements apply for both the previous and new individual except for the release of information in the public interest.

3.11 NBS rate

Introduction

There are 2 rates of payment for

NBS

- a higher rate and a lower rate.

The higher rate of NBS is $2,052.05.

The lower rate of NBS is $685.23.

It is paid for a period of up to 13 weeks (or 91 days) at a higher rate for a first-born child or each child in a multiple birth, initial entrustment to care or initial adoption, and lower rate for subsequent children. Where eligible, the first instalment includes the

NBU

.

Annualising NBS

For the purposes of

FTB

Part A rate calculation, the NBS rate is annualised as follows:

NBS rate = (Higher or Lower NBS rate) × 365 ÷ 91

NBS is included in an individual's annual FTB Part A rate for a period of up to 91 days where eligibility criteria are met.

If an individual is eligible for at least one day of NBS and is not excluded under the legislative instrument, a NBU amount of $683.00 is also paid in respect of the first day of NBS eligibility.

Entitlement to NBS is assessed as part of an individual's FTB Part A claim. NBS is not payable to an individual where that individual receives

PLP

for the same child, see

1.2.18

.

Payment of NBS

NBS is payable under 3 categories:

parent

entrusted to care, and

adoption.

A child will attract the higher rate of NBS if the child is:

Parent category

the first child born alive to the birth parent, and/or

born during a multiple birth.

Entrustment to care category

the first child aged under one year that becomes entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner, and/or

a child aged under one year who is entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner as part of a multiple entrustment to care (that is, where 2 or more children aged under one year are entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner as part of the same process).

Adoption category

the first child that becomes entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner as part of an adoption process, and/or

entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner as part of a multiple adoption process (that is, where 2 or more children aged under one year are entrusted to the care of the individual or their partner as part of the same adoption process).

Otherwise, a child will attract the lower rate of payment.

The table below shows the applicable rate of NBS for children in each of the 3 categories above:

Other children either currently in care or previously in care

for an example of an FTB Part A calculation with NBS included.

NBS & infant death

Families who experience the loss of a subsequent child before the child's first birthday are entitled to receive the higher rate of NBS (subject to the income test) for the deceased child. This is in addition to the FTB bereavement payment (for a period of 14 weeks) from the day the child died.

A top-up amount (equivalent to the difference between the higher and lower rate of NBS) will be paid to families who previously received the lower rate of NBS before their child died.

The same rule applies in a subsequent entrustment to care or subsequent adoption where the child dies before their first birthday. Multiple births, entrustments to care that involve multiple children and adoptions that involve multiple children already attract the higher rate of NBS by default.

1.4.2 Privacy & confidentiality

Introduction

This topic explains the differences between confidentiality and privacy.

Confidentiality under

FA

law

The FA(Admin)Act sets out the circumstances in which protected information (

1.1.P.140

) can be obtained, recorded, disclosed and otherwise used. Services Australia staff can only deal with protected information in a manner consistent with the law.

'Protected information' is defined in the FA(Admin)Act to include information about a person that is or was held in the records of Services Australia.

Protected information can be obtained, recorded, used and disclosed for certain purposes as authorised under FA law.

It is a criminal offence to disclose protected information without authorisation. A breach of protected information is punishable by a maximum of 2 years imprisonment.

Explanation:

Confidentiality provisions govern the actions of all people accessing or using information covered by the FA(Admin)Act, including Services Australia staff.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

Part 6 Division 2—Confidentiality

Policy reference:

FA Guide

5.1.3

Protection of Information

Privacy law

The

Privacy Act 1988

(Privacy Act) governs the manner in which 'personal information' is handled by Commonwealth agencies and businesses. It also provides safeguards for the collection and use of

TFN

s.

Personal information is defined in the Privacy Act to mean information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

Services Australia is required to comply with the 13

Australian Privacy Principles

(APPs) contained in Schedule 1 of the Privacy Act, including those relating to the collection, storage, access, use and disclosure of personal information. The APPs are grouped as follows:

consideration of personal information privacy (APPs 1 and 2)

collection of personal information (APPs 3, 4 and 5)

dealing with personal information (APPs 6, 7, 8 and 9)

integrity of personal information (APPs 10 and 11), and

access to, and correction of, personal information (APPs 12 and 13).

Services Australia staff must comply with the APPs when dealing with personal information. Unauthorised collection, access, use or disclosure of personal information is a breach of the Privacy Act.

Explanation:

Privacy provisions govern the practices of Government agencies and businesses.

Privacy (Tax File Number Rule) 2015

The Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015

(TFN Rule), made under the Privacy Act section 17, regulates the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of individuals' TFN information.

A breach of the TFN Rule is an interference with privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner. Where a breach is very serious, the Information Commissioner may seek to impose a civil penalty.

As well as constituting a breach of the TFN Rule, unauthorised use or disclosure of TFNs can be an offence under the

Taxation Administration Act 1953

and attract penalties including imprisonment and monetary fines.

Services Australia is an authorised recipient of TFN information for the purposes set out in the FAAct and the FA(Admin)Act.

More information about privacy and the TFN Rule is available at the

OAIC's website

, and TFN queries or enquiries can be directed to the

4.2.4.10 Claim action 1 - proper claim not made

Is a letter required?

No.

What to do

Centrelink must advise the individual that they need to lodge a proper

FTB

claim in the form and manner required by the Secretary.

The date of lodgement of the proper FTB claim will be the date the original claim was made if the claim is returned within 14 days of the individual being advised of the need for a proper claim.

Consequences of not complying with the request

Failure of the individual to make a proper claim stops the claim from being effective (

1.1.E.10

).

The individual should be advised that an ineffective claim cannot be reinstated by any Centrelink action, and if they want to test their eligibility for FTB in the future they must lodge a new claim.

Record-keeping

An electronic or paper file record of this advice should be kept.

3.1.7.03 Maintenance income test ceiling

Summary

This topic outlines the

MIT

ceiling. It covers:

background

calculating the MIT ceiling

Method 1

Method 2, and

example - calculation of MIT ceiling.

Background

Child support (

1.1.C.20

) payments received by a payee for one or more children may only reduce the payee's

FTB

Part A to the base rate for the child support children. Child support income does not reduce a payee's FTB Part A entitlement for other children.

Calculating the MIT ceiling

Where there are child support children and non-child support children in a family, or a child support payee has 2 or more child support cases, a MIT ceiling (

1.1.M.22

) must first be determined. The maintenance income is then compared to the MIT ceiling and the lower of the 2 is used in the MIT calculation. The MIT ceiling calculation depends on whether the

ATI

is above or below the higher income free area (HIFA) (

1.1.H.10

).

Note:

The

ES

ceased on 20 March 2017 for new FTB recipients. However, eligible individuals and ACOs may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

Where an individual does not receive ES, the part of the formula which refers to ES is ignored.

Method 1

Where ATI is BELOW the HIFA, the MIT ceiling is calculated as follows:

[2 × (Above base standard amount for the income + Above base ES amount for the income +

RA

amount for the income)] +

MIFA

amount for the income.

Where maintenance income is being paid by ONLY ONE payer:

above base standard amount is the sum of the FTB Part A maximum rate less the FTB Part A base rate for all the individual's child support children, and

above base ES amount is the sum of the maximum rate ES less the base rate ES for all the individual's child support children, and

RA amount is the difference between the RA for all the children and the RA for the non-child support children, and

MIFA amount is the individual's MIFA, calculated depending on their status (

3.1.1.20

).

Where maintenance income is being paid by MORE THAN ONE payer:

above base standard amount is the sum of the FTB Part A maximum rate less the FTB Part A base rate for all the individual's child support children, and

above base ES amount is the sum of the maximum rate ES less the base rate ES for all the individual's child support children, and

RA is calculated using the formula (A ÷ B) × C

A = Difference between RA for all children and non-child support children

B = Total number of FTB children of whom either the individual or their partner is eligible to apply for maintenance income

C = Number of FTB children in respect of whom the individual or the individual's partner, is entitled to apply for maintenance income from that maintenance payer

the MIFA amount is calculated using the formula (A ÷ B) + C × D

A = Individual's no child MIFA amount, which is the individual's basic amount MIFA minus the individual's additional MIFA amount for one child (

3.1.7.10

)

B = Total number of maintenance payers in respect of whom either the individual, or individual's partner are entitled to apply for maintenance income

C = Number of FTB children in respect of whom the individual is entitled to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer, disregarding any FTB child whose FTB child rate does not exceed the base rate

D = Individual's additional MIFA amount for one child, depending on their status.

Method 2

Where ATI is ABOVE the HIFA, the MIT ceiling is calculated as follows:

2 × (maximum rate portion) + MIFA amount.

Where maintenance income is being paid by ONLY ONE payer, the maximum rate portion is the sum of:

Standard amount - the FTB Part A standard rate that applies for all the child support children for a case (maximum rate based on age or base rate where that is the maximum rate for a child)

NBS

amount - is the NBS paid for FTB children for whom the individual, or the individual's partner, is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

MBA

amount - MBA paid for FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

Supplement amount - the individual's FTB Part A supplement amount for the FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

ES - ES paid for FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

RA amount is the difference between the RA for all the children and the RA for the non-child support children, and

MIFA amount is the individual's MIFA, calculated depending on their status.

Where maintenance income is being paid by MORE THAN ONE payer, the maximum rate portion is the sum of:

Standard amount - the FTB Part A standard rate that applies for all the child support children for a case (maximum rate based on age or base rate where that is the maximum rate for a child)

NBS amount - the NBS paid for FTB children for whom the individual, or the individual's partner, is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

MBA amount - MBA paid for FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

Supplement amount - the individual's FTB Part supplement amount for the FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

ES amount - ES paid for FTB children for whom the individual is eligible to apply for maintenance income from the maintenance payer

RA amount - the difference between the RA for all the children and the RA for the non-child support children, and

MIFA amount - the individual's MIFA, calculated depending on their status.

Example - calculation of MIT ceiling

Stacey and Jim are married and have one child, aged 4. Stacey has 2 children, aged 8 and 10, from a previous relationship, for whom she is eligible to receive $16,000 maintenance income. The family's ATI is $80,000 for 2019-20. Because there is a mix of child support and non-child support children in the family, a MIT ceiling must be determined.

Stacey and Jim's family ATI is less than the higher income free area for their family ($98,988) so the Method 1 MIT ceiling calculation applies.

Above base standard rate = (2 × $4,854.50) − (2 × $1,558.55)

= $9,709.00 − $3,117.10

= $6,591.90

Above base ES rate = (2 × $91.25) − (2 × $36.50)

= $182.50 − $73.00

= $109.50

RA Amount - not applicable as they do not receive RA

MIFA amount = $1,653.45 + $551.15

= $2,204.60

Calculation:

= 2 × ($6,591.90 + $109.50) + $2,204.60

= $15,607.40

The MIT ceiling applies in the application of the MIT because the MIT ceiling ($15,607.40) is less than maintenance income ($16,000.00).

2.8.1.40 ACCS (child wellbeing) - determinations

Summary

This topic describes the circumstances in which an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) can apply for a determination (

1.1.D.78

) and covers:

circumstances where a provider applies for a determination

subsequent determinations

evidence to support determinations

evidence that a child is 'at risk' (

1.1.A.110

).

Circumstances where a provider applies for a determination

An approved provider may only apply for a determination to be made where giving a certificate (

1.1.C.15

) is prohibited through the 12 month rule (

1.1.T.51

). In most cases, where a child is at risk for some time, first a certificate will be given by the provider and then a determination/s will be made by Centrelink for as long as the child remains at risk.

When the approved provider has decided to apply for a determination, they can only do so when:

the individual or the approved provider meet the

ACCS

(child wellbeing) eligibility requirements in relation to a child

the child meets the definition of 'at risk of serious abuse or neglect'

the child has been given a certificate (

2.8.1.30

) previously for the same child service and the same approved provider for a total of 6 weeks in a 12-month period, and

the child care service has not exceeded any ACCS (child wellbeing) limit specified for that child care service.

Centrelink will assess the application and, if satisfied that the child is at risk, make an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CE Determination for ACCS (child wellbeing)

Subsequent determinations

There is no limit to the number of determinations that can be made for a child.

In some cases, the evidence submitted with the initial determination will be under 6 months old and can be resubmitted. Where the evidence is older than 6 months, the approved provider, with the assistance of the family or other carer, will need to provide current third party evidence before the current determination expires to enable Centrelink to make a subsequent determination while the current determination is still in effect.

When a subsequent determination has not been made before a determination has expired, the approved provider will need to submit a new application for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination. The provider may also need to give notice (

1.1.G.13

) again.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CE Determination for ACCS (child wellbeing)

Policy reference:

2.8.1.60

ACCS (child wellbeing) - giving notice

Evidence to support determinations

Third-party evidence must be provided as part of an application for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination and to support subsequent determinations.

A statutory declaration from the approved provider is acceptable to support the initial determination but only where third party evidence is not available.

Evidence should not be older than 6 months and must be in writing.

Any evidence provided must clearly identify the child it relates to; the name and contact details of the organisation giving that evidence and the date the evidence was given. Where appropriate for the type of evidence, it must include the first and last name of the person giving the evidence; the person's title and/or position in the organisation and be signed by the author.

Where the evidence is a case plan or similar, only relevant parts need to be provided.

Example:

Patrick's family is engaging with a case worker to help them with resolving family violence (

1.1.F.15

) issues. The case worker has drawn up a case plan that outlines the background and a strategy help the family. The approved provider uploads the cover page identifying the child and the page outlining the impact the family situation is having on Patrick. The impact described can be clearly linked to Patrick being at risk of abuse.

Where possible, the evidence should state the period of time that the child is expected to be at risk for.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CE Determination for ACCS (child wellbeing)

Evidence that a child is 'at risk'

The evidence provided to support an application for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination or a subsequent determination must allow Centrelink to determine if the child meets the definition of at risk of serious abuse or neglect in the CCSMinRules, Part 2 Division 2.

1.2.10 Energy supplement (ES) - description

Summary

From 1 July 2013, the rate of

FTB

(Part A and Part B) was increased to deliver assistance with carbon pricing. Carbon pricing was removed by the Government from 1 July 2014 however the support has remained in place to deliver assistance with household costs, including energy costs.

From 20 September 2014 the name changed to the

ES

and the payment ceased to be indexed.

ES ceased on 20 March 2017 and is not paid for new FTB recipients who commence payment on or after this date. However, eligible individuals and

ACO

s may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

An amount of ES is automatically added to an individual's maximum or base rate of FTB Part A and Part B before the FTB income and maintenance income tests are applied.

Claims

Individuals do not need to claim ES. ES is automatically available, for periods of eligibility before 20 March 2017, as part of an individual's fortnightly FTB payments or, if the individual chooses, on a quarterly basis. ES is paid as part of an individual's end of year entitlement if the individual claims their FTB as a lump sum.

ES ceases when FTB ceases

Where FTB entitlement ceases, ES entitlement will also cease. This means that if an FTB debt is raised against an individual or ACO who had no entitlement for a particular period, they would also have no entitlement to ES for the same period. Similarly, where a review results in an individual having less FTB entitlement than was previously paid, the FTB debt raised will also include an amount for ES.

Where FTB reconciliation results in an individual having lower or nil FTB entitlement for a particular year, ES will also be adjusted accordingly.

ES is non-taxable, and is not considered income for FA or income support purposes.

ES rate during temporary absence from Australia

ES is also only paid to an individual for the first 6 weeks of an absence from Australia (

1.1.A.10

), or in respect of an FTB child for the first 6 weeks of the child's absence unless an extension applies.

Act reference:

3.5.3 CCS - hourly rate caps

–Summary

The type of approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

) a family chooses to use is one of the factors that will determine a claimant's level of

CCS

.

This section includes:

hourly rate caps

child attending school

examples.

Hourly rate caps

The applicable percentage (

1.1.A.70

) of CCS families receive during the financial year is based on their estimated combined annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

). A family's applicable percentage is used in combination with the child care fees charged to calculate the amount of subsidy per hour each family is entitled to receive for their child's attendance at a session of care (

1.1.S.40

). This will be the applicable percentage of the actual fee charged, or of the relevant hourly rate cap (

1.1.H.20

) (whichever is lower).

Where a child care service charges a fee that is less than the hourly rate cap, families will receive their applicable percentage of the actual fee charged. Where a service charges a fee that is equal to or above the relevant rate cap, families will receive their applicable percentage of the hourly rate cap.

The hourly rate cap that applies to children attending

CBDC

and

OSHC

is determined by whether the child attends school.

The

FDC

hourly rate cap will apply to all children attending a family day care service, regardless of whether the child is school aged or not.

The hourly rate caps are:

Service type

Hourly rate cap (children below school age)

Hourly rate cap (school aged children)

CBDC

$14.63

$12.81

OSHC

$14.63

$12.81

FDC

$13.56

IHC

(per family)

$39.80

Note:

The hourly rate caps will be increased by the

CPI

at the commencement of each financial year. The figures in this topic relate to the 2025–26 financial year (to take effect on 7 July 2025 for CCS and ACCS purposes).

Child attending school

For the purpose of the hourly rate caps, a child is taken to attend school from the first day of scheduled physical attendance, and where any of the following apply:

the child has turned 6

the child attends the year of school before grade 1

the child attends primary or secondary school

the child is home schooled as recognised in the state or territory where the child resides

the child would be attending school (the year of school before grade 1, primary school or secondary school), except that the child is absent from school, or is on holidays.

Information about the child's school status will be declared by individuals at the time of making a claim (

1.1.C.27

). If circumstances change, for example, a child starts attending primary school, individuals are required to advise Centrelink of the change.

Examples

Example:

The Huang family is charged $100.00 per session for sessions of 10 hours duration for their 3 year old daughter's attendance at a CBDC service - that is, $10.00 per hour. As this is less than the hourly rate cap of $14.63 for a child below school age attending a CBDC service, their subsidy will be determined as a percentage of the actual fee charged - $10.00 per hour.

Example:

The Mahunta family is charged $154.00 per session for sessions of 10 hours duration for their 1 year old son's attendance at a CBDC service - that is, $15.40 per hour. Because this is more than the hourly rate cap of $14.63 for a child below school age attending a CBDC service, the family's subsidy will be determined as a percentage of the rate cap of $14.63.

3.1.7.21 Maintenance income - entitlement method

Summary

This topic outlines how the entitlement method (

1.1.E.35

) is utilised in the estimation and assessment of maintenance income for

FTB

Part A. It covers:

application of the entitlement method

retrospective child support assessments, and

effects of reconciliation.

Application of the entitlement method

The amount of maintenance income an individual should receive for the relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) is based on the child support assessment, or a court order.

The estimated amount of maintenance income for the financial year is annualised when applying the

MIT

(

3.1.7

). If the amount of the liability changes during the relevant period, the amount of maintenance is reassessed and applied for the remainder of the financial year, or until the end of the relevant period, whichever occurs first. Where a new entitlement amount is received during the year, the maintenance income amount used to affect FTB is apportioned.

Explanation:

This reduces the possibility of a debt being incurred at reconciliation.

Example:

Michelle is privately receiving a child support formula assessed amount of $4,000 a year from July to December. This assessed amount reduces to $3,000 from January. Services Australia assesses the $4,000 maintenance income received during the relevant period from July to December. Due to the change in assessment amounts from January the total maintenance for the financial year is:

184 days at $4,000 = $2,016.44, plus

181 days at $3,000 = $1,487.67.

This amounts to $3,504.11 for the financial year.

Therefore, $3,504.11 should be applied from January until the end of the financial year (assuming no further changes). Any arrears are worked out in the reconciliation process. From the beginning of the new financial year, the child support amount of $3,000 is used until a new child support assessment amount is received. Applying $3,504.11 from January reduces the likelihood of an overpayment at reconciliation, depending on any other circumstances affecting her rate for that period.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.7

Maintenance income test

Retrospective child support assessments

Where a child support assessment is retrospectively reassessed, changing the liability for a past period during the income year, the maintenance income estimate is revised and applied from the date of reassessment. No immediate debts or arrears will be raised or paid during the financial year. However, subsequent payments may be reduced through mandatory continuous adjustment (MCA) to offset a potential reconciliation debt.

Example:

Mary has an assessment of $2,000 from 1 July 2011. On 19 June 2012, the assessment is changed to $12,000 with a date of effect of 4 August 2011. This is received on 24 June 2012 and Mary has been paid up to 26 June 2012.

Following the reassessment, the estimated maintenance income is calculated as follows:

Period 1 is 1 July 2011 to 3 August 2011 (34 days): $2,000 ÷ 365 × 34 = $186.30

Period 2 is 4 August 2011 to 30 June 2012 (331 days): $12,000 ÷ 365 × 331 = $10,882.19

Total = period 1 ($186.30) + period 2 ($10,882.19) = $11,068.49.

$11,068.49 is the amount that would be applied from 4 August 2011 as this is the actual date that the assessment amount changed.

No immediate debts will be raised.

The MCA calculation will compare the new annualised maintenance income amount of $11,068.49 to the previously used amount of $2,000 to determine if MCA should be invoked to offset a potential reconciliation debt. As the new amount is higher and therefore the individual has an overpayment, MCA would apply.

At reconciliation, the amount of $11,068.49 would be applied to the whole financial year and the individual would potentially receive a debt as there were no pays left in the financial year to fully recover the potential overpayment.

Reconciliation

In agency collect cases, the estimated amount of maintenance used to assess an individual's entitlement to FTB Part A is reconciled against the actual amount of maintenance received after the end of the financial year. This may result in a recalculation of their FTB Part A rate for that year.

3.5.2 CCS - recognised participation

Introduction

The number of hours of approved care (

1.1.A.90

) an individual (

1.1.I.90

), is entitled to receive in a

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) is determined by the individual’s circumstances.

All CCS eligible individuals are entitled to subsidised hours result of 72 hours per fortnight, regardless of their participation.

All families caring for an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child will receive an increased hours result of 100 hours per fortnight for each Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander child in their care, regardless of their participation.

Families will be eligible to receive an increased hours result of 100 hours per fortnight if they have more than 48 hours of recognised participation per fortnight, or have an exemption.

This section contains information on recognised participation and the calculation of the subsidised hours result for CCS.

1.2.15 Rent assistance (RA) - description

Summary

RA

recognises the housing costs that low income families face in the private (i.e. non-government) rental market. RA is payable to eligible individuals for an

FTB

child (

2.1.1.10

) or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) who is also an RA child.

RA is not paid to individual's who pay rent to a government housing authority.

RA calculation

For the purposes of FTB, RA is included in calculating an individual's maximum rate of FTB Part A (

1.1.M.26

) when the rate is worked out using Method 1 or Method 3. Method 3 applies when an individual has a regular care child and no FTB children.

RA is not added to the base rate (or Method 2) of FTB Part A calculations.

The assessment of eligibility and rate of RA for FTB is contained in the FAAct. However the meaning of rent and the associated concepts are the same as under the SSAct.

RA rates

Current RA rates are available at topic

3.1.4.30

.

RA payment

RA is payable as part of an eligible individual's fortnightly FTB Part A instalment payment, or a lump sum payment where claim and reconciliation requirements are met.

2.2.3.10 NBS - specialist referrals

Summary

This section covers the following:

referrals to a social worker or specialist officer, and

purpose of referrals.

Referrals to a social worker or specialist officer

Young people aged 17 years or under who are eligible to receive

NBS

with their

FTB

claim must be referred to a social worker or specialist officer to discuss available services such as financial planning services,

FA

entitlements and parent support groups. Attendance at the referral session should be encouraged.

Individuals who are 17 years and over who are experiencing and/or are susceptible to any of the following issues should also be referred to a social worker or specialist officer (Indigenous Customer Service Officer or

MSO

) for a professional assessment regarding:

inexperience in handling large sums of money

situations where an individual may be subject to pressure to use the payment unwisely

history of experiencing domestic or family violence

history of difficulties in managing finances

situations where an individual may be vulnerable to exploitation

gambling problems

substance addiction

homelessness or a risk of becoming homeless

previously had or currently has a child subject to child protection

intellectual disability, or

mental illness.

Any other individual may request assistance or referral to a social worker or specialist officer.

Purpose of referrals

The purpose of the referral is to assess the individual's needs and their required level of support to provide the individual with more detailed and specific information about available services such as parent support groups, financial planning strategies and FA services and to enable a referral to other appropriate services as required.

1.1.M.65 Modified entitlement method (FTB)

Definition

Under the

MEM

, an individual's

FTB

Part A rate is determined using the estimated maintenance income worked out by applying the higher of the entitlement method and the disbursement method formula. The MEM applies where an individual has chosen the Child Support collection (

3.1.6.70

) method and where an individual:

has not elected to use the entitlement method (

3.1.7.21

) or disbursement method (

3.1.7.22

) and they are assessed using the entitlement method by default, or

has elected to use the entitlement method.

These changes compliment the

MIC

to take better account of child support arrears when calculating FTB entitlement.

Example:

Karim chooses to use the entitlement method and has an annual child support assessment of $1,500. He then starts collecting child support arrears owed for previous financial years (owed $4,000 in arrears).

The MEM activates to apply the disbursement method to take the arrears into account, decreasing Karim's ongoing rate of FTB. If the MEM was not applied, Karim would incur a reconciliation debt at the end of the entitlement year when the additional child support arrears he received are counted.

2.8.1.50 ACCS (child wellbeing) - deemed refusal

Summary

This topic describes the circumstances in which an

ACCS

(child wellbeing) determination application is considered a 'deemed refusal'.

Deemed refusal

A deemed refusal is triggered when the Secretary does not make a decision within 28 days from the day the application was made for an ACCS (child wellbeing) determination (

1.1.D.78

). The deemed refusal is a refusal of the application, that will trigger Services Australia to review the application. The approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) will be notified of the outcome of the review.

On review Services Australia may approve the application (that is, overturn the deemed refusal) or not approve the application (that is, the application is still refused). If the applicant disagrees with Services Australia's review decision they can exercise further appeal rights.

3.1.5 Maintenance action test for FTB Part A

Introduction

This section explains the key principles and concepts associated with the

MAT

including:

determining which stage of the

CSS

applies

reasonable maintenance action for Stage 1 and Stage 2 individuals

when it is unreasonable to require a person to take maintenance action (

1.1.M.10

1.4.3.20 Duty of care when giving advice or information

Giving advice or information

Duty of care with regard to advice involves the performance of duties to a reasonable standard of care. 'Reasonable' generally means a standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent public servant administering

FA

legislation consistent with sound administrative practices.

The consequences of incorrect advice are the same whether the advice is given orally or in writing, so the same degree of care must be taken. Care must be taken to ensure that oral advice is expressed clearly enough for the person to understand, taking into account any obvious educational and language barriers.

Advice or action outside Centrelink's area of expertise

People often ask Centrelink to provide information about other government departments or agencies. It is important to make the person aware that the enquiry is outside of Centrelink's expertise and although Centrelink will offer whatever assistance is possible, the person should make enquiries directly with the appropriate department or agency for authoritative advice or action.

Negligent advice

The question of whether negligence occurred depends on the particular facts of each case. Duty of care is not breached simply because advice is wrong. The duty is only to exercise reasonable care when giving advice. As a rule, carelessness will constitute a breach of duty of care.

A person will usually not be able to establish that they have suffered economic loss because of negligent advice if the person has acted on the response to a general enquiry they made.

4.3.1.10 FTB payment delivery choices

Summary

This topic outlines the payment options available for

FTB

. It covers:

payment options

payment of FTB advances

delivery choices for individuals who receive FTB by instalments

when a past period claim must be accompanied by an instalment claim, and

payment of FTB supplements may be conditional.

Payment options

If the claimant is …

Centrelink can pay FTB by …

an individual (

1.1.I.90

)

fortnightly instalments, or

a lump sum.

an

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

)

fortnightly instalments, or

a lump sum.

Note:

FTB lump sum claims will not be processed until the individual (and their partner if they have one) have lodged an income tax return for the relevant income year, or have notified Centrelink of their

ATI

if they are not required to lodge an income tax return.

If an individual lodges a combined claim for both a past period and instalments, both the lump sum payment and instalments of FTB are paid following determination of the claim.

A stand-alone claim for a past period is only effective (

1.1.E.10

) after the end of the relevant income year and can only be paid after the end of the income year.

An individual who receives FTB by instalments must provide their bank account details for the direct credit of FTB unless an exemption has been granted. If an exemption has been granted, FTB may be paid by other means. The FTB Part A and Part B supplements are not included in the instalment payments as these can only be paid as part of the reconciliation process.

Note:

Conditions apply to the payment of FTB Part A. Where a child does not meet the immunisation or health check requirements (

2.1.3

), the FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

).

Payment of FTB advances

A portion of FTB may also be paid as an FTB advance. When an individual receives an FTB advance, their ongoing FTB Part A rate is reduced to repay the advance (

1.2.8.10

).

FTB Payment Delivery Choices may be impacted by the receipt or repayment of an FTB advance.

FTB advance payments - details

Delivery choices for individuals who receive FTB by instalments

Generally, individuals who receive FTB by instalments can choose to receive their payments fortnightly through Centrelink or defer payment of some or all of their FTB until the end of the income year.

While

ES

aligns with FTB in many ways, individuals can elect to receive their ES payments quarterly (

4.3.1.25

). However, individuals who elect to receive their ES payment quarterly should be aware that a More Choice For Families (MCFF) deferral option may override their election to receive ES as a quarterly payment.

In order to help individuals reduce the chance of being overpaid FTB, a series of options to help families match payments to their circumstances are available under MCFF initiatives (

4.3.1.20

).

Mandatory continuous adjustment applies to individuals who receive FTB by instalments, where required. Individuals who provide an increased income estimate to Centrelink, or who have their income estimate or actual income automatically uplifted by Centrelink, will have their daily rate of FTB automatically adjusted for the remainder of the income year to avoid or reduce any projected FTB overpayment. Mandatory continuous adjustment also applies where an instalment claimant's estimate of maintenance income is increased during the income year.

Where an individual's rate of FTB is subject to continuous adjustment, any future increase or decrease in the individual's income estimate or estimate of maintenance income for that income year will require recalculation of the adjustment amount applied to their daily rate for the remainder of the income year, based on the revised income or maintenance income estimate.

Individuals who have an MCFF option in place can alter their payment delivery choice, but cannot use other MCFF options to increase fortnightly payments above an amount set by continuous adjustment.

Any payment deferred under an MCFF choice will be made following the reconciliation process if the individual remains entitled to the payment.

Note:

An individual's payment choice will remain in place until such time as the individual's circumstances are reassessed. If the individual chooses to revoke their selected payment choice, any arrears owing will not be paid until after reconciliation unless the individual can demonstrate financial hardship.

Mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB instalments

When a past period claim must be accompanied by an instalment claim

For an FTB claim for a past period to be effective, the claim must be accompanied by an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

) for FTB when the claim relates to either a past period:

in the same income year in which the claim is made and the claimant is eligible for FTB at the time the claim is made, or

in an income year prior to the income year in which the claim is made and the claimant and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) is receiving an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) both at the time the claim is made and at any time during the past period to which the claim relates.

Note:

The above conditions do not apply if the individual is no longer entitled to FTB payments based on an estimate (

6.4.3.70

) at the time that the past period claim is made, or if the individual is not entitled to FTB at the time that the past period claim is made, such as where they no longer have or do not expect to have a child in care.

Example:

Leanne’s child Danial re-enters Leanne’s care on 1 August 2023 and leaves their care again on 1 February 2024. Leanne makes a past-period claim for FTB for Danial on 20 February 2024. As Leanne is not eligible for FTB at the time the past-period claim is made, Leanne is not required to accompany the claim with an FTB instalment claim.

Example:

Penelope is paid

JSP

. In May 2024, Penelope makes a lump sum claim for FTB for their child Deloris for the 2022-23 year. As Penelope receives an income support payment and continues to have Deloris in their care, they must also apply for FTB by instalments at the time of their lump sum claim, otherwise their lump sum claim will be non-effective.

Example:

Sandra and Don have had their ongoing FTB entitlement removed due to the sunset clause under the prohibition of instalment payments policy. In April 2024 Sandra is granted

CP

and makes a lump sum claim for the 2022-23 year for FTB for their daughter. As Sandra has no ongoing entitlement to FTB due to the sunset clause, they cannot make an instalment claim. Sandra will need to lodge a lump sum claim at the end of each income year that they wish to be paid FTB, at least until their non-entitlement to FTB based on an income estimate has been resolved.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 10 Restrictions on claims for payment of FTB for a past period

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.4.3.70

Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to 3 or more non-lodger decisions

Payment of FTB supplements may be conditional

For individuals who are required to lodge a tax return, the FTB Part A and/or Part B supplement can only be paid after the end of the income year when all relevant tax returns and other income details are available. An individual (and their partner if they have one) who is not required to lodge a tax return needs to notify Centrelink of their ATI before any FTB supplements can be paid.

Additionally, if an individual's ATI (which includes the ATI of their partner, if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

The FTB supplements can only be paid to individuals. This means FTB supplements are not available to ACOs.

Note:

If an individual (and their partner if they have one) fail to lodge a tax return by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

), then they are no longer entitled to FTB for the relevant income year and any FTB paid for that year will be raised as a debt. This also applies where an individual and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return but they do not notify Centrelink of their ATI by the end of the lodgement year.

1.1.Q.10 Qualifying period (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, the maximum qualifying period is 14 weeks from the date that the individual loses care (

1.1.C.90

) of the child. The actual period that applies to an individual depends on the circumstances of the case.

The qualifying period is the period of time that begins on the date the child ceases to be in the individual's care, during which FTB continues to be paid to that individual, and ends at the earliest of the following:

the date the individual regains care of the child

the end of the 14-week period

the date the child comes into the care of the other parent (

1.1.P.10

), if there is no family law order or registered parenting plan (

1.1.P.21

) in place in relation to the child, or

the date a change of care is considered to have taken place when the individual fails to take reasonable steps to regain care of the child.

Special circumstances where the qualifying period does not apply

If a child ceases to be in an individual's care without their consent, the child may immediately cease to be an FTB child or regular care child of the individual in special circumstances. The change would result in the individual's eligibility for FTB or

CCS

for the child ceasing. It would also enable the individual who has actual care of the child to become eligible for

FA

payments for the child if they meet normal eligibility criteria.

6.4.2.10 Verification of adjusted taxable income

Summary

This topic outlines how actual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) is assessed when an income tax return is lodged by the individual and/or their partner, and when income tax returns are not lodged.

Actual ATI is required to determine the individual's family assistance entitlement for the purpose of reconciliation.

Verifying components of ATI

Where possible, the components of ATI will be verified by the

ATO

and Centrelink when the individual and/or their partner (if applicable) lodges their income tax return. This includes individuals and/or their partners who have a valid reason for not lodging a tax return but do so for reasons such as to recoup amounts of tax withheld from their income throughout the year.

If an individual and/or their partner is required to lodge a tax return, they must do so for reconciliation to occur.

Each agency will verify specific components of ATI according to the table below.

The amount of taxable pension or benefit paid by Centrelink is not compared to the ATO's assessment of taxable income due to an individual's capacity to reduce their assessable income by means such as offsetting business losses.

Verification where an income tax return is not lodged

The manner in which adjusted fringe benefits total, non-taxable pensions or benefits, target foreign income and

DCME

are verified is the same for all individuals.

However, in cases where the individual and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, the latest estimate of taxable income, adjusted fringe benefits total, tax exempt foreign employment income, and total net investment loss provided by the individual are used in reconciliation.

Writing-off a debt

An

FA

debt (

) may be written off if:

it is legally irrecoverable, or

the debtor has no capacity to repay the debt, or

the whereabouts of the debtor is unknown after all reasonable efforts to locate the debtor have been made, or

it is not considered cost effective to take action to recover the debt.

If a debt arises because of FA(Admin)Act section 28(2) or 28(6) (which deal with when income tax returns have not been lodged), an FA debt may be written off if:

the individual and their partner ceased to be members of the same couple after the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

)

the individual was required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year - an assessment is or has been made under the

Income Tax Assessment Act 1936

of the individual's taxable income for the relevant income year

in any case - the ex-partner was required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year but still had not done so by the time when the individual and their ex-partner ceased to be members of the same couple.

Tyrone has a debt to the Commonwealth. His debt has been written off because his whereabouts for the past 3 years were unknown. Tyrone then makes a claim for FA and provides a copy of his tax return from the previous financial year. The Secretary may take action to recover the amount that was previously written off.

1.2.8 FTB advance - description

Introduction

Individuals receiving

FTB

Part A by instalments can request an FTB advance payment. The amount of an advance payment is based on the individual's FTB Part A rate on the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

). FTB advances are repaid via a reduction of the individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate over the subsequent repayment period (

1.1.R.33

).

Options for requesting an advance

A request may be made for payment of an FTB advance at any time during the financial year. An individual may withdraw the request at any time for advances not yet paid.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 33 Request, section 34 Form of request, section 35 Request may be withdrawn or varied, section 35A Entitlement to FTB advance, section 35C Amount of FTB advance

How FTB advance is paid

FTB advance is paid as a lump sum by direct credit into an individual's bank account.

Effect of receipt of an advance

When a request is lodged for an FTB advance, the individual's entitlement to be paid an FTB advance will be assessed. If entitled, the advance will then be paid to the individual as described below, and the individual's FTB Part A rate is generally then reduced by the standard reduction (

1.1.S.105

) to repay the advance unless there is a variation (

1.2.8.20

) to the original repayment period (

1.1.O.30

).

Regular advance

A regular advance is available to individuals who receive FTB Part A by instalments. When a request for a regular advance is made, the individual may nominate their advance assessment day, which can either be the day the request is determined, or a day up to 182 days in the future. The advance assessment day for second and subsequent regular advances is the day after the end of the last 182 day interval. The first 182 day interval begins on the day the repayment period for the first regular advance began, and second and subsequent 182 day intervals begin on the day after the end of the last 182 day interval. Individuals are restricted to one regular advance at any one time, and regular advances continue to be issued until either the individual withdraws the request, or fails to satisfy the entitlement criteria on their advance assessment day. Regular advances are paid at the minimum advance amount (

1.1.M.55

).

The repayment period for an initial regular advance is 182 days and begins on the day after the end of the instalment period ending after the advance assessment day, or from the first day from which it is practicable to adjust the individual's FTB Part A rate due to the advance. The second and subsequent repayment periods begin on the day after the end of the last 182 day interval.

If, on the advance assessment day for a second or subsequent regular advance, the individual has failed to repay the last regular advance within the 182 day interval, or if reduced or suspended repayments (

1.2.8.20

) apply to an unrepaid one-off advance (including social security advances), the regular advance arrangement ceases, and the individual needs to re-apply and meet the entitlement criteria if they again wish to receive a regular advance.

Individuals who receive regular advance will still be able to apply for one-off advances where all other entitlement criteria (

2.7

) are met.

Number of advances

Individuals can receive multiple advance payments throughout the financial year, which can have concurrent repayment periods, as long as the total of the original balances of any advances not yet fully repaid does not exceed the individual's maximum amount (

1.1.M.25

). However, an individual can only have one regular advance at any one time (

1.2.8.10

) in addition to any other advance/s.

Example:

Boris requests a regular advance. The regular advance is granted and the reduction period is from 1 July to 29 December. Boris requests and is granted a one-off advance later in the year, and the reduction period is from 1 September to 27 February. During the overlapping period of 1 September to 29 December, Boris' FTB Part A is reduced by the daily reduction amount of both advances. Boris is not eligible for any further regular advances while their existing regular advance is still ongoing, but can receive further one-off advances up to their maximum amount.

2.6.2.10 CCS - eligibility for children aged 13 & under & attending secondary school or aged 14 or above

Summary

In most cases, for an individual (

1.1.I.90

) to be eligible for

CCS

, the child must be aged 13 and under and not attending secondary school. However, there are certain circumstances where older children may still be eligible for CCS.

These circumstances apply where the child is not able to be left at home unsupervised, and an adult is not able to provide suitable care in the circumstances. This can include:

children aged 13 and under who are attending secondary school, including children with a disability or medical condition (

1.1.C.25

)

children with a disability or medical condition aged 14 to 15 years, and

children with disability or medical condition aged 16, 17 or 18 years in exceptional circumstances.

General preconditions to eligibility

For CCS eligibility to be considered for these children, individuals must indicate their child cannot be left at home alone and there is no adult able to provide suitable care.

Where an individual is already eligible for CCS for a child starting secondary school, the individual can make a case for their child's eligibility to continue by updating their circumstances with Centrelink.

To do this, the individual seeking CCS eligibility for a child in one of these groups will need to include a Commonwealth statutory declaration addressing:

why the child cannot reasonably be left alone in the circumstances, and

that no one aged 18 years or above can provide suitable care in the circumstances.

For example, this could be because the family live in a remote location, the child has a low level of maturity, or the child's disability or medical condition means they are unable to be left at home unsupervised.

Additionally, where an individual has a child aged 15 and under with a disability or medical condition (where the child is an

NDIS

participant, or has or is undergoing assessment for a specified condition), when making a claim (

1.1.C.27

) or when updating circumstances, the individual will also need to indicate and provide evidence the child has a disability or medical condition (see evidentiary requirements for children aged 15 or under with a disability or medical condition below).

Exceptional circumstances for children aged 16, 17 or 18

Individuals with a child with a disability or medical condition aged 16, 17 or 18 will only be eligible for CCS in exceptional circumstances.

In these instances, including when a child with a disability or medical condition turns 16, individuals will need to make a case for the child's eligibility, or continued eligibility, to Centrelink. Individuals will need to provide a statutory declaration (see

General preconditions to eligibility

), and information about their case for the delegate at Centrelink to make a decision.

Individuals may also need to provide evidence of the child's disability or medical condition with their request (see evidentiary requirements for children aged 16, 17 or 18 below).

General evidentiary requirements for children with disability or medical condition

To meet the disability or medical requirements, children need to be an NDIS participant or have been diagnosed with or be undergoing assessment for a specified condition. The individual must be able to provide sufficient evidence at claim or when updating their circumstances to substantiate these claims.

Children with a disability or medical condition aged 15 & under

For children aged 15 or under with a disability or medical condition, the following table outlines whether the child is an NDIS participant and their current status regarding diagnosis or assessment.

Child's eligibility

Documents required

Child is an NDIS participant

If the child is an NDIS participant, to meet disability or medical requirements the individual only needs to provide the child's NDIS participant number.

Child has been diagnosed with or is undergoing assessment for a specified condition

If the child is not an NDIS participant but has been diagnosed with or is undergoing assessment for one of the conditions listed in:

Schedule 1 of the CCSMinRules, or

Part 2 of Schedule 3 of

Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination 2020

the documentary evidence must demonstrate the condition was diagnosed or is being assessed by a registered medical practitioner (

1.1.M.40

).

If the child is not an NDIS participant but has been diagnosed with or is undergoing assessment for one of the conditions listed in the CCSMinRules Schedule 2, the documentary evidence must demonstrate the condition was diagnosed or is being assessed by a registered psychologist.

The conditions listed in the CCSMinRules Schedule 2 are also listed in the CCSMinRules Schedule 1, meaning evidence will be accepted if the diagnosis or assessment is made by a registered medical practitioner or a registered psychologist.

If the child is undergoing assessment or the documentary evidence does not specify the child's condition is permanent, or likely to be permanent, the evidence must be dated within 24 months of the date the evidence is provided to Centrelink.

Children with a disability or medical condition aged 16,17 or 18

Regardless of whether or not they have previously been eligible for CCS for the child, individuals who wish to be eligible for CCS for a child aged 16, 17 or 18 must always provide a statutory declaration addressing:

why the child cannot reasonably be left alone in the circumstances, and

that no one aged 18 years or above is able to provide suitable care in the circumstances.

An 18-year-old would only be eligible where they are enrolled in child care and completing a year of school to allow the family to maintain existing care arrangements until the end of the school year.

For children aged 16,17 or 18 with a disability or medical condition, the following table outlines whether the child is an NDIS participant and their current status regarding diagnosis or assessment.

Child's eligibility

Documents required

Individuals already eligible for CCS for their child

If the individual was eligible for CCS for a child who is now turning 16 the individual may need to provide evidence of the child's disability or medical condition:

If the child's NDIS participant number has been provided or previously supplied evidence indicates the child's condition is permanent, or is likely to be permanent, no further evidence of the child's disability or medical condition needs to be provided.

If previously supplied evidence indicates the child's condition was not permanent or they were undergoing assessment for a condition, the individual must provide new evidence of the child's disability or medical condition, dated within 24 months of the date the evidence is provided to Centrelink.

If the individual has recently provided Centrelink with updated evidence, the individual does not need to provide new evidence of the child's disability or medical condition, as long this evidence is dated within 24 months when the individual makes the request for their child's continued eligibility for CCS.

Individuals not already eligible for CCS for their child

If the individual was not previously eligible for CCS for a child with a disability or medical condition who is turning 16, or aged 16, 17 or 18, they will need to provide evidence of their child's condition as per the disability or medical requirements set out earlier on this page.

Where a child is not an NDIS participant & does not have & is not being assessed for a specified condition

If a child has or is undergoing assessment for a disability or medical condition but is not an NDIS participant and does not have or is not being assessed by a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist for one of the specified conditions, the Secretary's delegate can make a determination that the child has a disability for the purposes of eligibility for CCS.

Evidentiary requirements

The individual will need to make a submission to Centrelink, and provide documentary evidence from a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist. The evidence must include the condition the child has been diagnosed with, or an explanation of the type of condition their child is undergoing assessment for (if a registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist has not been able to identify what condition the child may have).

If the registered medical practitioner or registered psychologist does not specify in the documentary evidence the condition is permanent, or likely to be permanent, the evidence must be dated within 24 months of the date the evidence is provided to Centrelink.

If the delegate is satisfied the child has a disability and makes a determination to this effect, the individual must also provide a statutory declaration as described above. If the child is aged 16, 17 or 18, the Secretary's delegate must have determined it is appropriate for the child to be eligible for CCS in exceptional circumstances.

Change of circumstances

If an individual's circumstances change they must update their circumstances as soon as practicable. For example, if a child no longer has a condition, or an assessment has resulted in a diagnosis, individuals must notify Centrelink, and provide updated evidence where applicable.

5.2.1.50 ACCS - change of circumstances

Summary

This topic explains the circumstances in which an individual (

1.1.I.90

) and approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) must notify Centrelink of a change of circumstances.

General provisions

An individual and approved provider receiving

ACCS

(

2.8

) is required to notify Centrelink as soon as possible when a change to their circumstances has occurred, or is likely to occur. This includes any changes that may affect their

CCS

eligibility (

1.1.E.17

) (

2.6.1

).

The requirements relating to an individual's ACCS eligibility or entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) is in addition to the requirement to notify of a change of circumstance for CCS.

In addition to the CCS requirements, an individual must notify Centrelink if something happens and as a result:

the individual may no longer be entitled to the type of ACCS they are receiving

the amount of subsidy the individual is to be paid, for the child, should change.

Where an individual believes that their circumstances would result in them receiving a different kind of ACCS, they are required to apply for that subsidy.

Where an individual is notifying a change circumstance that may result in a favourable outcome, such as an increase in subsidy, the individual may be required to provide additional evidence.

Where the individual is notifying a change of circumstance that may result in an unfavourable outcome, such as a decrease in subsidy, then new evidence will not be required.

Centrelink may review an individual's eligibility for any kind of ACCS at any time. An individual will be required to repay any amounts of ACCS owing if a change of circumstances is not notified, and penalties may apply if the requirement to notify of a change of circumstances as soon as practicable is contravened.

For when changes take effect, see

6.2

.

2.8.4.60 ACCS (transition to work) - evidentiary requirements

Summary

This topic outlines the evidentiary requirements for

ACCS

(transition to work). This topic covers:

study - proof of enrolment

study - proof of progression

work

training

job search

other programs.

An individual (

1.1.I.90

) applying for ACCS (transition to work) is required to provide proof of their activity, if they have not previously provided this proof to Centrelink. This includes proof of their job search activities, employment, enrolment in a course of education or study or training or another program to increase their employment prospects.

An individual undertaking activities to improve their employment prospects through Parent Pathways may satisfy the activity requirements for ACCS (transition to work). Only specific activities the parents are participating in will meet the activity requirements; Study, Work, Training, Job search and other programs for ACCS (transition to work). The activity evidence requirements must be met as outlined below.

Study - proof of enrolment

For study or training activities, proof of enrolment must be documentation from the educational institution confirming:

the individual's name

the name of the educational institution

course name and qualification level

start and end dates of the course

study load - full-time/part-time or percentage load.

Note:

Individuals studying with Open Universities Australia must provide the name of the educational institution they are registered with to complete a qualification level. If an individual is studying units only, they are required to provide evidence of the qualification they are studying towards, and that they are undertaking the equivalent of at least a 25% study load to meet the part-time study requirements. If they are unable to provide evidence they are studying towards a qualification, they are not eligible for ACCS (transition to work).

Study - proof of progression

An individual must provide official documentation from their course provider as evidence of their course progression if and when requested to meet the proof of progression requirement. Documentation may include:

academic transcripts of results

certificates of attainment

other official documentation, including letters from their course provider confirming completion of the course/modules, and that detail the course/modules that have been attempted/completed.

8.4 SIFS - grandfathering provisions

Summary

From 1 July 2017,

SIFS

is no longer available to new claimants. Grandfathering arrangements permit existing recipients who were entitled to SIFS on 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS, if they remain continuously eligible for the payment.

Those recipients will be grandfathered until the first day that they are no longer eligible for SIFS. For example, if they do not have a SIFS qualifying child, the family does not meet the income tests, the recipient and/or SIFS qualifying child is outside Australia for a period of more than 6 weeks regardless of when the period of absence began, or for other relevant reasons, their grandfathered status will end. Recipients must be continuously eligible and entitled to be paid SIFS each day since 30 June 2017 to remain grandfathered.

1.2.8.10 FTB advance payments - details

FTB

advances & deferral of FTB

An individual who has received an advance can, like other instalment individuals, choose to defer their FTB Part A. The legislative rate of FTB Part A for an individual with an advance arrangement in place is the ongoing instalment of FTB Part A payable after the advance reduction has been applied. This amount is deferred when the individual defers their FTB Part A.

If an individual with an arrangement to defer FTB Part A requests an FTB advance, the advance is to be paid as outlined above. This reduces the amount of FTB Part A that is deferred.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.3.1.20

FTB payment choices for instalment individuals

FTB advances & continuous adjustment

As entitlement to an FTB advance is based on legislative entitlement to FTB Part A before any subsequent variation determination, an individual whose FTB has been reduced by continuous adjustment will still be eligible for an advance if their legislative rate of FTB Part A (before the continuous adjustment and after any existing advance rate reductions) entitles them to the minimum advance amount (

1.1.M.55

). FTB Part A rate reductions following receipt of an FTB advance will be applied prior to any continuous adjustment of the individual's daily rate of FTB.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 31E Continuous adjustment of daily rate of FTB

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.3.1.30

Mandatory continuous adjustment of FTB instalments

FTB advances & prohibition of FTB based on an estimate/non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate

FTB advances are not available to individuals subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate (

6.4.3.40

). Similarly, an individual who has become non-entitled to FTB based on an estimate (

6.4.3.70

) is not entitled to an advance until such time that they become entitled to FTB Part A again.

If an individual's fortnightly rate is being reduced due to the receipt of an advance when they become subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate, the individual's FTB Part A entitlement will continue to be reduced as normal. This is because the individual retains legislative entitlement to FTB Part A during this period (similar to deferral of FTB above). In these circumstances the individual's legislative rate of FTB Part A will be less the advance rate reduction. No advance debt is raised. The individual cannot be granted an advance while they are subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate, but they can be repaying an advance paid previously. As long as an individual retains legislative entitlement to FTB Part A by instalments, the advance will be repaid from these instalments and an advance debt will not be raised. Where the prohibition of FTB based on an estimate is lifted, any FTB Part A top-up paid to the individual will be based on the individual's legislative rate as reduced by the advance repayment.

If an individual receives an advance and subsequently becomes non-entitled to FTB based on an estimate during the repayment period, an advance debt for the balance of the unrepaid portion of the advance will be raised as the individual has lost legislative entitlement to FTB Part A.

FTB advance debts

FTB advances & bereavement

Bereavement payments, whether taken as a lump-sum or instalments, may be subject to advance rate reductions. If an individual's only FTB child passes away and the individual elects to receive their bereavement payment by instalments, the individual's FTB Part A entitlement remains at the advance reduced rate throughout the bereavement period. If there is still an amount outstanding at the end of the bereavement period when payments cease, an advance debt is raised for the amount outstanding.

If an individual's only FTB child passes away and the individual elects to receive their bereavement payment as a lump-sum, the lump-sum is based on the individual's advance reduced rate of FTB Part A. Any outstanding amount after the lump-sum is paid is raised as an advance debt.

If an individual's FTB child dies and the individual has other surviving FTB children who attract ongoing entitlement to FTB Part A, an advance debt is not raised after the end of the bereavement period as any outstanding balance continues to be repaid from the individual's ongoing FTB Part A for the remaining child/ren. If the ongoing FTB Part A rate for the remaining child/ren before the advance reduction equals or exceeds the advance reduction amount during the bereavement period, any lump-sum bereavement payment is not affected by the advance repayments (that is, the advance continues to be repaid from the ongoing payments for the remaining child/ren, not the lump-sum). If the ongoing FTB Part A rate for the remaining children before the advance reduction is less than the advance reduction rate during the bereavement period, a portion of the advance will be repaid from any lump-sum bereavement payment (as the lump sum amount is based on the advance reduced rate of FTB Part A, and is lower than it would have been if there was no outstanding advance).

This means that the advance reduction is first applied to the ongoing payments for the surviving children, and any difference for the bereavement period only is then applied to the lump-sum. Once the bereavement period ceases, the advance reduction decreases to equal the ongoing FTB Part A rate before the advance reduction, and the repayment period will be extended accordingly.

However, the advance reduction applied during the bereavement period should not exceed the standard reduction (or if a different reduction amount was nominated, that nominated amount). This means that if:

an individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate for the remaining child/ren is less than the standard (or nominated) reduction amount

the remaining portion of the reduction is applied to the bereavement lump-sum, and

the individual's FTB Part A rate increases during the bereavement period, then the reduction applied to the ongoing FTB Part A payments will not increase during the bereavement period.

Example:

Carl and Janice have 2 children, Diana and Noah. They are receiving FTB Part A at a daily rate of $4.00 before any advance reduction, and are repaying an FTB advance at a reduction of $2.50 per day, making their daily rate $1.50. Diana passes away and Carl and Janice elect to receive their bereavement payment as a lump-sum. The ongoing FTB Part A rate for Noah is now $2.00 per day, and as this is less than the advance reduction amount of $2.50 per day, the difference ($0.50) is applied to the bereavement lump-sum, making the ongoing payments for Noah $0.00.

Due to a change in circumstances, the ongoing FTB Part A rate for Noah then increases during the bereavement period to $3.50 per day before any advance reduction ($1.50 per day after the advance reduction). However, the advance reduction applied to the ongoing payments will not increase as the daily reduction amount of $2.50 has already been applied between the ongoing payments ($2.00) and the bereavement lump-sum ($0.50) for the bereavement period. When the bereavement period ceases, the full advance reduction will be applied to the ongoing payments for Noah, reducing them from $3.50 to $1.00 per day.

However, if the total reduction from the ongoing payments and the lump-sum were less than the standard reduction and the individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate increases during the bereavement period, the advance reduction may also increase. In this situation, the reduction applied to the ongoing payments during the bereavement period may increase prospectively, so that the total reduction applied between the lump-sum and the ongoing payments does not exceed the standard reduction.

FA Guide

Calculating FTB bereavement payment

FTB advances & income management

One hundred per cent of FTB advances are subject to income management for individuals in any of the income management categories or advanced income management measures. An individual's reduced FTB instalment payment will then be subject to income management  or advanced income management according to the relevant percentage, meaning that advance rate reductions will be applied before any remaining FTB instalment payments are disbursed to the individual's financial institution and their income management account.

3.1.1.31 Shared care rate calculation

Summary

This topic provides an example of the shared care rate calculation for

FTB

Part A and FTB Part B where an individual shares the care of their FTB child with another individual who is not their partner.

Note:

From 1 July 2008, the term 'shared care' only applies where an individual has care of an FTB child between 35% and 65% of the relevant care period. An FTB shared care percentage will be used to work out an individual's FTB Part A rate. The FTB shared care percentage will be worked out as shown in the table below:

No. of nights care (annually)

Percentage of care

FTB shared care percentage

0 to 51

0% to less than 14%

Not eligible for FTB.

52 to 127

14% to less than 35%

Not eligible for child related components of FTB. Eligible for

RA

component and other government benefits.

128 to 175

35% to less than 48%

25% plus 2% for each percentage point over 35%.

Example:

If an individual has care of a child for 40% of the time, their FTB shared care percentage is calculated as follows:

25 + [(40 − 35) × 2] = 35%

176 to 189

48% to 52%

50%

190 to 237

More than 52% to 65%

51% plus 2% for each percentage point over 53%.

Example:

If an individual has care of a child for 60% of the time, their FTB shared care percentage is calculated as follows:

51 + [(60 − 53) × 2] = 65%

238 to 365

More than 65% to 100%

100%

The rate calculations are used to illustrate the principles of sharing a rate. See the references given below for more detailed information about applying the FTB income tests for FTB Part A Method 1 and Method 2 and FTB Part B.

Maintenance income test

Example - calculating shared care FTB rate

Hilary has 2 FTB children, Daniel aged 3, and Jessica aged 5. Hilary has full care of Jessica, and shares the care of Daniel with her ex-partner Matt. Her percentage of care for Daniel has been determined to be 58%. Hilary's

ATI

is $5,911, and her combined ATI with her current partner is $100,000.

The following tables show how to calculate Hilary's rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B. As Hilary's combined ATI is greater that the higher income free area, her rate of FTB Part A will be calculated using Method 2. However, as Step 3 of Method 2 requires a comparative adjusted Method 1 calculation, the Method 1 FTB child rates have also been calculated. The higher of the 2 rates calculated under adjusted Method 1 and Method 2 will be Hilary's rate.

Note:

This example uses relevant rates as at 1 July 2019.

FTB Part A rate

Step

Action

Amount

1

Determine the FTB child rate (

1.1.F.57

) for each child under Method 1 and Method 2.

Note:

This calculation uses maximum and base standard rates as at 1 July 2019.

Method 1 $4,854.50

Method 2 $1,558.55 each for Daniel and Jessica

2

Determine percentage of care for Daniel.

Hilary 58%; Matt 42%

3

Determine FTB shared care percentages.

Hilary 61%; Matt 39%

4

Multiply the rate for Daniel by Hilary's FTB shared care percentage.

Method 1

$4,854.50 × 61% = $2,961.25

Method 2

$1,558.55 × 61% = $950.72

5

Add the FTB child rate for Jessica.

The result is Hilary's FTB Part A standard rate.

Method 1

$2,961.25 + $4,854.50 = $7,815.75

Method 2

$950.72 + $1,558.55 = $2,509.27

6

Determine the

ES

child rate (

3.1.1.25

) payable for each FTB child of the individual under Method 1 and Method 2.

Method 1 $91.25

Method 2 $36.50

7

Multiply the ES child rate for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for Daniel determined in Step 3.

The result is the shared care rate for the child payable to the individual.

Method 1

Hilary 61% for Daniel

$91.25 × 61% = $55.66

Jessica 100% = $91.25

Method 2

Hilary 61% for Daniel

$36.50 × 61% = $22.27

Jessica 100% = $36.50

8

Add the shared care rates payable for all FTB children for the individual. The result is Hilary's ES Part A standard rate.

Method 1 $146.91

Method 2 $58.77

Method 2 $2,568.04

13

Apply ATI test

Adjusted Method 1 (using 30% taper for income above the higher income free area)

Calculate income excess

Higher income free area less the income free area

$98,988.00 − $54,677.00 = $44,311.00

Reduction for ATI = 20% of the income excess

$44,311.00 × 20% = $8,862.20

ATI less the higher income free area

$100,000.00 - $98,988.00 = $1,012.00

Reduction for ATI = 30% of the income excess

$1,012.00 x 30% = $303.60

Income excess

$8,862.20 + $303.60 = $9,165.80

Income tested rate

$7,962.66 − $9,165.80 = nil

Method 2

Calculate income excess

ATI less the higher income free area

$100,000.00 − $98,988.00 = $1,012.00

Apply income reduction

$1,012.00.00 × 30% = $303.60

$2,568.04 − $303.60 = $2,264.44

Amount

1

Determine standard rate of FTB Part B payable for Jessica as if she was the only FTB child.

$2,883.50

2

Determine percentage of care for Daniel.

Hilary 58%; Matt 42%

3

Determine FTB shared care percentages.

Hilary 61%; Matt 39%

4

Determine the standard rate of FTB Part B payable for Daniel as if he was the only FTB child.

$4,128.15

5

Multiply the rate for Daniel by percentage of care = $4,128.15 × 61%

This is the shared standard rate of FTB Part B for Daniel.

$2,518.17

6

Compare the rate for Jessica to the shared rate for Daniel. The higher of the 2 rates is the standard rate payable.

Hilary's standard rate is the amount worked out for Jessica.

$2,883.50

7

Work out the ES Part B standard rate payable for each of the FTB children of the individual whose care is not shared (Jessica), as if they were an only child.

$51.10

8

Work out the ES Part B standard rate for each shared care child (Daniel) as if they were an only child.

$73.00

9

Multiply the result from Step 8 for each child by the FTB shared care percentage for that child (Daniel). If the individual is partnered, go to Step 10.

$73.00 × 61% = $44.53

10

Compare the results from Step 7 and Step 9. The highest rate payable for any of the FTB children is the individual's standard rate of ES Part B.

$51.10

11

Calculate the maximum FTB Part B rate by adding the FTB Part B supplement and the ES Part B amount from Step 10.

If the individual has at least one unshared FTB child, the rate of FTB Part B supplement is the FTB Part B gross supplement amount.

$2,883.50 + $372.30 + $51.10 = $3,306.90

12

Hilary is not a single parent, therefore the ATI test must be applied.

13

The FTB Part B income test is applied to the income of the secondary earner (

1.1.S.25

).

Income excess = ATI less the income free area

$5,911.00 − $5,694.00 = $217.00

Reduction for ATI = 20% of the income excess

$217.00 × 20% = $43.40

Income tested rate of FTB Part B

$3,306.90 − $43.40

$3,263.50

Hilary's total amount of FTB

= FTB Part A + FTB Part B

= $2,264.44 + $3,263.50

= $5,527.94

3.1.9.30 FTB Part B return to work

Introduction

This topic outlines the conditions to be met and the actions to be followed when an individual accesses the

FTB

Part B return to work measure (also known as 'quarantining'), in respect of FTB Part B entitlement.

Summary

Individuals who return to work (or start work) for the first time after the birth of a child or after a child comes into their care, may be entitled to the maximum rate of FTB Part B for the financial year period before they return to work provided they were not earning passive employment income (

1.1.P.55

) in that period. Eligibility for this extra assistance will be calculated after the end of the financial year when FTB payments are reconciled.

This extra assistance is only available for the lower income earner of the couple who returns to work for the first time after the birth of a child or a child entered their care. An individual returns to paid work if the individual is neither engaging in paid work, nor receiving passive employment income during that year and the individual later engaged in paid work for an average of at least 10 hours per week for 4 consecutive weeks that start during the financial year. Adoptive parents and other primary carers such as grandparents are able to access this measure for an eligible FTB Part B child provided a previous carer has not received this assistance.

Primary earner income limit

The FTB Part B return to work measure is subject to the primary earner income test.

If a secondary earner in a couple returns to paid work (or commences work) for the first time after the birth of a child or after a child comes into their care and the primary earners

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is more than the income limit, the family will not be eligible to receive FTB Part B for the entire income year in which he or she returns to work.

If the primary earner in a couple has an ATI at or below the income limit the return to work quarantining measure will operate for the income year in which the secondary earner returns to work.

Return to work objectives

The FTB Part B return to work measure ensures that an individual cannot incur an FTB Part B debt for the period in the financial year that the lower income earner is at home after the birth of a child or a child comes into their care and not on paid leave or receiving other employment related income.

Payment

Subject to the primary earner's ATI being at or below the income limit, payment of FTB Part B during the financial year will be based on the lower income earner's estimate of ATI.

The extra assistance available for the quarantine period is the maximum rate of FTB Part B payable for the period in the financial year that the lower income earner is at home and is not payable to eligible individuals until after the end of the financial year and after the reconciliation conditions are satisfied.

For eligible couples, if the primary earner's income is at or below the income limit, the quarantine period is free of the lower earner income test and therefore the maximum rate of FTB Part B is payable for that period regardless of the actual ATI of the lower earner for the financial year.

The FTB Part B lower income test applies to all other periods during the financial year (that is, before or after the quarantine period).

Accessing the FTB Part B return to work measure

Eligible individuals who meet the return to work definition, or who are making a voluntary nomination, will need to contact Centrelink to advise that they have returned to work.

If FTB is paid fortnightly, the individual has until the end of the first lodgement year following the relevant financial year (the entitlement year) to advise Centrelink of a return to work.

If FTB is claimed annually, the individual should advise of a return to work by completing the 'Claim for an annual lump sum payment of Family Tax Benefit Form' available through Centrelink.

Example:

An individual who returned to work in the 2012-13 financial year has until 30 June 2014 to complete their 2013 FTB claim and advise a return to work.

A lower income earner who was previously self-employed and is returning to self-employment will need to nominate a return to work by signing a written statement. This must contain their return to work details and be provided to Centrelink after the end of the financial year in which the return to work occurred.

Nominating a return to work of less than an average of 10 hours a week over 4 weeks must be provided in writing to Centrelink after the end of the financial year in which the return to work occurred. A nomination cannot be withdrawn once it is made. See also

'Nominating a return to work'

below.

The return to work measure only applies to the first time the lower income earner returns to paid work after the birth of a child or caring for a child that has come into their care. If the individual's taxable income from a previous financial year indicates that the individual may have worked since the birth of the child, then this will be investigated. Otherwise, the individual only needs to declare that this is the first time they have returned to work after having a baby or taking on the care of a child.

Note:

Single parent families are not entitled to this extra assistance as they already receive the maximum rate of FTB Part B.

Lower income earner

The lower income earner will usually be the member of the couple with the lower ATI calculated following reconciliation. An exception to this is to be made where the lower income earner (based on an original estimate of income) turns out to be the primary earner (based on actual income). This exception will only apply to situations where the lower income earner (based on an original estimate of income) has a return to work and the actual lower income earner (based on actual ATI) does not have a return to work within the same financial year. If both members of the couple have the same ATI, the lower income earner will be the member of the couple who returns to paid work first during the year. If both members of a couple have the same income and return to work on the same date, the individual should nominate which member of the couple the 'return to work' definition applies to.

Eligible child

The FTB Part B return to work measure applies to the child that most recently became an FTB child of the lower income earner. If all of the children became FTB children of the lower income earner at the same time the relevant child is the youngest FTB child of the lower income earner.

The FTB Part B return to work measure is only available once in relation to each child. If an individual does not return to work between the births of children, entitlement to access the measure does not accumulate.

Example:

Rachel gave birth to Sarah on 1 June and took leave from work to care for her at home. Over 2 years later, Rachel gave birth to Lewis on 1 September. Between the birth of Sarah and Lewis, Rachel did not return to work and therefore is no longer able to access the return to work measure for Sarah. If Rachel returns to work following the birth of Lewis then he will be considered the eligible child.

If the most recent child to enter care has previously been in and out of the care of the individual, the date they first became an FTB child of the individual is considered to be the original date the child entered the care of the individual and not the most recent date.

Precluded child

A precluded child is a child for whom an individual has already received the benefit of the return to work measure. This generally prevents 2 individual parties receiving quarantining in respect of the same child.

Exceptions:

There are exceptions to the 'precluded child' rule for:

shared care situations where the individual parties both qualify by returning to work

both members of a couple in a blended family who are eligible for FTB for the children in the same period

separated members of a couple who are both eligible for FTB for the period before separation, or

members of a couple who have agreed to swap who claims FTB with the result that both receive payment of FTB at different times during a financial year.

When a lower income earner returns to work for the youngest or most recent child, it would also be a return to work for any other children in care and the other children cannot have a separate quarantine period claimed against them for a subsequent return to work by that lower income earner. However, if one of the other children moves into the care of a different individual, they are not considered precluded and can be used to claim a quarantine period.

Quarantine period

The start date of the quarantine period is the later of:

1 July of the financial year in which the return to work occurs

the day after ceasing work, or

the day after the period relating to paid leave or other employment related income ceases (passive employment income).

The end date of this period is the day before returning to work.

Example:

Lucy gave birth to Sam on 20 June. Lucy receives 3 months paid maternity leave, which ends on 31 August of that year. Lucy takes no other paid leave. Lucy returns to her old employment on 1 March the following year.

The start of the period is 1 September following the end of her paid maternity leave.

The end of the period is 28 February the following year because Lucy returns to work on 1 March.

Lucy can be paid FTB Part B at the maximum rate from 1 September, after the end of her maternity leave, to 28 February the following year.

However, if Lucy decides to take paid recreation leave later in the year because she is going overseas and claims paid leave for the period (15 to 29 September) then she will not be able to quarantine her FTB Part B payments for this period of leave. Except for the days of paid leave, Lucy would still receive FTB Part B at the maximum rate for the period from 1 September to 28 February.

Leave at half pay

As stated above, a 'quarantine period' commences the day after any period relating to paid leave ends. This is the case whether the individual chooses to take their leave at full pay, or half pay.

Example:

Liz commences maternity leave on 4 August 2012. She chooses to take her 14 weeks full pay maternity leave at half pay over 28 weeks (that is, her maternity leave ends on 16 February 2013). Liz decides to go back to her employment on 2 March 2013.

The start of the quarantine period is 17 February 2013, following the end of her maternity leave on 16 February 2013.

The end of the quarantine period is 1 March 2013, because she chooses to return to work on 2 March 2013.

Liz can be paid FTB Part B at the maximum rate from 17 February 2013, after the end of her maternity leave, to 1 March 2013.

Return to work

A lower income earner is considered to have returned to work (or started work) if the lower income earner has an average of at least 10 hours per week of paid work over 4 consecutive weeks that start in that financial year. The return to work date is the first day that the individual's work level reaches an average of at least 10 hours per week.

Paid work is defined as any work for financial gain or any other reward.

Example:

Lucy gave birth to Sam on 20 June. Lucy returns to her previous employment on Wednesday 1 March. She works 3 hours on 3 days that week (9 hours). The following 3 weeks she works for 4 days per week for 3 hours (12 hours).

Lucy has worked an average of 11.25 hours per week in the 4-week period starting 1 March and is therefore taken to have returned to work on 1 March during that financial year.

Example:

Pam gave birth to Rachel on 20 June and returns to her previous employment on 1 March the following year. She works 14 hours during that week. For the next 2 weeks, Pam works 14 hours per week but in the fourth week because it is the school holidays she does not work at all.

Pam has worked an average of 10.5 hours per week over 4 consecutive weeks and is therefore taken to have returned to work on 1 March during that financial year.

Nominating a return to work

If the lower income earner has returned to work (or started work), for less than 10 hours per week over a 4-week period, the individual can choose to nominate that they have returned to work. In these cases the return-to-work date is the first date worked. Return to work nominations must be provided to Centrelink in writing after the end of the financial year in which the return to work occurred. The nomination can only be made after the end of the relevant financial year, as it is only then that it will be known that the 10 hours return to work rule has been met. The individual should be advised that nominations must be provided in writing and that the nomination cannot be withdrawn after it is made.

If FTB is paid fortnightly, a return to work nomination must be made by the end of the lodgement year following the financial year in which the return to work occurred. There is no capacity to extend this notification period.

If FTB is claimed annually, a return to work nomination must be provided with the FTB claim, it cannot be provided separately.

Generally, the individual must make the nomination. If both members of a couple were eligible for FTB in the period before engaging in paid work both must nominate if they are still together, so as to ensure that they both agree. If they have separated, the lower income earner must nominate.

Shared care

If more than one individual fulfils the return to work criteria for a particular child both parties can access the extra assistance if they meet other eligibility conditions.

This includes cases covered by a determination under section 28 or section 29 of the FAAct. This could apply in situations where:

members of a couple in a blended family may be eligible for FTB for children in the same period

separated members of a couple are both eligible for FTB for the period before separation, or

members of a couple have agreed to swap who claims FTB with the result that both receive payment of FTB at different times during a financial year.

Multiple partners

Where an individual has had 2 or more partners over a financial year and more than one lower income earner returns to work in respect of a child, the FTB Part B quarantine will be limited to the lower income earner whose quarantine period begins first. If an individual has had 2 separate partners during the period before she or he returned to work, and was the lower income earner with respect to one partner and not the other, the FTB Part B quarantine applies only to the period where the individual was the lower income earner.

Example:

Mary receives FTB for her one child and was partnered to Bob during July to October, single in November to December and partnered to Greg during January to June. Mary was the lower income earner in July to October and returned to work for the first time on 1 May. Greg was the lower income earner in January to June and returned to work for the first time on 1 February. The potential FTB Part B quarantine period for Mary's return to work is 1 July to 31 October. The potential FTB Part B quarantine period for Greg's return to work is 1 January to 31 January. Therefore, Mary's return to work will attract the FTB Part B quarantine period for 1 July to 31 October. No quarantine will apply for Greg's return to work.

The issue above involves a change in lower income earner status in the same financial year due to multiple partners.

Swapping roles in a couple

A related issue is where the lower income earner status swaps in a couple in different years, but the individual receiving FTB remains the same.

Example:

A lower income earner returns to work for the first time in one financial year. Their partner is the lower income earner in a subsequent financial year and the partner returns to work for the first time in that financial year. The intent is that the partner's return to work does not also attract the FTB Part B quarantine for the same child.

Self-employment & passive employment income

If the lower income earner stops working as self-employed in a joint venture with their partner and derives income from an interest or investments held in the venture, then paragraph (c) of the definition of passive employment income (FAAct section 3) is met.

Example:

Karen and John are self-employed full-time in their own business. Karen stopped work to have a baby but still receives a dividend from the business. Karen is therefore receiving passive employment income.

If the lower income earner has never worked as self-employed in a joint venture with their partner and derives income from an interest or investments held in the venture then paragraph (c) of the definition of passive employment income is not met.

Example:

Jillian and Joseph are partners in a business. Joseph works in the business but Jillian has never worked in the business. Jillian receives a dividend but because she has never been employed in the business, it is not passive employment income.

1.1.C.90 Care (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of being considered an

FTB

child,

FA

legislation refers to being in the care of an adult. Reference is also made to legal responsibility for the day-to-day care, welfare and development of the individual.

Care generally includes physical care, however, the importance of physical care decreases as the child (also refers to a young person) becomes older. For example, a baby or toddler's care needs are largely immediate and physical (feeding, nappy changing, bathing, supervision). As the child grows older, they will gradually start to meet many of their physical care needs themselves.

Care also includes mental, moral and emotional support including love, comfort and discipline. Schooling is essential for the child's mental development and attention to matters like healthy activities is also an important aspect of care. This means that the adult must maintain a measure of oversight with a view to protection and guidance of the child.

Some examples of care include:

having control of the child, including making major decisions relating to who the child spends time with and the child's health, education, discipline, recreational and/or social activities

having major daily responsibility for caring for the child and making the major decisions (for example, meal preparation, hygiene, transport, discipline, emotional and moral support and guidance)

bearing the costs of the child's daily life (for example, food, accommodation, transport, clothing, schools fees, health and dental care)

making arrangements related to the child's needs (for example, appointments at school or with doctors or dentists and accompanying them on those appointments), and/or

being the main person for the day care, school, or college to contact in emergencies.

When assessing levels of 'care' consideration of the full circumstances of each case must be taken into account to decide whether care remains with a parent, is shared with others, or is not present.

Older children living away from home

It may be difficult to determine whether a child (aged 16 years or older) who is living away from home is in the care of an individual for FTB purposes. This is particularly the case for a child aged 18 years or older because their parent/s or legal guardian/s have ceased to have legal responsibility for them.

Generally, an older child living away from home is providing for many of their own care needs, including making decisions about who they spend their time with, daily activities, schooling and health issues, as well as meeting their own day-to-day needs (such as meal preparation, hygiene, transport, socialising).

Provision of substantial financial support by an individual to a child is a key indicator that they are in the care of the individual. The financial support can be in relation to daily costs such as food, accommodation and transport, and/or in relation to longer term costs such as school fees, paying for airfares home for holidays, clothing and health and dental care.

In cases where the financial support provided is limited, consideration should also be given to other factors that suggest that the individual's involvement with the child could still be considered as providing care for the child. For example, evidence that the individual is actively involved in major decisions relating to the child's health, schooling and relationships and/or career development would strengthen the case that the child is in the care of the individual.

3.2.5 Total net investment loss

Summary

This topic explains the concept and assessment of a 'total net investment loss' (

1.1.T.53

) as a component of

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the

FTB

,

CCS

and

SBP

income tests. Total net investment loss is made up of both

NFIL

and

NRPL

. This topic covers the following:

net financial investment loss

net rental property loss

assessing NRPL - partnerships and trusts

assessing NRPL - members of a couple

assessing NRPL - multiple properties, and

calculating ATI where 'taxable income or loss' figure on the income tax return is a negative figure.

Assessing NFIL - general

For

FA

purposes, 'financial investment' includes the following:

a share in a company

an interest in a managed investment scheme (within the meaning of the

Corporations Act 2001

)

a forestry interest in a forestry managed investment scheme

a right or option in respect of an investment referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)

an investment of a like nature to any of those referred to in paragraphs (a) to (d).

The income and taxation legislation allows a NFIL in the calculation of a person's taxable income. NFIL is the amount by which allowable deductions in respect of the financial investment/s exceed gross income from those investment/s. For example, a NFIL would include the amount by which deductible interest expenses on a loan taken out to buy shares exceeds the dividend income from those shares.

Deductions a person may claim for an investment include, but are not limited to, expenses the individual pays to:

borrow money to make an investment purchase

manage their investments

obtain advice relating to changes in the mix of their investments.

Note:

A NFIL does not include any capital gains or losses, such as when a parcel of shares is sold for less than the cost of their acquisition. A NFIL is simply the amount by which a person's income tax deductions exceed the income they obtain from those financial investments.

Example:

Gerard has a share portfolio. Gerard's dividend income for the financial year is $7,000 and he can claim interest expenses of $10,000. Gerard also sold some of his shares during the financial year and made a $20,000 capital loss. Gerard's NFIL is the amount by which the deductions he can claim on his shares exceed the income he receives from them. In calculating his NFIL Gerard's capital loss is not taken into account. This means Gerard's NFIL is $3,000.

Although NFIL is deductible for taxation purposes, NFIL is required to be added back as a component of an individual's ATI in determining eligibility for FTB, CCS and SBP.

Example:

In the last financial year, Simon has a salary income of $100,000. Simon also invested in shares and made a NFIL of $5,000. The

ATO

assessed his taxable income for the year as $95,000. For FA purposes however, Simon's income will be $100,000.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 Adjusted taxable income

Assessing NRPL - general

The income taxation legislation allows a NRPL in the calculation of a person's taxable income. For FTB, CCS and SBP purposes, NRPL is added back to the person's taxable income as part of their ATI.

Example:

Jane made a NRPL on a rental property of $5,000. The ATO assessed her taxable income as $25,000. For FA purposes, the $5,000 will be added back to Jane's taxable income; her ATI will be $30,000.

For the purposes of the SBP income test, only the amount of the NRPL that has been incurred in the relevant 6 month income test period is included. For further details on how the income test period is defined for SBP see

4.15.1

.

The amount of NRPL that an individual, and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

), receives from rental property is assessed for ATI. This applies to residential and commercial land and buildings, regardless of:

the nature of the ownership, or

Example:

The person may be an owner, mortgagee, lessee or lessor.

whether the income results from a property investment or not.

Explanation:

If part of a person's principal home is rented out, any NRPL will be assessed as well as any NRPL a person has from investment properties.

NRPL does not apply to personal property such as cars.

FA Guide

2.12.1

SBP eligibility criteria

NRPL - partnerships & trusts

Generally, co-owners (that is, tenants-in-common) of rental properties, such as a husband and wife, are regarded as investors who are not carrying on a business. However, for tax purposes they are deemed to be a (tax law) partnership, but do not lodge a partnership return as they are not in a (general law) partnership carrying on a business. In this situation, each co-owner will need to include their share of rent and expenses in their individual income tax returns, based on their legal interest in the property. Any NRPL is shown in the individual tax return and is added back in the calculation of ATI.

If a partnership is carrying on a rental property business, any NRPL will be reflected in the partners' individual tax return as a net non-primary production distribution loss. This also applies to a partnership carrying on a business but which owns a rental property. The NRPL is added back in the calculation of ATI. A general law partnership means income from a partnership which is declared to the ATO as partnership income. If a person and their partner jointly own a rental property, this is not regarded as being a general law partnership unless the income from the property is correctly reported to the ATO as partnership income.

A NRPL made by a trust cannot be distributed to individual beneficiaries. A trust loss must be quarantined in the trust and can only be carried forward to offset against the trust's income in future years. There is nothing to add back in this instance in the calculation of ATI.

Assessing NRPL - members of a couple

An individual's and their partner's ATI is calculated separately, before being combined.

Example:

An individual and their partner provide the following income details:

Income details

Individual ($)

The combined ATI of the couple is $4,000 + $33,000 = $37,000.

Assessing NRPL - multiple properties

If a person has more than one rental property and there is a combination of losses and gains, these are offset and the NRPL provisions apply only if there is an overall NRPL.

Example:

A person has 2 rental properties, one made a profit of $3,000 and the other made a loss of $4,000. In this case, the gain of $3,000 is offset against the loss of $4,000 giving a NRPL of $1,000. This $1,000 would be the loss declared to the ATO and is the amount that would be assessed as the NRPL for ATI purposes.

Calculating ATI where the 'taxable income or loss' figure on the income tax return is a negative figure

If a person's taxable income or loss is calculated to be a negative value, it is taken to be zero, before adding the NRPL and other income components for the purposes of calculating ATI.

Explanation:

A component of ATI is 'taxable income'. The definition of taxable income provides a methodology where taxable income cannot be less than NIL. Consequently, though taxation legislation allows for a tax loss to be carried forward to the next income year, nevertheless a tax loss is treated as NIL taxable income for ATI purposes.

Example:

A person provides the following estimate of their income:

Income details

Estimate ($)

Income from wages

10,000

Loss from rental property

15,000

Taxable income or loss

(5,000)

The taxable income for ATI purposes is taken to be zero and the total net investment loss of $15,000 is added back in, resulting in an ATI of $15,000.

Note:

For the purposes of the SBP income test, the amount added back in this example would be only that amount for the loss incurred during the relevant 6 months income test period. This would be $7,500 if the loss was spread evenly throughout the income year and the 6 month income test period fell entirely within the income year.

6.4.3.70 Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to 3 or more non-lodger decisions

Summary

If an individual has 3 or more

FTB

non-lodger decisions (variations under FA(Admin)Act subsection 28(2) for an income year) because they and/or their partner (who is a 'relevant partner') did not lodge a required tax return for the relevant income year or notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner were not required to lodge an income tax return for that year, and for at least one of those decisions there is an FTB non-lodger debt that has not been fully repaid, the individual (and their partner, if applicable) will lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate.

Application of non-entitlement provision

Individuals with 3 or more non-lodger decisions with an associated outstanding debt lose entitlement to FTB payments based on an estimate.

All non-lodger decisions count towards the 3 non-lodger decisions leading to non-entitlement. These also include non-lodger decisions that do not have a non-lodger debt associated with them (for example, where the individual has paid the debt amount off in full, or they are entitled to, but on a zero rate of payment).

Once the non-lodger decisions are made, they remain on the individual's record and will always be counted for non-entitlement purposes.

Non-lodger decisions that arise solely due to an individual's ex-partner not lodging a tax return are not counted towards the 3 non-lodger decisions unless the individual and their ex-partner reconcile and become re-partnered at a later point in time.

The individual with 3 non-lodger decisions will lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate if they have an outstanding non-lodger debt associated with at least one of those decisions. If an individual loses entitlement to FTB, they will also lose entitlement to all components of FTB including

RA

. However, if the individual is also receiving income support, they may be entitled to RA paid with their income support payment.

Loss of entitlement to FTB will preclude the individual (and their partner, if applicable) from accessing ancillary benefits via FTB such as:

the lower threshold of the Extended Medicare Safety Net from the start of the following calendar year

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme

Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and

health care card.

However, some individuals may be able to access these benefits if they are eligible for certain income support payments or concession cards.

Example:

Iain does not lodge income tax returns for the income years 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14, nor do they notify Centrelink of their ATI because they are not required to lodge income tax returns for these years. For each of these years, a subsection 28(2) decision was made, determining that Iain was not entitled to any payment and a debt was raised for the monies under section 71.

When Centrelink raises the non-lodger debt for 2013-14, Iain will lose entitlement to FTB by fortnightly instalments, and all access to add-ons. Iain will only be able to regain entitlement to FTB by fortnightly instalments when they either:

lodge all of their outstanding income tax returns for the 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14 income years

notify Centrelink of their ATI because they are not required to lodge income tax returns for these years, or

repays all outstanding non-lodger debt amounts, and

lodges a new claim for FTB.

Iain's current partner Michelle will also lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate at the same time Iain does, and will have to meet the same requirements as Iain to be paid FTB by instalments whilst they are partnered.

Loss of entitlement to FTB will also preclude the individual (and their partner, if applicable) from accessing

SBP

under the FTB Part A eligibility test.

Past period lump sum payments

Individuals who are affected by the non-entitlement for FTB based on an estimate are able to re-claim FTB as fortnightly instalments if they lodge all outstanding income tax returns, notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge income tax returns for the relevant years or fully repay all their outstanding non-lodger debts.

These individuals are able to make a claim for payment of FTB based on actual income if they make a past period claim following the end of the relevant income year. The claimant's and their partner's (if applicable) actual income for the relevant income year must be known before the lump sum claim can be determined.

Example:

Vicky loses entitlement to payment of FTB based on an estimate due to having 3 non-lodger decisions as at 1 July 2015. In August 2016 Vicky lodges a past period claim for the 2015-16 income year, after they and their partner Jamie lodge their income tax returns for 2015-16. In September 2016 Centrelink receives confirmation of their ATI at which time Vicky's claim is determined and Vicky is paid their FTB entitlement for the 2015-16 income year as a lump sum.

Resumption of fortnightly payments

Individuals who lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate are able to receive FTB as fortnightly payments from the date their ATIs are confirmed for all outstanding non-lodger decisions or all non lodger debts are fully repaid. No arrears are payable for FTB not received in the current year-to-date until the individual's (and partner's if applicable) ATI is confirmed in the next income year.

Example:

As at 1 July 2015 Jeffrey has 3 non-lodger decisions for 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. They lodge their outstanding tax returns for 2010-11 and 2011-12 on 15 August 2015, and on 19 October 2015 they repay the final outstanding amount of their 2012-13 non-lodger debt. On 21 October 2015, Jeffrey lodges a new instalment claim, which includes a claim for the past period 1 July to 18 October 2015. Jeffrey's claim is successful and their instalment payments resume from 19 October 2015. However, they are not entitled to the arrears payment for the period 1 July to 18 October. The payment for this period will be made only after their (and their partner's, if applicable) ATI is confirmed in the next income year.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

Past period claims for individuals receiving income support

Individuals who receive FTB and income support payments and who lose entitlement to FTB based on an estimate are no longer required to make an instalment claim with their past period claim for FTB in order to be paid for the past period.

Example:

Joe lost entitlement to payment of FTB based on an estimate as they had 3 non-lodger decisions as at 1 July 2016. Joe and his partner Jill began receiving social security pensions in 2015-16 and they continue to receive income support payments in 2016-17. On 15 October 2016, Joe and Jill lodge their relevant income tax returns for 2015-16. On 20 December 2016 Joe makes an effective past period claim for 2015-16 without lodging an instalment claim for 2016-17. Joe's past period claim is accepted and they receive a lump sum payment for 2015-16. Joe is unable to lodge an instalment claim until all of their remaining non-lodger decisions are resolved.

Deferral of non-entitlement - special circumstances

Centrelink has the discretion to determine that the loss of entitlement to FTB on the basis of an estimate of income (which includes maintenance income) will not apply for a specified period where there are special circumstances. This would allow those with special circumstances to continue to receive fortnightly payments of FTB during the specified period.

As a general rule, special circumstances for non-entitlement to FTB would be expected to include the same circumstances as those for prohibition of FTB based on an estimate, where the individual is experiencing hardship due to:

domestic/family violence (

1.1.F.15

) (referral to a social worker or

ISO

is required) (up to 6 months)

severe financial hardship (up to 4 weeks), or

severe illness (up to 6 months).

Other circumstances may be considered as 'special circumstances' at the discretion of Centrelink.

Deferral due to special circumstances applies for a specified period and any continuation of the discretion would be subject to ongoing review.

Individuals would be expected to resolve their non-lodger circumstances by the end of the deferral period by lodging all outstanding income tax returns, or notifying Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge income tax returns, or paying all outstanding non-lodger debts. If they fail to do so and their special circumstances no longer apply, they will lose entitlement to FTB under the non-entitlement provision at the end of the deferral period.

In some circumstances Centrelink may determine that the discretion be backdated to apply from a day in the past, or it may be appropriate for the discretion to apply on or after the day Centrelink decides to exercise the discretion.

2.1.3.10 FTB immunisation requirements

Summary

Immunisation requirements described below apply to

FTB

children as per the age appropriate National Immunisation Program childhood schedule (birth to 4 years), for all children aged under 20 years. Where a child does not meet the immunisation requirements, the FTB child rate will be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

). The FTB child's immunisation status is assessed using the detailed rules against antigens and diseases required for an age-based schedule. Based on immunisation information forwarded to the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), an assessment is made to determine if an individual is due, not due or overdue for immunisation at any given point in time. If found to be overdue, they will remain as overdue and not meeting the FTB immunisation requirements until the requirements have been met.

Note:

From 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2015, immunisation requirements were assessed in the income years in which the FTB child turned 1, 2 and 5 years. For income years from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, where immunisation requirements are not met for a child who turned one in the relevant income year, and in each subsequent income year up to the end of the calendar year in which the child turns 19, an individual's FTB Part A end of year supplement was withheld, rather than the individual's FTB Part A child rate being reduced (

8.1.2

).

This topic discusses the following:

immunisation requirements for FTB Part A

immunisation requirements where an FTB child or individual claiming FTB dies, and

other classes of children who have been determined to meet immunisation requirements.

Immunisation requirements for FTB Part A

From 1 July 2018, where a child does not meet the immunisation requirements as per the National Immunisation Program childhood schedule (birth to 4 years), the FTB child rate will be reduced for each day during an FTB rate reduction period.

An FTB child meets the immunisation requirements if:

the child is immunised in accordance with the National Immunisation Program childhood schedule (birth to 4 years) or is on an approved catch-up vaccination schedule

the child has a medical contraindication

the child has natural immunity, or

the Secretary has determined that the child meets the immunisation requirements (

2.1.3.40

).

Notification that a child meets the immunisation requirements needs to be provided to the AIR by a recognised immunisation provider (

1.1.R.09

). Centrelink uses information held in the AIR to check whether immunisation requirements have been met. For FTB paid by instalment for a child, Centrelink must be notified before the end of a 63 day grace period. Where an individual claims FTB for a past period, that child must be meeting immunisation requirements at the time the claim is determined by Centrelink.

Act reference:

FAAct

Immunisation requirements where an FTB child or individual dies

If an FTB child dies, the immunisation requirements do not need to be met if the child dies before the end of the 63 day grace period or during an FTB rate reduction period.

If an individual receiving FTB dies, the individual's eligibility for FTB Part A will no longer be conditional on the FTB child meeting the immunisation requirements. However, the immunisation requirement may still apply to other individuals who are eligible for FTB Part A in relation to the child.

Other classes of children who meet the immunisation requirements are children who are:

participants in an approved vaccine study

unable to be vaccinated due to temporary unavailability of a vaccine

vaccinated overseas and have had a recognised immunisation provider certify that they acquired the same level of immunisation if the child had been vaccinated in Australia, or

the Secretary has determined that the child meets the immunisation requirements after considering decision-making principles set out in the

2.1.1.15 Verification of child's name & date of birth

Introduction

To make an effective claim for

FTB

by instalment, the individual must provide proof of birth documents. These can be provided electronically or in person to Centrelink.

DOB

of a newborn child

A claim for a newborn child must be accompanied by proof of the child's DOB.

Verification may be obtained from the child's birth certificate, a claim form signed by a doctor or midwife and sealed with the hospital seal, passport or other suitable documentation that verifies the child's DOB.

Example:

A letter from the doctor or midwife who attended the birth, including home births, confirming their details and qualifications, the details of the parent and child and the DOB and place of birth.

Name & DOB of an older child

Verification of an older child's name and DOB is required. The following records are considered acceptable for this purpose:

a birth certificate or certified extract

a passport or naturalisation certificate

a document of identity issued by the Department of Home Affairs, or

any other suitable documentation that verifies the child's name and DOB.

Example:

A statement from a

MSO

.

If FTB has been paid previously for a child, the previous guardian's record is sufficient proof of name and birth, as the previous guardian would already have proven these personal details. Where an individual later advises of a change to the child's name, accompanying proof may be required, as outlined in SS Guide

2.2.2

.

DOB of unaccompanied humanitarian minors (UHMs) & other children born overseas where DOB is unknown

In some situations, refugees and other children born overseas cannot verify their DOB.

For FTB purposes, with effect from 5 April 2004, the UHMs' DOB is the date detailed on documents issued by the Department of Home Affairs. The Department of Home Affairs uses an assumed DOB of 31/12/yyyy handwritten on the Department of Home Affairs document. The same DOB must also be recorded for FTB purposes.

The DOB of UHMs who have previously had their DOB recorded as 01/01/yyyy should retain this birth date.

DOB of children (other than UHMs) where DOB is unknown

For FTB purposes, the assumed DOB of these children (other than UHMs) whether born in Australia or overseas whose DOB is unknown, should continue to be recorded as 01/01/yyyy.

1.1.T.51 The 12 month rule (ACCS (child wellbeing))

Definition

An approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) cannot give more than 6 weeks of

ACCS

(child wellbeing) certificates (

1.1.C.15

) for a child at a particular approved child care service in a 12-month period. The 12-month period starts from the date the approved provider submits the initial certificate.

Once the 6 weeks of certificate/s have been used for a child at a particular service, the approved provider needs to apply to Services Australia for a determination (

1.1.D.78

) if the child is still considered ‘at risk’ (

1.1.A.110

).

The approved provider will need to use a new 6 weeks of certificate/s in every 12-month period before continuing to apply for determinations, if the child is still attending the service and continues to be at risk.

Example:

Cary attends Pink Donkey Child Care Centre for a few months and was given a 6-week certificate on 3 October 2022 because he was at risk at the time. It is now 31 July 2023 and Cary has returned to Pink Donkey Child Care Centre and is considered at risk again. Cary cannot be given another certificate at this service because the service has already used the 6 weeks of certificate within the last 12 months. Instead, the approved provider will need to apply to Services Australia for a determination for Cary.

Example:

Jackie also attends Pink Donkey Child Care Centre and was given a 6-week certificate on 19 December 2022 because she was at risk at the time. Following the end of the certificate, Jackie remained at the service and continued to be considered at risk. The approved provider applied for subsequent determinations over the year. It is now 29 January 2024, which is more than 12 months since the original 6-week certificate. Before they can apply for any further determinations, the approved provider must give another 6-week certificate for Jackie.

4.2.3.20 Determining an FTB claim

Summary

Once it has been established that the

FTB

claim is effective (

1.1.E.10

), and there are no restrictions on determining the claim, the claim must be determined. Eligibility for FTB must be assessed, and a decision made that either the individual is entitled or not entitled to FTB.

This topic provides information about the effect of each of these types of determination.

Types of claim determination

An FTB claim is determined according to the type of claim or combination of types. There are 3 types of entitlement determinations:

instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

), including when an FTB or regular care child has died since the claim was lodged

past period claim (

1.1.P.60

), including when an FTB or regular care child has died during the claim period, and

bereavement claim (

1.1.B.20

) lodged by an individual (

1.1.I.90

) in substitution for a deceased individual who was eligible for FTB.

If the individual (

1.1.A.72

) is not eligible for FTB, a determination is made to the effect that the individual is not entitled to the relevant part of FTB.

Combination of claim types

The claim for FTB may include a combination of past period, instalment or bereavement claims. While each part of the claim is determined under different sections of the FA(Admin)Act, from the individual's viewpoint there is nominally one claim for FTB, and one net result.

Determining an instalment claim

If an individual makes an instalment claim, and they are eligible for FTB, the claim must be determined that they are entitled to be paid from the day the claim is determined. An arrears amount is also paid for the number of days for which the individual is eligible from the date the claim is lodged to the date of the entitlement determination.

An individual is paid the daily rate calculated under the FTB income test using their and, where applicable, their partner's

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) and personal circumstances. An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) individual is not income tested.

The instalment period and payment delivery day (

1.1.P.73

) is worked out based on the day the claim was lodged. Payment is made by Centrelink.

Determining an instalment claim when an FTB or regular care child has died

If an individual's FTB or regular care child has died since the instalment claim was lodged, but before the claim is determined, the bereavement amount for the child must be paid as part of the instalment claim determination. If the individual has no ongoing entitlement, they are paid arrears of FTB for the period after the claim was lodged to the date that the child died, and a bereavement amount from the date the child died.

the whole period, or

part of the period and eligible for a bereavement amount for the remainder of the period because their FTB or regular care child died.

FTB for a past period is paid as a lump sum through Centrelink.

If an individual makes a bereavement claim because another individual has died, it must be determined that they are entitled to be paid, if the:

person who died would have been eligible for FTB, and

individual is an appropriate person to make the claim.

The amount of FTB can include a bereavement payment for the death of an FTB or regular care child, if the child died before the person died.

Determination that there is no entitlement

If the individual claims FTB, it must be determined there is no entitlement to FTB if:

they have made an effective claim for FTB

there are no restrictions on determining the claim, and

the individual is not eligible for FTB.

Examples:

They may be ineligible if:

their income is too high, or

they are not an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 19 Determination that no entitlement

Reclaiming FTB where initial claim rejected due to income

Where a claim for FTB has been determined as ineligible because the estimate of income is too high, the individual may lodge a second FTB claim, if their circumstances have changed, with a revised estimate of income.

For this second claim, it may be determined that the person is entitled to FTB by instalment from the date of lodgement of the claim if:

based on the revised estimate, the person is eligible for payment, and

the revised estimate is accepted as being reasonable.

For this second claim, the claim for FTB for the past period (period of eligibility prior to date of second claim) is not effective as a claim for this period has already been made. An application for review of the decision not to pay arrears for this past period can be made after the end of the income year when actual ATI is available.

Continuing effect of a determination

Once a determination has been made, it remains in force at all times afterwards unless it is replaced by another determination. The individual can also advise the Secretary that they wish to cease an instalment determination, subject to certain conditions being met. The determination ceases in accordance with that advice.

Explanation:

In some circumstances another determination may be made to replace the original determination. This will normally be because the individual's circumstances have changed.

The individual must be notified of the determination to either grant or reject their FTB claim.

Determining an FTB claim with

NBS

/

NBU

If an individual lodges an effective FTB claim and they are also eligible for NBS and do not intend to claim

PLP

, a determination is made that the FTB claim is granted with NBS included in the individual's FTB Part A rate. Where NBS is included in an individual's FTB Part A rate, NBU may also be payable.

If an individual lodges an effective FTB claim and is also eligible for NBS but has claimed, or indicates they intend to claim PLP, the FTB claim is determined and granted without NBS included in the individual's FTB Part A rate. If the individual later changes their decision to claim PLP or, their PLP claim is rejected, a determination is then made to include NBS in the individual's FTB Part A rate. In these circumstances, an arrears payment of NBS may occur.

1.1.N.30 Non-custodial parent, liable parent

Definition

Before the Family Law Reform changes in 1996, a non-custodial parent, also known as a liable parent, was a parent who had to pay child support to the custodian (

1.1.C.60

) of a child. The parent had to be the child's natural or adoptive parent. The term non-resident parent was also used to describe such a person prior to 1 July 2008.

The appropriate term is now 'payer' (

1.1.P.72

).

3.1.7.12 Exempt maintenance income

Summary

In some situations, maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) income received for an

FTB

child (

2.1.1.10

) is not assessed under the maintenance income test for FTB Part A. This topic provides information about exempt maintenance income where the individual:

receives maintenance for a child who does not attract more than the base rate (

1.1.B.10

) of FTB Part A

or their partner is permanently blind

receives maintenance specifically for their child's disability expenses, or

receives maintenance from the estate of a deceased payer (

1.1.P.72

).

Child does not attract more than the base rate of FTB Part A

Maintenance income is not assessable for a child who:

is not an FTB child, or

does not attract more than the base rate of FTB Part A.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20 Effect of maintenance income on FTB rate

Individual or partner is permanently blind

If an individual or their partner is permanently blind, and they receive one of the following payments:

social security

Age

or

DSP

, or

a

DVA

service pension, veteran payment or income support supplement

then maintenance income received by either the individual or their partner is not assessed. This is because their maintenance income excess is deemed to be nil.

Example:

Stella receives FTB for 2 children. The children's other parent pays child support to Stella. Stella's current partner is permanently blind and receives DSP. Therefore, the maintenance income Stella receives is not assessable under the maintenance income test.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 19B Application of maintenance income test to certain pension and benefit recipients and their partners

Policy reference:

SS Guide

1.2.3.10

Age pension (Age) - description,

1.2.5.10

Disability support pension (DSP) - description,

Service pension,

1.1.V.05

Veteran payment

Disability expenses maintenance

Maintenance income received for an FTB child specifically for expenses due to the child's permanent or long-term physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability or learning difficulty is not assessable under the maintenance income test.

Example:

Disability expenses maintenance includes:

special equipment purchase or hire

special school fees, and

medical or pharmaceutical expenses.

However, not all maintenance received for a child who has a disability is necessarily classified as disability expenses maintenance.

Example:

Kirsten's child support (

1.1.C.20

) administrative assessment is increased following a change of assessment Reason 2 decision due to the special needs of their child (CS Guide

5.2.2

). The notice of decision identifies that only part of the increase relates to the child's disability. Therefore, only the part of the increase that relates to the child's disability is disregarded under the maintenance income test for FTB Part A.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 19(3) Maintenance income

Identifying disability expenses maintenance

In most cases, disability expenses maintenance will be accounted for in the child support assessment as the assessment will normally identify the amount of maintenance paid specifically for the child's disability expenses. However, the individual should be asked to provide supporting documents if there is any doubt as to the amount of maintenance paid specifically for the child's disability expenses.

Note:

Where a child support assessment includes an amount specifically indicated for a child's disability expenses, the Registrar may provide a breakdown to the payee in writing. The payee should provide a copy of this letter or other such evidence of the child's disability expenses to the Secretary to determine what amount of the assessment should be disregarded.

Maintenance received from the estate of a deceased payer

An individual may receive a payment of maintenance arrears from the estate of a deceased payer if it is reasonable to do so. Any payment received from the estate is not assessed as maintenance income. Any arrears owing should be exempt from the maintenance income test (

3.1.5.70

).

Explanation:

Maintenance is defined as financial support from the payer to the payee (

1.1.P.71

) for a child. Since this payment has been made by the estate, not a person, it is not maintenance.

4.3.4 Instalments paid by other means

Summary

In some circumstances an individual may be granted an exemption from the requirement to provide bank details for direct credit. In this case, payment is made by other means.

Appropriate reasons for payment by other means

There are circumstances in which payment by other means may be appropriate including:

family violence

legal or administrative problems experienced by the individual, or

cultural or religious beliefs.

Each of these is explained in more detail in the rest of this topic.

Family violence

Payment by other means may be appropriate if an individual is a victim of family violence (

1.1.F.15

) and they are unable to access an account.

Legal or administrative problems experienced by the individual

Payment by other means may be appropriate when it is clear that an individual may be deprived of payments due to legal or administrative problems.

Example:

An individual may:

be bankrupt, or

have an overdrawn account.

Cultural or religious beliefs

Payment by other means may be appropriate when it is clear that an individual does not operate an account for genuine cultural or religious beliefs.

From 1 January 2016 all cheque payments ceased for payments processed by Centrelink.

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, the payment delivery day is the day an FTB instalment is normally directly credited to an applicant's account. Funds are available to the applicant on this day. The FTB payment delivery day must be a weekday.

The standard FTB payment delivery day is 2 days after the end of the instalment period. This is the time it takes for Centrelink and the financial institution to process the payment and make it available.

2.8.2 ACCS (grandparent)

Introduction

ACCS

(grandparent) is an additional subsidy that provides financial assistance with the costs of child care for eligible grandparents on income support who are the principal carers of their grandchildren.

The subsidy is equal to the actual fee charged (up to 120% of the

CCS

rate cap (

1.1.H.20

)) for up to 100 hours per fortnight. Grandparent principal carers on income support (

1.1.I.50

) do not have to meet the CCS activity test requirements.

This section explains the eligibility criteria for ACCS (grandparent).

7.2.4 Debt recovery by cash

Recovery by cash

An arrangement may be made with the debtor to recover an

FA

debt (

1.1.D.60

) by cash instalments. This is also known as a cash arrangement.

Acceptable cash repayment rates

Wherever possible, recovery of Centrelink reconciliation debt is undertaken through withholdings from

FTB

instalments or arrears. A cash repayment arrangement may be entered into in addition to withholdings, but should not be the only recovery method if withholding from FTB is an available option.

The following table outlines the acceptable cash repayment level for those who make a cash repayment arrangement.

Balance of overpayments

Amount per fortnight

Up to $750

$30

$750 - $1,500

$60

Over $1,500

Any amount that repays the overpayment within 12 months.

The amount of the instalments is determined by Centrelink in consultation with the individual, taking into account the amount of debt and individual's circumstances. An instalment can be 1 payment, if the debtor has the means to repay the debt, or an agreed number of instalments that will enable full recovery at the earliest time possible.

1.1.F.60 Full-time secondary study (FTB)

Summary

This topic discusses full-time study for

FTB

purposes and covers the following:

definition

full-time secondary study

approved course

holiday periods - continuing secondary study

intention to resume study after break in study.

Definition

An individual can be undertaking full-time study as a student in a course in an Australian institution or be studying overseas full-time. Undertaking full-time study has the same meaning under the FAAct as defined under the SSAct.

Studying overseas full-time has the meaning as defined in the

Family Assistance (Studying Overseas Full-time) Determination 2021

.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'undertaking full-time study', section

3(1)-'studying overseas full-time',

section 3C Meaning of studying overseas full-time

Full-time secondary study

The following table describes the circumstances where a secondary student is regarded as undertaking full-time study or studying overseas full-time.

If the student is studying an approved course of education or study …

then they must be …

at a secondary school, or

at an equivalent level foreign educational institution

attending full-time

undertaking a concessional study load, or

undertaking the required amount of study at the foreign educational institution.

at an Australian institution other than a secondary school, or

by correspondence/distance education at an Australian institution

enrolled in and studying at least 75% of the normal full-time study load for their course, or

undertaking a concessional study load.

to determine whether a child is a senior secondary school child, the student is subject to a determination under FAAct section

22B(2A)

undertaking the number of hours specified in the determination made under FAAct section

22B(2A).

Full-time study is a set amount of work that is accepted by the school as being full-time for any given period.

Approved course

An approved course of education or study at an Australian institution has the same meaning as under the SSAct and by extension to those courses determined by the Minister under the

Student Assistance Act 1973

to be secondary courses of study.

The following provides more information in relation to certain types of study scenarios:

Secondary school studies at more than one institution

A secondary school student may study at more than one institution, providing the student's total study-load is full-time.

School students undertaking vocation and technical education studies

Secondary school students, who attend a vocation and technical education institution for one or more days a week as part of their secondary school requirements, including students participating in a school-based apprenticeship/traineeship, are considered to be undertaking full-time secondary school studies.

Part-time courses

Two part-time courses that do not lead to one qualification cannot be considered as full-time study. If a child is doing 2 part-time courses in approved study that lead to one qualification (that is, year 12 or equivalent), this would be considered to be full-time study and the individual would be eligible for FTB for the child.

Examples:

Where 2 or more courses are linked together to form an overall qualification.

Two associated courses where one merges with or leads into the other course, such as a bridging course or a supplementary program studied concurrently.

Composite courses, also known as nested courses, where units from 2 or more different accredited courses that have the same course title recognised under the

Australian Qualifications Framework

are part of a coherent study sequence and lead to, or form part of, an overall qualification.

Full-time study in an approved foreign course of education, or study at a foreign educational institution that would assist or allow the child to complete a level of education that is broadly equivalent to an Australian secondary qualification, may qualify as approved overseas full-time study.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'approved course of education or study', section 3(1)-'studying overseas full-time', section 3C Meaning of studying overseas full-time

SSAct

section 541B(5) Meaning of approved course of education or study

Full-time study requirement

Holiday periods - continuing secondary study

If the child is intending to continue secondary studies, then it should be presumed they continue to be a senior secondary school child for FTB purposes. If they later decide not to continue their study, then they cease to be a student for FTB purposes from the date they decide they will not be continuing study.

If FTB is cancelled at the end of the calendar year on advice that the child will not be continuing full-time secondary study in the next calendar year but they do end up continuing secondary study on the first day of classes, then their eligibility for FTB during the holiday period should be restored on the basis that the actual circumstances have turned out differently from the anticipated circumstances. In this situation the child should not be treated differently from those children who intended to continue their studies.

Note:

Separate rules apply to repeating students - see

1.1.S.27

for more detail.

Intention to resume secondary study after break in study

Where a child has not been in full-time secondary study for a period of time and the parent or carer of the child advises that the child intends to resume full-time secondary study, eligibility can only commence from the date the child actually recommences full-time secondary study. This policy applies whether the parent or carer is a new claimant or a person whose eligibility was previously cancelled.

Under FA(Admin)Act section 105 the Secretary may initiate a review of a previous decision if it is felt there are sufficient grounds to do so. The decision to not pay FTB can therefore be varied from the appropriate date and the individual can be paid their arrears entitlement.

1.1.S.105 Standard reduction (FTB)

Definition

The standard reduction for an

FTB

advance (

1.2.8.10

) is the amount worked out using the following formula:

When an individual receives FTB advance, the individual's annual FTB Part A is reduced by the standard reduction amount during the repayment period (

1.1.R.33

) as calculated above, unless the Secretary has determined that a shorter repayment period applies (

1.2.8.20

).

The practical effect of the reduction of the individual's annual FTB Part A during the repayment period is that the individual's daily rate of FTB Part A is reduced by the outstanding amount of the advance payment divided by the number of days remaining in the repayment period.

Example:

Ian has 2 children aged 10 and 11. His annual FTB Part A entitlement is $8,358.50. He requests a $500 advance to be repaid over a period of 182 days.

The standard reduction for the advance is $500 ÷ 182 × 365 = $1,002.74 …

Ian's annual FTB Part A rate is then reduced by the standard reduction $8,358.50 - $1,002.74 … = $7,355.75 …

This is then converted to a daily rate, and applies for the 182 day repayment period $7,355.75 … ÷ 365 = $20.15.

For the remaining 183 days in the year, Ian's daily rate is his annual entitlement divided by 365: $8,358.50 … ÷ 365 = $22.90.

Blended families

When an FTB advance is paid to a member of a couple in a blended family (

1.1.B.30

), the standard reduction for the advance is the amount worked out using the following formula, and the reduction is applied to the family's total annual FTB Part A rate:

The family's total FTB Part A rate is then apportioned to the individual members according to their individual blended family percentage; however the reduction in FTB Part A is only actually applied during the repayment period to the individual who was paid the advance.

Example:

Ian and Anne are members of a blended family with 2 children aged 10 and 11. Their combined annual FTB Part A entitlement is $8,358.50, and they each receive 50%. Ian requests a $500 advance to be repaid over a period of 182 days.

The standard reduction for the advance is $500 ÷ 182 × 365 = $1,002.74 … and as Ian is a member of a blended family, this is divided by his blended family percentage $1,002.74 … ÷ 50% = $2,005.49 …

The family's combined annual FTB Part A rate is then reduced by the standard reduction $8,358.50 - $2,005.49 … = $6,353.00 …

This amount is then split according to the blended family percentage $6,353.00 … × 50% = $3,176.50 …, converted to a daily rate $3,176.50 … ÷ 365 = $8.70 … and applies to Ian's payment for the 182 day repayment period.

For the remaining 183 days in the year, Ian's daily rate is his blended family percentage of the family's annual rate divided by 365: $8,358.50 × 50% ÷ 365 = $11.45.

As Anne did not request an advance payment her daily FTB rate remains as $11.45 throughout the year.

1.1.R.33 Repayment period (FTB advance)

Definition

Repayment period is the period following receipt of an

FTB

advance (

1.2.8.10

) during which an individual's FTB Part A rate is reduced to repay the advance. The original repayment period (

1.1.O.30

) is usually a period of 182 days; however the Secretary may also determine that a shorter or longer period applies based on the individual's circumstances on the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

).

For one-off advances and a first regular advance, the reduction of the FTB Part A rate should start from the day after the end of the instalment period ending after the advance assessment day, or from the first day from which it is practicable to adjust the individual's FTB Part A rate due to the advance.

For second and subsequent regular advances, the repayment period begins on the day after the end of the last 182 day interval. The first 182 day interval begins on the day the repayment period for the first regular advance began, and second and subsequent 182 day intervals begin on the day after the end of the last 182 day interval.

6.4.1.40 Outcomes of reconciliation

Summary

This topic provides a summary of the outcomes that may result from the reconciliation of

FA

(

1.1.F.02

). The outcome of reconciliation may be a:

nil adjustment

top-up (positive adjustment), or

overpayment (negative adjustment).

There are timing restrictions on when individuals (

1.1.I.90

) can receive top-up payments under reconciliation conditions (

6.4.1.30

).

This topic also covers:

review of reconciliation decisions, and

reconciliation after the end of the lodgement period.

Nil adjustment

When an individual's entitlement to

FTB

or

CCS

is the same as the amount they received for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

), there is a nil adjustment. This means the individual has received their exact entitlement. For CCS, any withheld amounts will be paid as a lump sum direct to the individual.

Top-up (positive adjustment)

When an individual's entitlement to FTB or CCS for the relevant income year is more than the amount they received for the relevant income year, there is a positive adjustment. This means the individual will receive the difference between what they should have been paid and what they actually received for the relevant income year. A top-up may result if the individual's estimated

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is higher than their actual ATI. For FTB, a top-up may also result if the individual chooses a More Choice for Families payment option that allows them to receive part of their entitlement during the income year and the rest of their entitlements after their payments have been reconciled.

Note:

RA

will be included in an individual's FTB top-up if:

their FTB Part A entitlement is more than the base rate

they would have received RA during the relevant income year except for the fact that they were only paid the base rate due of FTB Part A due to their estimated income, and

their rent details have been verified by Centrelink.

Example:

Amanda is a member of a couple and receives FTB Part A by instalment for their 2 year old child. Amanda pays private rent of $470 per week. As Amanda receives more than the base rate of FTB Part A, they receive some RA as part of their fortnightly instalments. At the end of the income year, it is determined that Amanda's actual family income makes them eligible for the maximum rate of FTB Part A including the maximum rate of RA. Amanda receives a top-up.

For CCS, if reconciliation, or the review of the reconciliation outcome, is initiated through the provision of an updated 'attendance record report' after the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

), it may result in a top-up.

Overpayment (negative adjustment)

When an individual's entitlement to FTB or CCS is less than the amount they received for the relevant income year, there is an overpayment (negative adjustment). This means the difference between what they actually received and what they should have been paid for the relevant income year will be raised as an overpayment. The individual's income tax refund, as well as the income tax refund of another consenting adult, may also be used to recover any balance of the overpayment. An overpayment may result if the individual's estimated ATI is lower than their actual ATI. Other methods of recovery, including withholdings and garnishee, may also be used.

Payments affected by reconciliation,

6.4.1.30

Reconciliation process,

6.4.2.10

Verification of adjusted taxable income

Review of reconciliation decisions

An individual's FA can be re-reconciled if:

ATI for either the individual or partner (

1.1.P.30

) changes

Example:

An individual's taxable income is re-assessed by the

ATO

, a non-lodger (

1.1.N.33

) lodges an income tax return, or an individual who is not required to lodge an income tax return revises their ATI notification.

maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

) for either the individual or partner changes

Example:

Child Support modifies a disbursement amount or retrospectively adjusts a private collect assessment.

information is provided that an FTB child of the individual has met health check or immunisation requirements since the date of the previous reconciliation.

An individual's CCS will also be re-reconciled if an approved child care service submits an updated 'attendance record report' substituting new attendance information for that already provided. Processing of this information will result in an automatic re-reconciliation. This differs from a review initiated by an individual as it will usually occur without the individual's prior knowledge.

Re-reconciliation where individual lodges late (not relevant for CCS or

ACCS

)

In normal circumstances, where an individual is required to lodge an income tax return in order for reconciliation to take place, and they do not do so within 12 months from the end of the relevant income year, they would be considered a late lodger. In such cases, the late lodger provisions exclude payment of a top-up. Where an individual's entitlement was originally reconciled on the basis that they were not required to lodge an income tax return, but they later lodge an income tax return more than 12 months after the end of the relevant income year, the late lodger rules cannot apply. A non-lodger determination cannot be made at this re-reconciliation stage because the individual has already lodged their tax return. However, family assistance law still works to:

exclude the FTB supplements from the recipients' entitlement as the reconciliation conditions were not satisfied on time, and

limit the payment of any additional FTB top-ups via the date of effect rules relating to favourable decisions.

In re-reconciliation in the above circumstances, there are 3 rates that are considered:

Rate 1: the amount the individual was paid via instalments during the relevant income year.

Rate 2: the amount the individual was entitled to following the original reconciliation (including supplements).

Rate 3: the amount the individual is now entitled to based on their actual ATI following tax lodgement (excluding supplements, as reconciliation conditions were not satisfied on time).

The re-reconciliation compares Rates 2 and 3 above. If the Rate 3 amount is higher than the Rate 2 amount, the date of effect rules would act to limit payment of any top-up if the re-reconciliation decision is made more than 52 weeks after the individual was given notice of the original reconciliation. If the re-reconciliation decision is made less than 52 weeks after the individual was given notice of the original reconciliation, arrears would be payable.

If the Rate 3 amount is lower than the Rate 2 amount, there is no limit to the date of effect and the Rate 3 amount would be the amount the individual is entitled to, meaning a debt is raised for the difference between Rate 2 and Rate 3.

Example:

Bob received FTB via instalments for the relevant income year. On 13 July of the lodgement year, Bob advised Centrelink that they were not required to lodge an income tax return and notified Centrelink of their ATI. FTB supplements and top-ups were then paid to Bob upon reconciliation.

On 25 July of the income year following the lodgement year, Bob lodged an income tax return for the relevant income year, despite prior advice that they were not required to lodge. Bob's entitlement for the relevant income year was recalculated based on the actual ATI details provided by the ATO. Bob's rates for the relevant income year were as follows:

Rate 1: $9,000 (amount paid during income year).

Rate 2: $13,000 (annual entitlement following reconciliation including supplements).

Rate 3: $10,000 (annual entitlement following re-reconciliation, excluding supplements).

As Bob's Rate 3 amount is less than their Rate 2 amount, they will have a debt of $3,000. However, it is worth noting that Bob's annual entitlement after re-reconciliation is still greater than what they received during the year. Had Bob simply lodged their income tax return late, rather than advising that they were not required to lodge in the intervening period, they would only have been entitled to $9,000.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 28 Variation of instalment and past period entitlement determinations where income tax return not lodged, section 32A FTB Part A supplement and FTB Part B supplement to be disregarded unless and until individual has satisfied the FTB reconciliation conditions, section 32C Relevant reconciliation time—first individual must lodge tax return, section 32J Relevant reconciliation time—individual not required to lodge an income tax return, section 107 Date of effect of certain decisions made under section 105 in relation to FTB by instalment

Requirement to lodge an income tax return

Reconciliation after the end of the lodgement period (not relevant for CCS or ACCS)

Where reconciliation is initiated through the provision of actual ATI or maintenance income after the end of the lodgement year, it can only result in a nil or negative adjustment. This may occur where the individual and/or their partner lodge an income tax return after the lodgement year.

Note:

If an income tax return is not lodged by the individual and/or their partner, or if either they and/or their partner do not notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, before the end of the lodgement year, no top-ups or FTB supplements are payable.

A non-lodger debt will be raised after the end of the lodgement year if the individual and/or their partner fail to lodge a tax return or to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return.

1.1.M.22 Maintenance income test ceiling (FTB)

Definition

The maintenance income test (MIT) ceiling limits the amount of child support that can reduce the above base rate amounts of

FTB

Part A. A MIT ceiling must be determined where there are child support children and non-child support children in the family, or where an individual has more than one child support case.

The method of calculating the MIT ceiling limit depends on whether the family’s

ATI

is above or below the high income free area (HIFA) (

3.1.1.20

).

The MIT ceiling ensures that any child support received will only reduce the individual's above base rate amounts of FTB Part A for the child support children. Any child support income above the MIT ceiling is disregarded.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 Division 5 Subdivision A section 20 Effect of maintenance income on FTB rate, Schedule 1 Division 5 Subdivision C Maintenance income ceiling for Method 1, Schedule 1 Division 5 Subdivision D Maintenance income ceiling for purposes of comparison for Method 2

Definition

The minimum amount payable to an individual who is eligible for

FTB

advance, other than a member of a blended family (

3.1.6.10 Proof of parentage

Acceptable evidence

If an individual is applying for a child support assessment for a child from a previous relationship and none of the presumptions of parentage (

1.1.P.110

) apply, the individual must supply documentary evidence that the person being asked to pay child support (

1.1.C.20

) is the child's parent (

1.1.P.10

).

Acceptable evidence of parentage is:

the child's birth certificate naming the other parent

a statutory declaration

from the person making the application stating that the name of the person being asked to pay child support is recorded as a parent of the child in a register of births, or

completed by the person being asked to pay child support stating they are a parent of the child

adoption papers stating the name of the person being asked to pay child support and the relationship of that person to the child, or

a court ruling on paternity.

Individual is unable to obtain acceptable evidence

If an individual is unable to obtain acceptable evidence of parentage, then Child Support will reject their application. Once notified that their application is unsuccessful, the individual should be referred to Legal Aid or a solicitor for assistance to establish the payer's (

1.1.P.72

) identity.

Note:

Individuals should be advised that if they choose to use a private solicitor they must pay all associated costs, unless any are covered by Legal Aid.

Act reference:

CSA Act

section 29(2) How decision is to be made

Conflicting information about parentage

Centrelink is not required to make a decision regarding conflicting information about parentage. If there is conflicting information about parentage under:

Stage 1, the court makes a decision on who is the parent of the child, or

Stage 2, the Child Support Registrar may resolve the conflict.

Example:

One person is named on the birth certificate as a parent, but in an application for child support, the birth mother indicates that they were in a relationship with another person at the time of conception.

Where conflicting information about parentage exists, the court or the Child Support Registrar must be told that the individual is applying for child support.

Explanation:

If the individual named as the other parent in the child support application is different to the individual named on the child's birth certificate, Child Support must make a decision about the conflicting information. However, if the applicant does not indicate that the other parent is not the individual named on the birth certificate, Child Support will make the decision on the application based on the information in the application.

Where there is documentary evidence that an individual is the other parent of a child, but the child support applicant states that another individual is in fact the other parent, the applicant must provide documentary evidence confirming that the individual they are naming as the other parent is in fact the other parent.

In these cases, and in cases where an individual is named as a parent under the presumption of parentage provisions, but the named individual disputes that they are the other parent, they may lodge an objection with Child Support.

1.1.R.35 Reportable superannuation contribution

Definition

Reportable superannuation contributions, for an individual and an income year, means the sum of:

the individual's reportable employer superannuation contributions (if any) for the income year, and

the individual's deductions (if any) under

Income Tax Assessment Act 1997

subdivision 290-C for the income year.

Definition: reportable employer superannuation contributions

Reportable employer superannuation contributions are those contributions an employer makes for an employee where all of the following apply:

the employee influenced the rate or amount the employer contributed for them, and

the contributions are additional to the compulsory contributions an employer must make under any of the following

superannuation guarantee law

an industrial agreement

the trust deed or governing rules of a superannuation fund, or

a federal, state or territory law.

Superannuation contributions that an employer must make to an employee may be known as superannuation guarantee or mandated contributions. These contributions are not considered to be reportable employer superannuation contributions.

Example:

A common example of a reportable employer superannuation contribution is a contribution an employer makes on behalf of an employee to a superannuation fund under a salary sacrifice arrangement.

Definition: personal deductible superannuation contributions

Reportable superannuation contributions also include any personal contributions made to a superannuation fund for which an income tax deduction is claimed on an individual's tax return.

Personal deductible superannuation contributions will be added to any reportable employer superannuation contributions reported on the tax return. The total will form the reportable superannuation contribution amount.

2.11.1 SIFS eligibility criteria

Eligibility criteria

An individual is eligible for the

SIFS

in relation to a particular day in a financial year if the following applies:

the individual was an existing recipient on 30 June 2017 and maintained continuous eligibility from 1 July 2017, and

the individual has at least one qualifying SIFS child (

2.11.2

), and

the individual is an Australian resident (

2.1.2

), or

the individual is an

SCV

holder residing in Australia (

2.1.2.20

), and

the individual is not an absent overseas recipient (

2.1.2.40

), and

the main income earner has a taxable income between $68,000 and $150,000, and

if the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

), or was a member of a couple at any time during the financial year in which they are claiming, then the income of the secondary income earner must be below $18,000.

ACO

s are not eligible for SIFS.

Sharing SIFS payments between separated couples for period prior to separation

Where individuals separate and claim SIFS for the period which includes 30 June 2017, SIFS will be split between them according to the percentage determined by the Secretary for

FTB

purposes (

3.1.1.34

) and they will be grandfathered for that past period. Both individuals will continue to be eligible for SIFS as long as they continue to meet the SIFS eligibility requirements in their own right from the day after the period they were a couple.

Where individuals separate but do not split SIFS for past period that includes 30 June 2017, only the individual who previously received SIFS will remain eligible for SIFS, as long as they continue to meet the SIFS eligibility requirements. The other individual, however, will not be eligible for SIFS.

Individuals in a blended family who split SIFS on 30 June 2017 will be grandfathered until the first day they do not meet the SIFS eligibility requirements, even if they separate.

Death of an eligible person before payment is made

Another individual becomes eligible for SIFS but the grandfathering status does not transfer, if the individual who was originally eligible on 30 June 2017 dies:

before being paid SIFS

the other individual claims SIFS because the individual who was originally eligible died, and

the delegate considers that the other individual should be eligible for the unpaid amount of SIFS.

The other individual must lodge a claim for SIFS. It does not matter if the person who died had not lodged a claim for SIFS.

2.6.3 CCS eligibility - attending secondary school

Summary

For an individual (

1.1.I.90

) to be eligible for

CCS

, the child must be aged 13 and under and not be attending secondary school (unless the child is a member of a prescribed class).

As per the

Australian Education Regulations 2023

made under the

Australian Education Act 2013

, for the purpose of CCS, secondary school is:

for schools other than special schools, in all states and territories secondary education constitutes years 7 to 12.

for special schools, secondary education constitutes education provided to students aged 12 to 21 at the school.

For the purposes of CCS, a child will be taken to be attending secondary school when they are enrolled and scheduled to attend their first day of secondary school. This means children who are aged 13 and under will be eligible for CCS up to and including the day before they are scheduled to attend their first day of secondary school (

1.1.C.18

). For example, the child could be taken to be attending secondary school if they are enrolled at secondary school and classes have started, even if they do not attend a particular day of secondary school (that is, if unwell on their first day, or if they never physically attend school because they are doing distance education).

Individuals are obliged to notify Centrelink of any change of circumstances that affects their eligibility or entitlement (

1.1.E.30

), including that their child has started attending secondary school. Individuals with children of secondary school age will receive a reminder in January to notify the date their child is enrolled to start secondary school, if they have not already provided this information.

Members of a prescribed class

The CCSMinRules prescribe certain classes of children for whom an individual can be eligible for CCS and/or

ACCS

despite the child not meeting age and school status eligibility criteria (

2.6.2.10

).

3.1.5.25 Who is entitled to apply for maintenance

Summary

Generally, an individual may apply for a child support assessment for a child under 18 if they care for the child and are not living with a parent of the child as their partner on a genuine domestic basis. They may be the other parent of the child or another individual (for example, grandmother) as long as the child is in their care. The applicable law is the

CSA Act

. Where an individual is not eligible for a child support assessment they may be able to apply for a child maintenance order under the

Family Law Act 1975

.

Note:

The

MAT

does not apply to individuals who have care of a child, but are not considered to be their parent.

Applications for child support assessment

Refer to CS Guide

2.1.1

for information about applying for a child support assessment.

Applications for maintenance under the Family Law Act

An individual who is not eligible for a child support assessment and wishes to apply for maintenance under the Family Law Act should seek legal advice on whether an entitlement exists.

3.1.6.20 Presumption of parentage - Stage 2

Presumption of parentage

The following table outlines the grounds for presumption of parentage (

1.1.P.110

) for ex-nuptial children (

1.1.E.60

) that do not require documentary evidence. In the following situations, the child could reasonably have been conceived during the period of cohabitation (

1.1.C.40

).

Where a child is born to a woman …

but who …

the couple are presumed to be the parents if …

who cohabited with a man

was not married to the man during this period

the period of cohabitation was at any time during the period beginning 44 weeks and ending 20 weeks before the child was born.

who separated from her husband

resumed cohabitation with him again on one occasion for a period of not more than 3 months and then separated again

the child was born within 44 weeks after this period of cohabitation and after the divorce.

Refer to Explanation below.

whose marriage was annulled

-

the child was born within 44 weeks of the annulment.

Explanation:

The period of less than 3 months is significant because:

if they resume cohabitation for a longer period they must wait a further 12 months before divorcing, and

any child conceived during the resumed period of cohabitation would be born while the marriage still existed and no proof of parentage is required.

If there are any ex-nuptial children to whom none of the presumptions apply, documentary evidence of parentage must be provided.

It is not compulsory for individuals to use the presumption of parentage provisions. If an individual has strong objections to apply for a child support assessment for an ex-nuptial child using these provisions, they need to provide documentary evidence of parentage instead.

2.8.4.30 ACCS (transition to work) - Job Plan requirements

Summary

This topic describes the eligibility requirements relating to Job Plans (

1.1.J.20

) for

ACCS

(transition to work). This topic covers:

Job Plans

disability support pension

activating a Job Plan

inactive Job Plans.

Job Plans

Where individuals are required to have a Job Plan as a condition of their income support payment, they must have an active Job Plan in place to receive ACCS (transition to work). A Job Plan is an

EPP

which may be entered into to meet the participation requirements of an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

). An EPP includes:

a

PP

EPP

a

YA

EPP

a

JSP

EPP

an

SpB

EPP.

Disability support pension

In the case of an individual in receipt of

DSP

, a Job Plan is a participation plan entered into under SSAct section 94B.

Act reference:

SSAct

section 94B Participation plans

Activating a Job Plan

If an individual already has a DSP participation plan or Job Plan that is active and meets the requirements, then they will not need to change or update their plan to include their ACCS (transition to work) activity/ies if it is not required for their income support payment.

If an individual does not have an active Job Plan but they are required to, applicants will have 28 days from the date they apply for ACCS (transition to work) to enter into a Job Plan with Centrelink or an employment service provider. If the Job Plan is not active, payments cannot be made until the Monday of the

CCS

fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) after the Job Plan is active.

Inactive Job Plans

If an individual’s Job Plan becomes inactive while in receipt of ACCS (transition to work) they will no longer be eligible for ACCS (transition to work) from the first Monday of the next CCS fortnight, unless their Job Plan is reactivated, or they enter into another Job Plan before the start of the next CCS fortnight. If a Job Plan is not in effect on the Monday of a CCS fortnight, ACCS (transition to work) will be cancelled, and the individual will need to re-apply for ACCS (transition to work).

If an individual is required to have a Job Plan and fails to enter into a Job Plan within 28 days of applying for ACCS (transition to work) their application for ACCS (transition to work) will be considered to have not been made, and they will have to re-apply.

1.1.S.27 Senior secondary school child (FTB)

Summary

This topic defines what is a senior secondary school child for

FTB

purposes, and covers the following:

definition

completion day

child again becomes a senior secondary school child.

Definition: senior secondary school child

An FTB child aged 16 to 19 years (up to the end of the calendar year in which they turn 19) is a senior secondary school child if the child is either:

undertaking full-time study in an approved course of education or study that would, in the Secretary's opinion, assist or allow the child to complete the final year of secondary school or an equivalent level of education

studying overseas full-time in an approved foreign course of education or study that would assist or allow the child to complete a level of education that is broadly equivalent to an Australian secondary qualification, or

exempt from the full-time study requirement for secondary school children (

2.1.1.11

).

Note:

For the purposes of FTB Part B and

MBA

, a child is a senior secondary school child only up to the end of the calendar year the child turns 18.

'Secondary school' means a school,

TAFE

college, or any other educational institution, which provides full-time secondary education. A secondary school also includes a school that caters for the needs of children with learning difficulties and provides a form of education that is accepted as a secondary course. A secondary school may also include a registered educational institution in a foreign country.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'approved course of education or study', section 3(1)-'studying overseas full-time', section 3C Meaning of studying overseas full-time

SSAct

Student Assistance Act 1973

section 5D Minister may determine secondary and tertiary courses etc.

Student Assistance (Education Institutions and Courses) Determination 2019

Family Assistance (Studying Overseas Full-time) Determination 2021

Completion day

When an FTB child completes the final year of secondary school or an equivalent level of education, the child is no longer a senior secondary school child. However, the exception to this rule is where a child completes the final year of secondary school or equivalent and returns to repeat the same approved full-time secondary course of education or study at any time in the first term after the end of their last study period. In this situation the child does not cease to be a senior secondary school child (see also

'Child again becomes a senior secondary school child'

below).

An FTB child who is completing their final year of study is taken to be a senior secondary school child until:

31 December of that year - if the completion day of the secondary school or equivalent level of education is in November or December, or

the end of the period of 28 days beginning on the day after the completion day - if the completion day is before November.

The completion day for the final year of secondary school or an equivalent level of education is worked out in accordance with the following table:

Completion day

Item

In this situation:

The day is:

1

the child was not required to sit an examination in relation to that final year or that equivalent level of education.

the day determined by the secondary school to be the last day of classes for that year or by the provider of that education to be the last day of classes for that level of education (as the case may be).

2

the child was required to sit an examination in relation to that final year or that equivalent level of education.

the later of:

the day determined by the secondary school to be the last day of the period of examinations for that final year or by the provider of that education to be the last day of the period of examinations for that level of education (as the case may be), and

the day determined by the secondary school to be the last day of classes for that final year or by the provider of that education to be the last day of classes for that level of education (as the case may be).

Child again becomes a senior secondary school child

A child who ceased being a senior secondary school child because they attained their year 12 or equivalent qualification, may again become a senior secondary school child if:

the child is aged 16 to 19 and the calendar year in which the child turns 19 has not ended, and

the child repeats the final year of the same approved full-time secondary course of education or study that would, in the Secretary's opinion, assist or allow the child to complete the final year of secondary school or an equivalent level of education and the child goes back to school after the end of the first term following the end of their last study period.

Explanation:

The child may wish to improve upon their results achieved when they first completed the course. However, if the child was undertaking a course at certificate level ll or higher after completing their year 12 certificate, this would be considered a post-secondary course and they would not be a senior secondary school child.

3.2.8.20 Estimate following cancellation of income support payment or during employment income nil rate period

Summary

This topic covers information relating to income support individuals and includes the following:

income support individuals -

FTB

income support individuals -

CCS

income support payment cancelled, and

employment income nil rate period - FTB.

Note:

This topic is not relevant to

SBP

.

Income support individuals - FTB

If the individual (

1.1.I.90

) or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) receive an income support payment, they are not subject to the income test for FTB Part A. They are eligible for the maximum rate of FTB Part A, subject to the

MIT

(

1.1.M.10

) and

MAT

.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 38L Application of income test to pension and benefit recipients and their partners

Income support individuals - CCS

All individuals, including income support recipients (

1.1.I.50

), need to provide an estimate of income when claiming CCS to determine their rate of subsidy.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 2 Part 1 Amount of CCS, Schedule 2 Part 2 Amount of ACCS (child wellbeing), ACCS (temporary financial hardship) or ACCS (grandparent) for an individual, Schedule 2 Part 3 Amount of ACCS (transition to work)

Income support payment cancelled

If both the individual and their partner lose eligibility for the pension or benefit, their eligibility for FTB must be reassessed and the income test applied. Their CCS entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) will also be reassessed if applicable. For FTB purposes, recipients of an income support payment on an income nil rate period are not considered to be receiving an income support payment and are subject to the income test for FTB Part A.

The individual and their partner must provide an estimate of their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for the current financial year. For FTB, the income test must be applied to work out their new rate of FTB. For CCS, the individual will already have an income estimate in place, but they may need to update this if the cancellation of the income support payment has affected their income estimate for the year.

Employment income nil rate period - FTB

Income support recipients or their partners in an employment income nil rate period who also receive FTB will have 21 days to provide an estimate of their ATI for the current financial year from the start of the nil rate period. The estimate will be applied as soon as it is received and the income-tested rate will be applied from the start of the income nil rate period.

5.2.1.20 Change of eligibility circumstances

Summary

A person (

1.1.P.80

) is required to provide information regarding all circumstances that may affect their eligibility to receive

FA

(

1.1.F.02

). This topic covers:

eligibility circumstances affecting FA

FTB

eligibility circumstances affecting only FTB Part B

eligibility circumstances affecting only

CCS

and

ACCS

.

Eligibility circumstances affecting FA

they and/or their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) income changes

they change partnering arrangements (opposite or same-sex) for example, if they get married, registered, separated or divorced, or

their address or bank account details change.

Eligibility circumstances affecting only FTB

An individual must notify Centrelink if:

they are a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) and the other member of the couple ceases to receive FTB for their child/ren

their percentage of care for an FTB or regular care child changes, particularly if it reaches or falls below 35% or 66% of the care period, or

their FTB or regular care child dies.

An individual must also notify Centrelink if their FTB or regular care child:

commences or ceases to receive an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

)

is aged 16 to 19 years and ceases or recommences full-time secondary study (

1.1.F.60

1.1.C.05

)

leaves Australia temporarily or permanently

their temporary absence overseas becomes permanent, or

returns to Australia.

Explanation:

If an FTB or regular care child of an individual becomes the partner of that individual, they are no longer an FTB or regular care child of the individual. The individual's eligibility to receive FTB or other government benefits for that child ceases.

If an FTB or regular care child becomes a member of a couple, they may no longer be living with or in the care of the entitled carer. In this case, eligibility to receive FTB for that child may cease.

Centrelink must also be notified if a care organisation commences or ceases to be an

ACO

6.4.3.50 Deferral of prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

Summary

Individuals are able to request a deferral of a prohibition of

FTB

based on an estimate (

1.1.P.135

) or the non-entitlement to FTB (

1.1.N.31

) if they have special circumstances.

Special circumstances are by their very nature incapable of precise or exhaustive definition. The qualifying adjective 'special' looks to circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Whether circumstances answer any of these descriptions must depend upon the context in which they occur.

It is not possible to predict all the situations where special circumstances should be applied as the circumstances of each particular situation need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Domestic/family violence (

1.1.F.15

), natural disasters or bereavement situations could be possible examples of where special circumstances could be applied.

All deferrals are approved on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Secretary after consideration of the individual circumstances; these are not able to be applied automatically.

Deferral of prohibition

As a general rule, individuals may request a deferral of the application of the prohibition of FTB due to special circumstances, such as a result of hardship, evidence of lodgement and/or an

ATO

tax lodgement deferral, or review and appeals. Individuals may also seek deferral under other special circumstances.

Deferral of prohibition - hardship

Prohibition of FTB based on an estimate may be temporarily deferred at the request of an individual who is experiencing hardship, for example, due to:

domestic/family violence (referral to a social worker or

ISO

is required) (up to 6 months)

severe financial hardship (up to 4 weeks), or

severe illness (up to 6 months).

Deferrals under hardship provisions may be backdated to apply from a day in the past at the discretion of the Secretary.

Deferral of prohibition - income tax return deferrals or lodgement enforcement suspensions

A prohibition may be temporarily deferred for an individual (or their partner, if applicable) who has been granted a tax lodgement deferral by the ATO or where the ATO has suspended any lodgement enforcement action regarding an outstanding income tax return. These deferrals are generally for a period up to ATO due date plus 7 days.

You can find more information about tax lodgement deferrals and suspensions of enforcement action on the

ATO website

.

If there have been a number of non-lodger decisions for previous income years and the individual has only been granted an ATO deferral or lodgement enforcement suspension for one of these years, the prohibition of FTB will still be applied for the other years.

Deferral of prohibition - reviews & appeals

If an individual seeks a review of or appeals a decision to apply prohibition, the prohibition period may be deferred until the review and/or appeal process is complete.

If an individual seeks a review of or appeals all of the non-lodger decisions that led to the application of the prohibition, the prohibition period may be deferred until the review and/or appeal process is complete.

If there have been a number of non-lodger decisions for previous income years and the individual has not sought a review of or appealed all of those decisions, the prohibition period will still be applied for the other previous income years while the review and/or appeal process is in progress.

A special circumstances deferral may also apply to an individual who is no longer entitled to FTB as a result of the application of the non-entitlement provision outlined in

6.4.3.70

.

1.1.S.45 Severe financial hardship

Summary

Severe financial hardship should be decided on an individual basis for the purpose of:

waiving (

1.1.W.10

) a Centrelink debt attributable solely to administrative error (which may be up to 100% of the total debt)

for the purpose of writing-off a Centrelink debt

making a decision about reducing or suspending the recovery of an

FTB

advance, or

reconsidering debt offsetting decisions.

The definition of severe financial hardship is to be used when establishing whether an individual would suffer severe financial hardship if they had to repay a debt under

FA

law or if their FTB Part A continued to be reduced by the standard advance reduction (

1.1.S.105

) applicable to their outstanding FTB advance.

Severe financial hardship

The issue of severe financial hardship should be decided on an individual basis, taking into account the individual's circumstances. These would include:

the make up of the family group (for example, single parent, number of children etc.)

current family income and expenses

minimum amount of expected debt repayment under Centrelink guidelines

standard reduction amounts for any outstanding FTB advances

available funds, and

exceptional expenses (for example, funeral or pharmaceutical costs).

There must be clear evidence that severe financial hardship would result (after reasonable expenses are deducted from income) if recovery of a debt were pursued, or if the standard FTB advance reduction rate continued to apply. Reasonable expenditure includes, but is not limited to: rent, groceries, electricity, minimum loan repayments, school fees, medical costs etc.

The rate of income support including the FA a family group would be paid (if they were eligible), may be used as a benchmark when comparing the family's income and expenditure. If the family's income is greater than this amount but their reported expenditure leaves a net income less than the minimum debt repayment or standard advance reduction amount, then it may be relevant to examine whether their expenditure is reasonable.

For the purpose of considering a waiver or a write-off, or reducing or suspending recovery of an FTB advance a person would be subject to severe financial hardship if their net fortnightly income (after reasonable expenses are deducted from gross income) over the debt repayment period (for both debts and advance recovery) would be less than the minimum fortnightly amount the person would be allowed to repay under the flexible repayment arrangements for FA debts or the standard reduction for their outstanding FTB advance.

Note:

For decisions relating to FTB advances, a person's gross income should include FTB prior to any existing FTB advance reductions.

Example 1:

Lydia is a sole parent in receipt of

PP

and FTB. She has an FTB debt, which was caused solely by administrative error and was received in good faith. Lydia has appealed against the decision to recover the debt as she says that this would place her family in severe financial hardship. Lydia has provided Centrelink with information to support her request including a detailed fortnightly statement of financial circumstances listing her income and expenditure. Lydia's expenses are reasonable and include necessary costs such as rent, food, petrol, electricity, gas and school fees. She has provided supporting receipts and invoices. In addition to her regular expenses Lydia also has substantial debts due to a recent illness and has no savings or readily convertible assets.

After taking into account Lydia's regular expenses it was found that her remaining income would be less than the minimum repayment amount required over the repayment period. It is clear that Lydia could not sustain her financial responsibilities and repay the debt. Recovery would cause Lydia severe financial hardship and the debt may be waived.

Example 2:

Charmaine is a sole parent and receives FTB Part B and maximum rate FTB Part A for her 2 children. She earns approximately $15,000 per annum from a small business she runs from home, but cannot get

PPS

because she also has a share in a commercial property and is over the asset limit. Charmaine applied for and received a one-off advance prior to Christmas, and the standard reduction for her advance is $48.60 per fortnight.

Charmaine was involved in a car accident and due to her injuries she will not be able to earn any income from her business for several months, and has requested that her advance repayments be suspended until she is back on her feet. Charmaine has provided Centrelink with information to support her request including her fortnightly income and expenditure. Charmaine's expenses are reasonable and include necessary costs such as mortgage repayments, food, utilities, education and transport costs.

After taking into account Charmaine's gross income and regular expenses, it was found she would have $30 per fortnight left over, prior to the advance repayment. Charmaine has no savings or liquid assets that can be readily converted to cash. It is clear that in her changed circumstances, Charmaine could not sustain her financial responsibilities and repay the advance at the standard reduction without suffering severe financial hardship.

The customer service advisor considers reducing Charmaine's advance repayments, but in the circumstances it is decided that suspending the advance recovery for the maximum 13 weeks is a more appropriate response to Charmaine's situation.

1.1.E.15 Election of subsidised care (CCS)

Definition

CCS

eligible individuals (

1.1.I.90

) with a subsidised hours result greater than zero, and whose child is enrolled at more than one approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

), can elect the maximum number of subsidised hours each child care service can receive on their behalf per fortnight.

Individuals can do this through Centrelink (online, in person, or over the phone). This information will be recorded through

CCSS

to assist with the calculation of CCS.

If an individual makes an election, they must apportion their total eligible hours across services, in whole hours. The election will apply from the beginning of the next CCS fortnight (applies to new and varied apportionment of hours).

Example:

An individual is entitled to up to 100 hours of CCS per fortnight, based on their subsidised hours result. Their child attends an

FDC

service 3 days (36 hours) a week for a total of 72 hours per fortnight, and a

CBDC

service 2 days (20 hours) a week for a total of 40 hours per fortnight.

The number of hours the child is enrolled (

1.1.E.25

) in per fortnight (112) is higher than the number of subsidised hours that the individual is entitled to receive per fortnight (100). Therefore, the individual elects to allocate a maximum of 60 subsidised hours per fortnight to the FDC service, and a maximum of 40 subsidised hours to the CBDC service. This will result in CCS being paid for 60 of the 72 fortnightly hours at the FDC service, and all 40 hours per fortnight at the CBDC service (where the individual's out-of-pocket costs are higher). There will be 12 hours per fortnight (6 hours per week) that will not be subsidised at the FDC service. The family will be required to pay full fees for these hours.

Where an individual does not elect how their subsidised hours are to be apportioned, the child care services will be paid up to the limit of the individual's subsidised hours available, according to the order in which the session reports (

1.1.S.35

) are received.

In the example above, if the individual did not elect how their subsidised hours were to be paid and both child care services submitted session reports weekly, both the FDC and CBDC service would be paid for all hours submitted in the first week of the CCS fortnight (36 and 20 hours, respectively, 56 hours in total). The individual would have 44 of the 100 hours of subsidised care remaining for the second week of the fortnight. If the FDC service submitted its session report for the second week before the CBDC service, CCS would be paid for all 36 hours used in FDC for that week, leaving 8 subsidised hours remaining. When the CBDC service submitted their session report for the second week, only 8 of the 20 hours would be subsidised.

1.1.R.22 Relationship parent/child

Definition

If someone is a child of an individual within the meaning of the

Family Law Act 1975

and they are not a biological or adopted child of the individual, then the child is the 'relationship child' of the individual and the individual is the 'relationship parent' of the child. The situations in the Family Law Act where someone is a child of a person, but is not a biological or adopted child of that person, include:

children born as a result of artificial conception procedures

children of de facto partners, and

children born under surrogacy arrangements.

The same provisions also apply to a parent or grandparent of a relationship parent of the child.

1.1.P.72 Payer (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, the payer is a parent who must pay child support to the payee (

1.1.P.71

) of a child. The parent must be the child's natural or adoptive parent or otherwise a 'parent' under the

Family Law Act 1975

.

A payer may have contact with the child, or share the care of the child with the payee.

It is important to note that a partner or former partner of a parent of the child is not automatically considered to be a 'payer' for the purposes of FTB. However, any payments or benefits received from a partner or former partner of a parent of the child, for the upkeep of that FTB child, are considered to be maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

).

History

Before 1 July 2008, payers were referred to as 'non-resident parents' and before the Family Law Reform changes in 1996, they were known as 'non-custodial parents'.

1.1.C.47 Common law right to receive less (FTB)

Definition

Individuals (

1.1.I.90

) have a common law right to choose to receive less than their full entitlement to

FA

(

1.1.F.02

) payments. This choice is voluntary. Individuals may only choose to receive less for the purpose of avoiding an overpayment of

FTB

.

Exercising this common law right does not affect the amount the individual is eligible for or entitled to under the FA legislation. If the individual chooses to receive less than their full entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) during the financial year, they may still be assessed for their full legislative entitlement at reconciliation, when their actual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is known.

Exercising this common law right does not affect other benefits such as eligibility to a

HCC

and/or

RA

. Entitlement to these benefits is based on the individual's legislative rate (

1.1.L.25

).

1.2.11 Single income family supplement (SIFS) - description

Summary

SIFS

provides assistance of up to $300 a year for families with a main income earner who earns between $68,000 and $150,000.

SIFS is paid to individuals who have a qualifying child (

2.11.2

) and where the main income earner has a taxable income of between $68,000 and $150,000. If there is a secondary earner in the family, their income needs to be below $18,000.

ACO

s are not eligible for the SIFS.

All individuals who receive

FTB

will be automatically assessed for SIFS eligibility without the need for a specific claim. These individuals will only be assessed for SIFS (

6.7

) after FTB reconciliation (

6.4

) which occurs at the end of the income year following the lodgement of tax returns by the individual and/or their partner/s.

Individuals who are not eligible to receive the SIFS payment with their FTB or are not in receipt of FTB, but who have a qualifying child (

2.11.2

) may submit a claim (

4.14

) at the conclusion of the relevant financial year for assessment under the SIFS review and payment process (

6.7

).

Note:

Rules governing payment of SIFS are similar to rules governing payment of FTB, with the exception of the following:

SIFS is not paid in fortnightly instalments

SIFS is determined on taxable income only (

1.1.T.20

) (not adjusted taxable income or an income estimate)

SIFS is not paid for a partnered period until both their and their partners (including ex-partners) taxable income is known (

6.4.4.20

).

Note:

On 1 July 2017, SIFS closed to new recipients. Grandfathering arrangements permit eligible recipients with entitlement to SIFS at 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS as long as they remain eligible for the payment. See

2.1.3.40 Immunisation - approved exemptions (FTB)

Summary

This topic explains the approved exemptions for an individual to meet the immunisation requirements for

FTB

Part A (

2.1.3.10

).

The evidence required to determine whether an individual has an exemption from immunisation requirements is outlined later in this topic.

Note:

Between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2015, different approved exemptions were applied to

FA

payments (

8.1.2

).

The following recognised immunisation providers (

1.1.R.09

) are eligible to certify that a child is medically contraindicated or that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity:

a general practitioner (

1.1.G.12

)

a paediatrician

a public health physician

an infectious diseases physician, or

a clinical immunologist.

Approved exemptions from immunisation

A child has an approved exemption from FTB Part A immunisation requirements where:

the child has a medical contraindication

the child has natural immunity

the child is a part of an approved vaccine study

the vaccine is temporarily unavailable

the child is vaccinated overseas, or

the Secretary has determined that the child meets the immunisation requirements.

Medical contraindication

Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has a medical contraindication to vaccination. The certification of a medical contraindication must be made in the form and manner and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink. A certification of a medical contraindication must be made through the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) site or on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) Immunisation medical exemption form (

IM011

).

Example:

A child who suffers from anaphylaxis following a previous dose of the relevant vaccine. If so, a recognised immunisation provider may certify that immunisation is medically contraindicated on the approved form.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Natural immunity

Only recognised immunisation providers listed above are eligible to certify that a child does not require immunisation because the child has developed a natural immunity. The certification of natural immunity must be made in the form and manner and be accompanied by any documents required by Centrelink. The certification of natural immunity must be made through the AIR site or on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) Immunisation medical exemption form (IM011).

Generally, a natural immunity exemption will only be applied to a specific antigen (not the whole schedule). A natural immunity exemption should be applied for life (based on the clinical assessment of a recognised immunisation provider).

Example:

A child who has previously contracted measles may have developed a natural immunity to contracting the disease again and therefore, does not need to be immunised against measles again.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Approved vaccine study

A child meets the immunisation requirements if the child is a participant in a vaccine study approved by a Human Research Ethics Committee registered with the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(3) Medical contraindication, natural immunity and vaccine study

Temporary unavailability of vaccine

Where a child is not vaccinated as required and the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that the relevant vaccine/s (or all vaccines) are temporarily unavailable, the child is considered to meet the immunisation requirements, provided the child has received all other relevant vaccinations. A child meets the immunisation requirements on this basis only until such time as the vaccine becomes available.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(4) Temporary unavailability of vaccine

Children vaccinated overseas

A child who was vaccinated in another country meets the immunisation requirements if a recognised immunisation provider certifies in writing that the vaccinations have provided the child with the same level of immunisation that the child would have acquired under the Australian childhood schedule (birth to 4 years), and records this information on the AIR.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 6(5) Child vaccinated overseas

Secretary may determine a child meets immunisation requirements

The table below details circumstances where the Secretary can determine a child meets the immunisation requirements:

Exception/exemption

Circumstances

Refusal of consent to vaccination

the child is in the care of an individual under a state or territory child welfare law and neither the individual nor their partner has legal authority to make decisions about the medical treatment of the child, and

if the child is aged under 14 years, the person with legal authority to make decisions about the medical treatment of the child has refused or failed within a reasonable time, to provide consent to the individual taking actions to enable the child to meet the immunisation requirements, or

if the child is aged at least 14 years, the child has refused, or failed within a reasonable time, to provide consent to the individual taking actions to enable the child to meet the usual immunisation requirements.

Risk of family violence

taking action to meet the immunisation requirements would result in the child, the individual who has care of the child, or a member of the immediate family of the individual or the child being at risk of family violence.

Permanent humanitarian visa holder

the individual is a permanent humanitarian visa holder and has not had the opportunity to immunise their child.

Note:

An exemption under this category can only be applied for a maximum of 6 months after the child first enters Australia.

Unacceptable risk of harm to child or another person

a listed medical practitioner (

1.1.L.28

) has certified in writing that immunisation of the child would result in an unacceptable risk of physical harm to the child or a person administering a vaccination to the child, and

the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that they agree with the listed medical practitioner.

FTB immunisation requirements

Evidence required to determine exception/exemption

The table below explains the required evidence to determine whether an individual has an exemption from immunisation.

Exception/exemption

Evidence required

Medical contraindication

Natural immunity

Medical contraindication or natural immunity certified by a recognised immunisation provider through the AIR site or on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) Immunisation medical exemption form (IM011).

Approved vaccine study

Temporary unavailability of vaccine

The Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer must certify in writing that a vaccine, or all vaccines are temporarily unavailable.

Child vaccinated overseas

Overseas vaccinations recorded on the AIR by a recognised immunisation provider who has determined that that the overseas vaccinations have provided the child with the same level of immunisation that the child would have acquired under the Australian childhood schedule (birth to 4 years).

Refusal of consent to vaccination

Proof of care arrangements:

FTB - evidence of the child welfare law (for example, state or territory child protection order), and

if the child is aged under 14 years:

evidence that the individual with legal authority to vaccinate the child does not give authority for the child to be vaccinated, or evidence that authority has not been provided within a reasonable timeframe (for example, statutory declaration from carer and letter from authority that the person with legal authority has not provided consent), or

if the child is aged 14 years or over:

evidence that the child does not consent or has not given consent in a reasonable timeframe to being immunised (for example, statutory declaration from carer or a letter from a recognised immunisation provider that the child has refused).

Risk of family violence

Individuals must be referred to a Centrelink social worker and each case will be assessed on a case by case basis. Applicable documentation is to be determined by the Centrelink social worker.

Permanent humanitarian visa holder

evidence of the child's date of entry into Australia being less than 6 months in the past.

Note:

The individual may also have evidence that they intend to have their child immunised or put on a catch up schedule according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook (for example, evidence of an appointment with a recognised immunisation provider).

Unacceptable risk of harm to child or a person administering the vaccination

A listed medical practitioner has certified in writing, on an approved form, that immunisation of the child would result in an unacceptable risk of physical harm to the child or a person administering a vaccination to the child, and

the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer has certified in writing that they agree with the listed medical practitioner.

Note:

A recipient can seek referral to a listed medical practitioner through a general practitioner or a state or territory health department.

3.1.5.10 Summary of the maintenance action test

Summary

This topic provides an introduction to the

MAT

. It includes:

requirement to take reasonable action for maintenance

(

1.1.M.10

)

maintenance and child support

(

1.1.C.20

)

Child Support Scheme (CSS)

, and

progress of maintenance action.

The MAT is applied in the same way for instalment claims (

1.1.I.100

) and past period claims (

1.1.P.60

) for

FTB

.

Requirement to take reasonable action for maintenance

An individual is required to take reasonable maintenance action for a child if they are entitled to apply for maintenance (

3.1.5.25

) for the child and the Secretary considers that it is reasonable that they should take this action. This requirement also applies to the individual's current partner (

1.1.P.30

) if the partner is entitled to apply for maintenance for the child. If either the individual or the partner, if applicable, fails to meet this requirement, only the base rate (

1.1.B.15

) of FTB Part A is payable in respect of the child and the child is not included for

RA

purposes.

An individual who is a payer in a child support case is not required to seek maintenance for the child for whom they pay child support as they are already taking reasonable action.

Explanation:

Action for maintenance may not be applicable, or an exemption may be granted.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 10 Effect of certain maintenance rights

Maintenance & child support

For FTB purposes, maintenance refers to both spousal maintenance and child maintenance. Child support refers only to child maintenance. For the purposes of the FTB MAT, only action for child maintenance relating to an FTB child is relevant. Action for spousal maintenance is not required; however any spousal maintenance received by the individual is assessable under the maintenance income test.

Any maintenance received by an individual or their partner is assessed under the maintenance income test. An individual who receives maintenance has more total income, even if their rate of FTB Part A is reduced by the maintenance income test. The individual may continue to receive child support until their child turns 18 years or upon application, until their child finishes secondary school in the year they turn 18, regardless of whether they continue to receive FTB.

CSS

The CSS was introduced in 2 stages. Stage 1 was implemented from 1 June 1988 under the

CSRC Act

. Stage 2 was implemented from 1 October 1989 under the

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

. The scheme placed an obligation on eligible parents to financially support their children. Child Support was created to enforce this legislation. Before the introduction of the CSS, child support could only be obtained if the parents reached an agreement, or by getting an order from a court.

The requirements for maintenance action under each stage are different. The appropriate stage is worked out based on the individual's circumstances.

3.2.1 Adjusted taxable income - general provisions

Summary

This topic provides general information about

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) and includes:

what is ATI

estimates provided by the individual

indexed current estimates -

FTB

&

CCS

only

indexed actual income - FTB & CCS only

treatment of income if the individual is a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

)

income year used for the assessment - FTB & CCS only

reasonable estimate of income (

1.1.I.20

), and

income to be used when an individual dies during an income year.

What is ATI

ATI is used in the FTB, CCS and

SBP

income tests when assessing an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) eligibility for these payments. While the income tests are different for FTB, CCS and SBP, the types of income used in the assessment are the same.

An individual's ATI is:

the sum of the following amounts for the relevant income year

taxable income (

3.2.2

)

adjusted fringe benefits total (

3.2.3

)

target foreign income (

3.2.4

)

total net investment losses (

3.2.5

)

tax free pension or benefit (

3.2.6

), and

reportable superannuation contributions (

3.2.9

), and

less 100% of the individual's

DCME

(

3.2.7

).

For FTB, Centrelink uses either:

an estimate provided by the individual and assessed as reasonable by Centrelink

the indexed current estimate, or

the indexed actual income, based on the previous year's taxable income.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 3 clause 1 Adjusted taxable income relevant to FTB, schoolkids bonus and CCS, Schedule 3 clause 2 Adjusted taxable income

Estimates provided by the individual

Individuals claiming FTB by fortnightly instalments or CCS are required to provide Centrelink with an initial estimate of their annual family income. Centrelink will ask individuals to provide a new income estimate for each subsequent year that they receive FTB by fortnightly instalments, and/or CCS, and to update their income estimate at any time if their income changes.

Individuals claiming SBP are required to provide Centrelink with an estimate of their family income for the 6-month period beginning on the day of the child's delivery.

Indexed current estimates - FTB & CCS only

If, having provided an initial income estimate, the individual chooses not to provide an estimate of their family income for a subsequent year, Centrelink will determine payment on the basis of an indexed estimate. The indexed estimate is worked out by adjusting the individual's most recent estimate by an indexation factor determined by movements in the average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.9

New financial year assessments

Indexed actual income - FTB & CCS only

If an individual's payments are determined on the basis of an indexed estimate, the indexed estimate may be subject to a second adjustment once the individual's actual income for the previous financial year becomes known. Centrelink will adjust the actual income by an indexation factor determined by movements in the average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period and compare the result with the indexed estimate. Payments will be based on the higher estimate amount for the rest of that income year.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

New financial year assessments

Treatment of income if the individual is a member of a couple

For the purposes of FTB Part A, if an individual is a member of a couple, their ATI for a tax year includes their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) ATI for that year. The same rule applies for the 6-month period beginning on the day of the child's delivery for SBP.

For the purposes of FTB Part B, if the individual is a member of a couple, only the ATI of the lower income earner (

1.1.L.40

) is used to calculate the rate of FTB Part B (noting that the primary earner's income must be below the primary income earner limit to attract any FTB Part B).

Example:

William and Erica receive FTB Part A and FTB Part B. William is self-employed and has an ATI of $5,500 per year and Erica has an ATI of $45,500 per year. Erica works part-time and is the primary carer (

1.1.P.120

) of the children. Their entitlement to FTB Part A and CCS is worked out using their combined income of $51,000. Their entitlement to FTB Part B is calculated on William's income of $5,500 a year. This is because William is the lower income earner.

For the purposes of CCS, if an individual is a member of a couple for part or all of a tax year, their ATI for the tax year includes their partner's ATI for that year for the period they were a couple. If an individual was a member of a couple from the beginning of the CCS year for the duration of the year, their ATI includes their partner's ATI for that year. If an individual become a member of a couple part way through the CCS year, their own ATI is used for the period they were single. Their partner's ATI is included as part of their ATI for the period they were a couple.

Act reference:

3.1.1.20

Current FTB rates & income test amounts

Income year used for the assessment - FTB & CCS only

The income used to assess an individual's FTB or CCS eligibility is the income for the year to which the claim relates. Where an individual claims a payment in the current income year, they must make a reasonable estimate of their income for that year.

Reasonable estimate of income

If the individual has estimated their family income, Centrelink must determine if the estimate is reasonable. If it is determined by Centrelink that the estimate is not reasonable, the individual has no entitlement to receive FTB by instalment or CCS. The individual may still be eligible for FTB after the end of the financial year or CCS after the end of the current or following financial year when their actual ATI is known.

1.2.8.20 Variations to FTB advance repayment period

Introduction

The original repayment period (

1.1.O.30

) for an

FTB

advance (

1.2.8

) is usually 182 days. However, the repayment period can be varied or suspended upon a request from the individual. The advance repayment period may also be less than 182 days due to a discretionary exception (

3.1.11

). In addition, the repayment period (

1.1.R.33

) may be extended due to a recalculation of FTB Part A for a prior repayment period. Where the repayment of a notional 'new advance' commences following the discovery of an unrepaid amount of an old advance the original repayment period for the new advance may be different than 182 days.

This topic provides detailed information on variations to FTB advance repayment periods due to:

recalculation of FTB Part A for a prior repayment period resulting in a notional new advance

variation to FTB Part A rate during repayment period

increased repayments

reduced repayments/suspended repayments, and

additional repayments.

Recalculation of FTB Part A for a prior repayment period & new advances

If it is retrospectively determined for a previous period that an individual's FTB Part A rate before reduction for an advance was insufficient to satisfy the advance rate reduction for that period, this will result in an unrepaid amount of the advance. Such a retrospective determination can be made because of a reconciliation outcome or the individual advising of a change of circumstances outside of the required notification period (

1.1.N.40

). If such a determination is made and at that time the repayment period for the advance has NOT expired and the individual remains legislatively entitled in the current income year to FTB Part A instalments, then no advance debt for the unrepaid amount should arise. Instead, the repayment period for this advance will be extended, retaining the existing reduction amount for the advance.

If the repayment period for the advance HAS expired and the individual remains legislatively entitled in the current income year to FTB Part A instalments, no advance debt will arise. In this case, the old advance is taken to be repaid and a notional new advance is taken to have been paid to the individual equal to the unrepaid amount of the original 'old advance'. The new advance is then repaid by reduction of the individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate, generally at the standard reduction amount for the original old advance.

An individual is not entitled to a further advance where they have not fully repaid a previous advance payment granted more than 12 months before the new advance assessment day. This includes where an old advance is being repaid as a NOTIONAL new advance. (The date of the notional new advance is not relevant in determining an individual’s entitlement to a further advance.)

To determine the further advance amount an individual is entitled to, the original old advance amount is deducted from the individual’s maximum advance entitlement (not the new notional advance).

If no ongoing legislative entitlement to FTB Part A exists, the unrepaid amount will be raised as an FTB advance debt. If an unrepaid amount arises due to a non-lodger determination, specific FTB advance debt rules apply (

6.4.3.30

).

Example:

Sam has a maximum $500 advance, and receives a $300 advance which is fully repaid after 182 days. A subsequent retrospective reassessment identifies an unrepaid amount of $100. A notional new advance of $100 is taken to be paid to Sam as a result of this reassessment. During the repayment period for the notional new advance, Sam requests a new one-off advance. The maximum advance Sam is now eligible for is her maximum advance amount ($500) minus the full amount of any advance not yet repaid ($300 - that is, the full amount of the original advance). Sam's maximum advance when the new one-off advance is requested is therefore $200 ($500 - $300). If Sam had requested the one-off new advance more than 12 months after the original advance was paid, she would not have been eligible for the second advance regardless of when the notional advance was paid. If Sam was not currently entitled to FTB Part A when her FTB was reassessed, an FTB advance debt would have been raised.

Where an unrepaid advance is retrospectively determined and a notional new advance is deemed to have been paid so as to enable repayment from ongoing FTB Part A instalments, the recommencement of the FTB Part A reduction from instalment payments depends on the existence and timing of any other advances previously paid. Priority is given to repaying advances where the reduction is already being applied to ongoing FTB Part A payments. Therefore:

If …

then …

an unrepaid advance amount is determined and the reduction in FTB Part A for this advance has not ended (i.e. the advance is still being repaid)

the reduction for this advance will continue at the existing reduction amount by extending the repayment period.

an advance is initially fully repaid, but subsequently determined as unrepaid and the individual's FTB Part A rate is not currently being reduced due to any other advance

a notional new advance will be created and repayment of the notional new advance will generally re-commence from the beginning of the first instalment period for which it is practicable to reduce the individual's FTB Part A rate.

an advance is initially fully repaid, but subsequently determined as unrepaid and the individual's FTB Part A rate is currently being reduced due to another later advance granted before the original advance was fully repaid

a notional new advance will be created and repayment of the notional new advance will re-commence from the beginning of the first instalment period for which it is practicable to reduce the individual's FTB Part A rate (meaning that the individual's FTB Part A rate will be reduced to repay both advances concurrently).

an advance is initially fully repaid, but subsequently determined as unrepaid and the individual's FTB Part A rate is currently being reduced due to another later advance granted after the original advance was initially fully repaid

a notional new advance will be created and repayment of the other later advance will be given priority. The reduction of FTB Part A to repay the notional new advance will generally not re-commence until immediately after the other later advance is fully repaid. Repayment of the new advance may begin earlier if the concurrent repayment of advances would not cause severe financial hardship.

(subject to conditions above) there is more than one advance which is initially fully repaid, but subsequently determined as unrepaid, and the unrepaid advances previously had overlapping repayment periods

notional new advances will be created and the reduction in FTB Part A for these notional new advances will generally re-commence from the beginning of the first instalment period for which it is practicable to reduce the individual's FTB Part A rate (meaning that the individual's FTB Part A rate may be reduced to repay multiple advances concurrently).

(subject to conditions above) there is more than one advance which is initially fully repaid, but subsequently determined not to have been repaid, and the unrepaid advances previously did not have overlapping repayment periods

notional new advances will be created and the reduction in FTB Part A for the notional new advance whose original advance is the older will re-commence from the beginning of the first instalment period for which it is practicable to reduce the individual's FTB Part A rate. Any FTB Part A reduction for the other notional new advance whose original advance is younger will generally not recommence until immediately after the older advance is fully repaid. However, repayment of the younger advance may begin earlier if the concurrent repayment of advances would not cause severe financial hardship.

In some cases, repayments may have commenced for a notional new advance to recover an unrepaid amount, or an advance repayment period may have been extended, as described above. If subsequently it is determined that the unrepaid amount was, in fact, paid in part or in full, any amount that was over-repaid as a consequence of the original decision should be paid to the individual as immediate arrears of FTB Part A.

Example:

Michelle requests an advance and a $364 advance is determined on 15 June 2012 and reduction of Michelle's FTB Part A commences on 20 June 2012 at $2 per day. The advance is fully repaid on 18 December 2012. Michelle (and her partner) then lodge their tax returns and on 1 September 2013 and it is determined that there was no entitlement during the 2012-13 year due to their combined

ATI

being too high, so the reductions between 1 July and 18 December 2012 ($2 × 171 days = $342) did not actually occur. As Michelle has ongoing entitlement to FTB, the unrepaid amount of $342 then becomes a notional new advance and repayments commence at $2 per for a repayment period of 171 days from 11 September 2013 to 28 February 2014, and the advance is again fully repaid. On 1 April 2014, the

ATO

sends amended income details for Michelle for the 2012-13 year and she was actually entitled to their full rate of payment for the 1 July to 18 December 2012 period. Therefore the advance repayments during this period did actually occur. As the notional new advance of $342 was created and repaid incorrectly, the earlier determination of the notional new advance is revoked, and the $342 underpayment of FTB Part A is paid to the Michelle as immediate arrears of FTB Part A.

Example:

Melissa requests an advance, and a $728 advance is determined on 29 December 2011 (with the repayment period running from 3 January to 2 July 2012 at an FTB Part A reduction of $4 per day. But on 1 May 2012 it is discovered that Melissa's FTB Part A rate before reduction for the period 3 January to 22 January was only $2 per day. The difference ($2 × 20 days = $40) then causes the repayment period to be extended by 10 days ($40 ÷ $4 = 10 days). Therefore, at the end of 12 July 2012, the advance is fully repaid. Then on 1 August 2012 it is discovered that the alteration to Melissa's rate during the 3 to 22 January 2012 period was incorrect and her rate was actually above $4 per day, meaning that the standard reduction of $4 per day was actually applied. Therefore, the extension of the repayment period for the 3 to 12 July 2012 period was incorrect, and the $40 underpayment of FTB Part A during this period is paid to Melissa as immediate arrears.

Where an individual is entitled to FTB Part A arrears which cover an advance repayment period (

1.1.R.33

), the arrears should not be reduced to offset the outstanding advance balance. However, in some situations the legislative rate of FTB Part A arrears payable to the individual are affected by the presence of the advance. These situations include where the arrears arise as a result of:

a change in the FTB payment delivery date, or

a restoration of FTB Part A following a suspension or cancellation.

In these situations, the rate reduction applied to the arrears is equivalent to the amount that payments would have otherwise been reduced to repay the advance if the suspension/cancellation/change of payment delivery date had not occurred.

Entitlement to FTB advance payment

Variation to FTB Part A rate during repayment period

If an individual receives an FTB advance and their ongoing FTB Part A rate before the advance reduction decreases to below the advance repayment rate, the Secretary must increase the length of the repayment period. By doing so, the repayment rate for the advance will decrease to an amount that is equal to or less than the individual's FTB Part A rate before the advance repayment (that is, the individual's entire FTB Part A payment will be used to repay the advance). If the Secretary determines that the resulting repayment period will become unreasonably lengthy they may raise a debt for the unrepaid amount (

7.6

) instead.

If the individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate before the advance repayment is below the standard reduction and subsequently increases, the Secretary may then decrease the number of days in the repayment period. However, the reduction of the individual's FTB Part A rate must not be more than the standard reduction. Increasing the repayment amount above the standard reduction should only occur upon request from the individual as described below.

Where the individual is currently repaying multiple advances, the advances are approached one by one, taking the oldest advance first, and working through to the youngest. The reduction is adjusted individually because reductions for older advances may result in a nil FTB Part A rate, such that payment of a younger advance cannot occur at that time. In this instance, there is the capacity for the Secretary to suspend the repayment for such younger advances.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 43 Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction-single FTB advance, Schedule 1 clause 44 Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction-multiple FTB advances, Schedule 1 clause 45 Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction-discretion to create FTB advance debt

Increased repayments (decreasing the length of the repayment period)

An individual may request that the Secretary decrease the number of days in the repayment period which may result in the repayments for an FTB advance increasing to above the standard reduction. The Secretary must be satisfied that the increased repayments will not cause the individual financial hardship.

If an individual elects to increase the rate reduction following receipt of an FTB advance, but their ongoing FTB Part A rate before the reduction decreases to below the nominated higher reduction amount, the individual's entire FTB Part A payment will be reduced to nil to recover the FTB advance. If the individual's FTB Part A rate before the FTB advance reduction, then increases, the Secretary will only increase the advance reduction back to the standard reduction. This means that if the FTB Part A rate goes below the standard reduction, then increases, the advance repayment can return to the standard reduction, but not above. If the individual wishes to return to the higher reduction rate, they will need to request it again and meet the conditions as above.

Example:

Iain receives an FTB advance with a standard reduction of $2.197 per day. He later requests to increase the repayments by decreasing the length of the repayment period, making his daily advance repayment $4.00. During the repayment period, Iain's daily FTB Part A rate before the advance repayment reduces to $1.50 per day. As a result, the Secretary extends the repayment period to make the new daily repayment amount $1.50, which is Iain's entire FTB Part A payment. A subsequent change occurs during the repayment period and Iain's FTB Part A rate before the advance repayment increases to $4.20 per day. As a result, the Secretary increases Iain's advance repayment back to the standard reduction of $2.197 per day. If Iain wishes to return to the increased repayment amount of $4.00 per day, he must lodge a new request.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 43 Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction-single FTB advance, Schedule 1 clause 44 Part A rate insufficient to cover reduction-multiple FTB advances, Schedule 1 clause 46 Changing the repayment period-individual requests shorter period

Reduced repayments (increasing the length of the repayment period)/suspended repayments

An individual may request to reduce the repayments for an FTB advance below the standard reduction by increasing the number of days in the repayment period. Repayments will be reduced if the individual's circumstances are special and could not reasonably have been foreseen at the time of requesting the FTB advance, and they would suffer severe financial hardship if the current reduction were to continue for the repayment period.

An individual may also seek to suspend the repayment of an FTB advance. To suspend the individual's repayments, their circumstances would generally be more serious than those of an individual whose repayments are reduced.

Example:

Where an individual is imminently at risk of becoming homeless they may seek to suspend the repayment of their FTB advance.

Prior to approving the suspension of an individual's advance repayments, consideration is given as to whether reducing the repayments (as above) would be sufficient to alleviate the hardship the individual is experiencing. Where reduced repayments are sufficient, approval for suspension should generally not be granted. Suspending repayments has the effect of deferring the point at which the FTB advance is fully repaid.

The decision about whether to reduce or whether to suspend repayments should take into account the severity of the individual's circumstances on a case by case basis. A reduced or suspended repayment arrangement is only approved for a temporary period based on an estimate of when the individual's circumstances will return to normal. However, these arrangements are reviewed every 3 months as a minimum to avoid individuals remaining on reduced or suspended repayments longer than needed. An individual may not be granted further FTB advance payments (including regular advances) if reduced or suspended repayments currently apply to an existing advance.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 35A Entitlement to FTB advance

Additional repayments

While reduction of the individual's FTB Part A rate will be the general method for repaying an FTB advance (including capacity to seek increased repayments), there is also the capacity to repay the FTB advance by another method that is acceptable to both the individual and the Secretary (for example, a cash repayment). In general, when an individual requests that a portion of an FTB advance balance be repaid by a method other than a reduction in their ongoing FTB Part A instalments, it is taken that the individual also requested that the repayment period for the FTB advance is reduced, so as to maintain the same FTB part A reduction amount that was in place prior to the additional repayment.

1.1.H.05 Healthy start for school child health check

Summary

If an individual or their partner receives an income support payment on any day that the individual is also receiving

FTB

Part A, and they have an FTB child that turns 4 in that income year, an age-appropriate health check (

2.1.3.70

) must be undertaken or the FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

).

Further detail can be found in

2.1.3.50

.

Note:

From 1 July 2018, a recognised health check must be completed and Centrelink must be notified before the day the FTB child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's 6th birthday). If special circumstances prevented the health check from being completed in time, an application for an extension may be made after the child turns 5, but must be made before the child turns 6.

Prior to the 2017-18 income year, individuals were required to complete a recognised health check and notify Centrelink, or provide details of special circumstances which prevented the health check being done, by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) for the income year in which the child turned 4.

Prior to the 2012-13 income year, individuals had 2 years after the income year in which the child turned 4 to meet the requirements.

3.1.6.40 Child support assessments

Summary

This topic describes the requirements for obtaining, reviewing and ending a child support assessment.

Eligibility for a child support assessment

An application for an administrative assessment for child support for a child may be made to the Child Support Registrar if the child is:

an eligible child

under 18 years when the claim is made

not a member of a couple, and

one or more of the following

in Australia (

1.1.A.120

) on the day the application is made

an Australian citizen, or

ordinarily reside in Australia on the day the application is made.

The child cannot apply for a child support assessment on their own behalf.

Where the eligible child will be in full-time secondary study on or after their 18th birthday the carer entitled to child support can seek an extension of a child support assessment until the last day of the secondary school year in which the child turns 18, as long as the request is made before the child turns 18 and the child is in full-time secondary study on their 18th birthday. This action must occur for the individual in this situation to satisfy the

MAT

for their child.

If a child is eligible for child support assessment, the payee (

1.1.P.71

) cannot get a court order for child support from the payer, unless an assessment has been made first.

Exception:

The payee may seek an interim order, which has effect until the assessment is made.

Any individual with an eligible child may apply for assessment, whether or not they are a parent or receiving family assistance.

1.1.F.57 FTB child rate

Definition

The

FTB

child rate is the maximum rate of FTB Part A payable for a child according to their age before the income and maintenance income tests are applied to an individual's payment.

When a child turns 13, the FTB child rate increases to reflect the additional costs associated with dependent children in this age group.

The FTB child rate is base rate when:

the individual or their partner does not take reasonable maintenance action (

3.1.5

) in respect of the child

the individual or their partner receive a periodic payment under the law of the Commonwealth that provides an increased rate in respect of the child, or

the individual or their partner is receiving a periodic payment under a scheme administered by the Commonwealth that provides an increased rate in respect of the child.

Where a shared care determination is made in respect of an FTB child, the FTB child rate is the shared care percentage of the FTB child rate that would otherwise apply.

Note:

Where a child does not meet the immunisation or health check requirements (

2.1.3

), the FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

). For past period claims the FTB child rate may be reduced as a lump sum.

individuals (

1.1.I.90

) is to ensure that CCS individuals and individuals who receive their FTB entitlements through Centrelink as fortnightly instalments are assessed against their current circumstances, including an estimate of their annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

).

New financial year assessment (NFYA)

Centrelink contacts individuals between April and May of each year by a written notice. The notice requests that the individual provide an estimate of their, and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

), ATI for the new financial year.

The NFYA letter provides the individual with 2 options to estimate their income:

the individual can provide their own estimated ATI, or

accept an indexed income estimate determined by Centrelink. The indexed estimate (or indexed actual income, where applicable) is calculated by indexing the individual's most recent estimate by movement in the average weekly earnings.

Note:

If an individual fails to respond to the NFYA letter, their rate of FTB, and/or CCS percentage, will be assessed using the indexed estimate amount advised in the letter. If an individual chooses to accept the indexed estimate as provided by Centrelink, or if the indexed estimate is applied by default (because the individual fails to respond), a second indexation process may occur when the individual's actual ATI becomes known. Centrelink will index the individual and/or their partner's actual ATI (as provided by the

ATO

) by movements in the average weekly earnings. The indexed actual ATI will then be compared to the indexed estimate and the higher amount will be used to determine the individual's FTB rate, and/or CCS percentage.

Through the NYFA process, an estimate of income is ascertained and used to determine an individual's rate of FTB, and/or CCS percentage, from the beginning of the new financial year. In addition, CCS individuals are contacted in June and advised of their CCS percentages for the current financial year and the next financial year.

New FTB claims following the NFYA process

Individuals who make a new claim for FTB by instalments between the issuing of NFYA letters and the end of the current financial year will be provided with a NFYA letter when granted payment. The letter advises of the estimated income amount that will be used to determine the individual's FTB rate in the new financial year. The individual should be encouraged to provide their own estimate at all times. Where the individual is unable to provide an estimate for the new financial year but provides an estimate for the current year, Centrelink indexes the amount and advises the individual of the estimate upon which their payment will be made in the new financial year following the usual notification rules. The individual is given the option to accept the Centrelink estimate or to provide their own estimate for the new financial year.

FTB recipients included in the NFYA process

All FTB instalment recipients, except single income support recipients and individuals who have already provided a new financial year estimate at the time of the assessment, are contacted as part of the NFYA process.

Explanation:

Single income support recipients are not contacted as part of the FTB NFYA process because they are not subject to the FTB income test and therefore receive the maximum rates of FTB Part A and FTB Part B. They may be issued a NFYA letter if they are a CCS recipient.

3.1.9.20 Income test - FTB Part B

FTB

Part B income tests

The following table outlines the income tests that applyr to different individual's circumstances.

If the Individual is …

then …

a single parent

they are eligible for the maximum rate of FTB Part B if their income is equal to or below the primary earner income limit (

1.1.I.45

).

the higher income earner in a couple

the primary income earner limit applies and the rate of FTB Part B will depend on the income of the lower income earner.

the lower income earner in the couple

Explanation:

It does not matter if the lower income earner is not the primary carer of the children.

Example:

Damien and Genevieve receive FTB Part B. Damien is self-employed and earns $7,500 and Genevieve earns $25,500 per year. Genevieve works part-time and is the primary carer of the children. FTB Part B is calculated on Damien's income of $7,500 as he is the lower income earner even though Genevieve is the primary carer.

if their partner's income is equal to or lower than the primary income earner limit, an income test then applies to the lower earner's income to determine the rate of FTB Part B. Their FTB Part B is reduced by 20% of the income excess if their

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is more than their income free area (

1.1.I.40

).

Explanation:

This amount is deducted from the maximum rate. The remaining amount is the individual's FTB Part B rate.

Special arrangements may apply to lower income earners in a couple returning to work for the first time after the birth of a child (

3.1.9.30

), or when an eligible child enters their care.

For information on how FTB Part A and FTB Part B are exempt from the income test for ATI for periods during the relevant income year (

2.8.2.30 ACCS (grandparent) - calculation of shared care arrangements

Summary

This topic outlines how the percentage of care is determined for

ACCS

(grandparent) where there is a shared care arrangement.

ACCS (grandparent) calculation of shared care arrangements

Where there is a shared care arrangement, the calculation of the percentage arrangement will generally follow the Services Australia care determination method of calculating shared care arrangements.

Example:

Marion and Damien share the care of their grandchild Justin with their daughter, Mandy. Marion and Damien take care of Justin 5 nights a week and Justin returns to his mother for the weekend. This arrangement is formalised in a court order and is in place until Justin turns 18 years old.

Marion or Damien will be eligible for ACCS (grandparent), as long as:

this court order is in place

Justin attends child care, and

they remain on an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

).

The calculation of shared care arrangement follows the Services Australia care determination method.

The percentage of care for ACCS (grandparent) may not always follow the percentage established for

FTB

purposes. This may happen in some cases, where the shared care arrangements may be irregular and/or chaotic. Irregular and unpredictable care on an ongoing basis can still meet the eligibility requirements for ACCS (grandparent). This is because whether or not the grandparent was eligible for ACCS (grandparent) in one fortnight has no direct impact on whether they are eligible in another fortnight.

2.8.2.10 ACCS (grandparent) - eligibility

Summary

This topic explains the eligibility requirements for

ACCS

(grandparent) and covers:

ACCS (grandparent) eligibility requirements

principal care

65% of ongoing daily care

substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development

what is not considered principal care

ACCS (grandparent) income support payments (

1.1.I.50

)

grandparent carers who do not meet the eligibility requirements for ACCS (grandparent).

ACCS (grandparent) eligibility requirements

To be eligible for ACCS (grandparent) an individual (

1.1.I.90

) (or their partner (

1.1.P.30

)) must:

meet the eligibility requirements for the

CCS

be the grandparent or great-grandparent of the child

be the principal carer of the child by providing all or at least 65% of ongoing daily care and having substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development

receive an income support payment from Services Australia or

DVA

.

An individual must meet the ACCS (grandparent) eligibility requirements at the start of a CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) in which a session of care (

1.1.S.40

) is provided.

Principal care

For a grandparent to be assessed as the principal carer of their grandchild, they must:

provide all or at least 65% of ongoing daily care for the child, and

have substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development.

65% of ongoing daily care

An individual needs to meet 65% care at the start of the CCS fortnight in which the session of care is provided. The percentage of care does not need to be spread equally between the CCS fortnight as long as the fortnight average is 65%.

Example:

A grandparent meets 65% if they care for the child 5 out of 7 nights per week (5/7 = approximately 72%).

Example:

A grandparent does not meet 65% if they care for the child 4 out of 7 nights per week: (4/7 days= approximately 58%).

Example:

A grandparent meets 65% if they care for the child 10 out of 14 nights per fortnight: (10/14 days= approximately 72%).

Example

: A grandparent does not meet 65% if they care for the child 8 out of 14 nights per fortnight: (8/14 days= approximately 58%).

Where there is a regular shared care arrangement, the calculation of the percentage arrangement will follow the Services Australia care determination method on shared care arrangements.

Example:

Marion and Damien share the care of their grandchild Justin with their daughter, Mandy. Marion and Damien take care of Justin 5 nights a week and Justin returns to his mother for the weekend. This arrangement is formalised in a court order and is in place until Justin turns 18 years old.

Marion or Damien may be eligible for ACCS (grandparent) as long as:

this court order is in place

Justin attends child care, or

Marion or Damien remain on an income support payment.

The calculation of shared care arrangement follows the Services Australia care determination. When there is a change in those circumstances, such as a change in the court order, then a reassessment of the shared care arrangement would need to take place.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

5.2.1.50

ACCS - change of circumstances

Substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare & development

In addition to providing 65% of ongoing daily care, a grandparent must have substantial autonomy for the day-to-day decisions about the child's care, welfare and development. This means the grandparent generally has the power to make decisions without consulting with the child's parents (

1.1.P.10

), when the child is in the grandparent's care.

Example:

Elizabeth and Phillip are going on an overseas holiday for 4 weeks and are leaving Harry in the care of his maternal grandmother, Charlotte (who receives an income support payment). Harry's parents retain full authority for making decisions about Harry while they are overseas. Charlotte is not eligible for ACCS (grandparent).

In order to determine whether a grandparent has substantial autonomy for the child, the following factors may be considered:

Is the grandparent the emergency contact for the child at the school and child care service (

1.1.A.90

)?

Does the grandparent make decisions about the medical and dental treatment to be provided to the child?

Is the grandparent responsible for the day-to-day costs (food, accommodation, transport etc.) and long-term costs (school fees, clothing, healthcare)?

What is not considered principal care

In most cases, a grandparent will not be considered as the principal carer of the child if they reside in the same home as the biological parent.

If the grandparent is caring for the child whilst the parent is undertaking activities such as work or study, they are not regarded as having principal care, even if it is every day.

Example:

Tania is on an income support payment and looks after her grandson Jackson 5 days a week, while his parents Martha and Ben are at work. Each weekday, Martha drops off and picks up Jackson from Tania's house. As Martha and Robert retain all legal and financial responsibility for Jackson, Tania is not eligible for ACCS (grandparent).

It is not considered principal care where the grandparent cares for a child during the day and the child is with the parent at night.

Example:

John is an income support recipient who lives with his son Jacob, who is a shift worker, and granddaughter Charlotte. Charlotte attends after school care, and John cares for her overnight while Jacob is at work. If anything serious happens to Charlotte while Jacob is at work, John calls Jacob. Therefore, John is not Charlotte's principal carer so he is not eligible for ACCS in relation to Charlotte's after school care.

ACCS (grandparent) income support payments

To be eligible for ACCS (grandparent) an individual must be in receipt of an income support payment. An income support payment is any of the following:

age pension

austudy payment

carer payment

disability support pension

DSP

(blind)

DVA income support supplement or service pension

jobseeker payment

parenting payment

special benefit, or

youth allowance.

Grandparent carers who do not meet the eligibility requirements for ACCS (grandparent)

Grandparents who are the principal carer of their grandchild/ren who are not in receipt of an income support payment, may be entitled (

1.1.E.30

) to CCS if they meet the relevant eligibility criteria. They will be exempt from needing to report their recognised participation, and will be entitled to 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight, with the rate of subsidy based on the family's income (

1.1.I.20

).

Grandparents who are not the principal carers of their grandchild/ren but care for them between 14% and 64% of the time may be eligible for CCS if they meet the relevant eligibility criteria, with entitlement based on their income and recognised participation.

6.4.4.20 Reconciliation - ex-partners

Summary

This topic explains the treatment of ex-partners under the reconciliation process. The topic discusses the definition of ex-partner and situations where:

separation occurs during the relevant income year (year of entitlement)

separation occurs during the lodgement year

, and

separation occurs after the lodgement year.

Definition of ex-partner

For the purposes of reconciliation, an ex-partner is an individual with whom the individual was partnered for part or all of the claim period during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) but with whom they are no longer partnered. It applies to individuals who receive

FTB

by instalment payments and those individuals who have made a past period claim after the end of the income year.

Separation occurs during the relevant income year (year of entitlement)

If an individual separates from their partner during the relevant income year (year of entitlement) and either they and/or their ex-partner are required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year, but the ex-partner has not lodged an income tax return by the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

), a partial income reconciliation will occur when the individual's own actual

ATI

becomes known.

In the partial reconciliation process, the period when the individual was 'single' (the single period) will be reconciled using the individual's actual ATI either provided by the

ATO

after the individual lodges their income tax return for the relevant year or as notified by the individual if they are not required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant year. The period when the individual was partnered to their ex-partner (the couple period) will be reconciled using the income estimates provided for the ex-partner during the relevant income year and the individual's actual ATI as above.

The FTB (Part A and/or Part B) supplement can be paid following partial reconciliation as the supplement is not affected by any under-estimation of the ex-partner's income.

Interim reconciliation for the period that the individual and their ex-partner were together (the couple period) will not occur until 1 July of the year after the lodgement year or when the ex-partner lodges a tax return for the relevant year, whichever is earlier. In other words, interim reconciliation for the 'couple period' will occur after the end of the lodgement year, if the ex-partner's tax return is not lodged by then. The income used in interim reconciliation is the individual's actual income and the ex-partners last known (most recent) estimate, indexed estimate or indexed actual income. This process may result in a top-up or nil adjustment for the 'couple period'.

For individuals who separate in the year of entitlement, a special rule prevents any income-based debt being raised for the 'couple period' (see FAAct Schedule 3 clause 3A).

Separation occurs during the lodgement year

If an individual separates from their partner during the lodgement year and their ex-partner is required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year, but has not lodged that income tax return by the end of the lodgement year, interim reconciliation will occur after the end of the lodgement year (from 1 July) as long as the individual's own actual ATI is known.

The income used in the interim reconciliation is the individual's actual ATI and the ex-partner's last known (most recent) estimate, indexed estimate or indexed actual income.

FTB supplements may be paid following the interim reconciliation for the entitlement year. The interim reconciliation process may result in a top-up, an overpayment or nil adjustment. Unlike situations where separation occurs in the year of entitlement, an overpayment debt is possible because clause 3A does not apply to separations outside the relevant income year.

A final reconciliation using the ex-partner's actual income will occur when the ex-partner eventually lodges their tax return for the relevant income year.

Separation occurs after the lodgement year

Generally, non-lodger debts arise if income tax returns for the individual and/or their partner are not lodged by the end of the lodgement year. If income tax returns for the individual and/or their partner are not lodged by the end of the lodgement year, neither the supplement nor any income top-up can be paid.

If separation occurs after the lodgement year, any non-lodger debt raised against the individual will be written off if it is only the ex-partner's income tax return that has not been lodged. This will result in the suspension of any non-lodger debt recovery, from the date of separation.

Interim reconciliation is not appropriate because neither the supplement nor a top-up can be paid after the lodgement year. If the ex-partner lodges an income tax return for the relevant income year, the non-lodger debt is set aside (rather than simply being written off).

Reconciliation then occurs using the individual's and their ex-partner's actual ATI for the relevant year. This may only result in a debt or a nil adjustment. No top-up or supplement can be paid.

Note:

If an individual's ATI (which includes the ATI of their partner, if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

ACCS

There are no bereavement provisions for CCS or ACCS for the death of an eligible child.

Definition: claim in substitution - FTB

For the purpose of FTB, a claim can be made by an individual (

1.1.I.90

), in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for FTB regardless of whether the deceased person made a claim for FTB.

The circumstances of the deceased person are used to assess eligibility for FTB, not the circumstances of the applicant.

Explanation:

The deceased person may not have claimed FTB if they were intending to lodge a past period claim (

6.6.1 Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to underestimation of income

Summary

Individuals (and/or their partners, if applicable) cannot access

FTB

based on an estimate for a current entitlement year if they have had 2 consecutive years of zero entitlement to FTB due to underestimation of income.

Underestimation of income can only be established once actual

ATI

is known for a relevant income year, after tax returns have been lodged. Non-entitlement may apply to FTB Part A only, FTB Part B only (where income underestimated by the primary income earner) or both FTB Part A and Part B.

This process is designed to identify and prevent individuals accessing instalment payments and other FTB Part A-related government benefits if they have a pattern of non-entitlement due to underestimation of their income, but have been accessing these payments and/or ancillary benefits. The pattern is established if the individual has 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement due to underestimation of income.

Exceptions may apply in particular circumstances to prevent an individual becoming non-entitled when they otherwise would be.

The earliest financial year that can be counted for the purposes of non-entitlement is 2009-10.

Non-entitlement to FTB Part A or FTB Part B or both

The payment affected is the payment for which the underestimation of income specifically relates. If an individual is not entitled to FTB Part A due to underestimation of income, but they have entitlement to FTB Part B, they will only be precluded from receiving FTB Part A. If the individual is deemed to have no entitlement to FTB Part A and Part B they will be cancelled and will need to reclaim either or both payments at a later time when they can establish entitlement with their actual ATI or they can show they are eligible for an exception.

FTB Part B would only be affected if the inaccurate income estimate for instalment payment was for primary earner income. Underestimation of a secondary earner's income cannot preclude the individual/family from receiving FTB Part B.

If an individual is precluded from receiving one part of their FTB entitlement, but is still eligible for the other, the individual will be reconciled for both payments when their actual ATI is known. The individual will not have to reclaim for that payment.

Example:

Coby has his FTB Part A entitlement reconciled as nil due to underestimation of income for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 years, however he is still entitled to FTB Part B. As such, he will be unable to access payment of FTB Part A based on an estimate from 1 July 2012, but may still access FTB Part B. When his (and his partner, if applicable) actual ATI is known, reconciliation will occur for both FTB Part B and FTB Part A to confirm if he has any entitlement.

The FTB payment is cancelled when an individual has 2 consecutive years of non-entitlement to both FTB Part A and FTB Part B due to underestimation of income.

Example:

Josie has had her FTB entitlement to both FTB Part A and FTB Part B reconciled as nil due to underestimation of income for the 2009-10 and 2010-11 years. As such, her FTB will be cancelled and she will be unable to access fortnightly instalments from 1 July 2012.

Individuals who have their FTB cancelled due to underestimation of income can only access FTB by claiming a lump sum for the past income year when their actual ATI is known, or establishing they are eligible for an exception.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

6.6.3

Non-entitlement to FTB based on an estimate due to underestimation of income - exceptions

Effect of preclusion on partners

Where an individual is not entitled to a component/s of FTB based on an estimate due to underestimation of income, their current partner will also not be entitled to the same component/s. Therefore, the partner of a non-entitled individual is unable to access the FTB Part A and/or Part B components which the non-entitled individual is unable to access based on an estimate while they are partnered with the non-entitled individual.

This rule also applies to individuals who are currently not entitled to FTB. If such an individual partners with another person who is entitled to FTB, the non-entitlement will apply to both of them, following the individual becoming a member of a couple.

Conversely, where the individual re-establishes entitlement, and as a result their preclusion ends, this effect will carry over to their partner.

Similarly, in the instance where the partner (of a precluded individual) successfully makes a new claim, the preclusion that prevents the individual from receiving FTB payments is lifted.

Example:

Thomas is precluded from receiving FTB Part A payments due to zero entitlement for income years 2009-10 and 2010-11. Thomas' partner successfully made a lump sum claim for income year 2012-13. The preclusion is lifted as a result of the partner making a successful lump sum claim and the preclusion will also be lifted from Thomas. This means that either Thomas or his partner can access FTB Part A via instalments.

New partners

If the non-entitled individual becomes a member of a new couple, the new partner is also not able to access the same components of FTB based on an estimate which the non-entitled individual is unable to access, unless an exception applies.

Blended families

If an individual in a blended family is subject to non-entitlement due to underestimation of income, their current partner will also be non-entitled to the affected FTB payment based on an estimate for any FTB child, including FTB children from a previous relationship for whom the partner would otherwise have separately received FTB.

6.7 SIFS review & payment process

Summary

SIFS

was closed to new recipients from 1 July 2017. Grandfathering arrangements permit eligible recipients with entitlement to SIFS at 30 June 2017 to continue to receive SIFS as long as they remain eligible for the payment. See

2.11.1

.

This chapter covers the SIFS review and appeals process, and explains how SIFS payment determinations are made through the

FTB

reconciliation process and stand alone claims.

SIFS review & appeals process

SIFS decisions can be reviewed via a similar process to FTB reviews and appeals. Internal SIFS reviews can be conducted where Centrelink is satisfied there is sufficient reason to review a decision, or where an individual who is affected by a SIFS decision requests a review of that decision.

Centrelink initiated review

Where Centrelink initiates a review of a SIFS decision, the decision maker may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision. Once a review decision has been made regarding SIFS, there is no limit to the date of effect. This means that if the review decision generates SIFS arrears, these amounts will be payable to the individual regardless of how much time has passed since the original decision under review was made. Similarly, if the review decision results in a SIFS debt, this can be raised and recovered. This differs to how FTB reviews operate, as in most cases, full FTB arrears can only be paid if the review decision is made before the end of the income year following the income year that contains the first day of the period to which the original decision relates.

Note:

Where SIFS eligibility is tied to FTB and an FTB decision is reviewed with the result being that the individual is no longer entitled to FTB, this may affect their entitlement to SIFS both retrospectively and prospectively depending on the circumstances.

Centrelink cannot initiate a review of a decision that is already the subject of a review initiated by an affected person, but can initiate a review even if an application has been made to the

ART

for review in relation to the decision.

Review initiated by an affected person

Generally, an individual affected by a decision made by an officer under

FA

law can request a review. The decision will be quality checked by a subject matter expert (SME) and if the individual is not satisfied with the outcome they can request a review by an

ARO.

In most cases where an individual disagrees with a SIFS decision, they need to apply for a review within 52 weeks of being notified of that decision. The exceptions to this rule are:

Where Centrelink is satisfied there are special circumstances that prevented the individual from making a review application on time.

Where the individual has applied for a review because the

ATO

has made an assessment of their income and they lodged their income tax return before the end of the income year following the income year to which the assessment relates (or a further period).

Where the individual has applied for a review because the ATO has re assessed their income and they initially lodged their income tax return before the end of the income year following the income year to which the assessment relates (or a further period).

Note:

The reference to a further period in the above exceptions applies where Centrelink has granted the individual an extension to lodge their tax return because special circumstances prevented them from lodging on time. The further period granted by Centrelink cannot end any later than the end of the second income year after the income year to which the assessment relates.

Where an application for review is permitted, the ARO may affirm, vary or set aside the original decision. Once the ARO makes a review decision regarding SIFS, there is no limit to the date of effect. This means that if the review decision generates SIFS arrears, these amounts will be payable to the individual regardless of how much time has passed since the original decision under review was made. Similarly, if the review decision results in a SIFS debt, this can be raised and recovered.

External reviews

The external review process for SIFS is similar to that for FTB decisions. However, while there is no time limit associated with applying for a first review by the ART relating to FTB by instalments, a 90 day time limit applies for an individual to seek a first review in relation to a SIFS decision. This time limit may be extended where the ART concludes that an individual was prevented from making an application for an ART first review within the allowable time due to special circumstances. There is also no limiting date of effect for ART first decisions relating to SIFS. ART second reviews of decisions relating to SIFS operate in the same manner as those for decisions relating to FTB. For more information see

6.3

.

SIFS payment determination - interaction with FTB reconciliation process

Where an individual is eligible for FTB instalments, a SIFS payment determination is automatically performed at FTB reconciliation if the individual is a grandfathered recipient of SIFS.

In circumstances where an individual who is eligible for FTB and SIFS has more than one partner during the relevant income year, payment of SIFS is dependent on each individual lodging their tax returns or notifying they are not required to lodge. This means SIFS may be paid at a later date when actual taxable income is known for the ex-partner/s.

Payment determination - stand alone SIFS claim determination

Where an individual is not an FTB instalment recipient, but has a SIFS qualifying child (

2.11.2

), SIFS payment is dependent on receipt of an appropriate claim form (

4.14

) and all applicable tax returns being lodged or actual taxable income being provided to Centrelink.

1.1.P.17 Parental responsibility

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

and the SSAct, and

Family Law Act 1975

section 61B, parental responsibility means all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that parents have, by law, in relation to their children.

According to the Family Law Act section 61C, both parents of a child aged less than 18 years, have parental responsibility (subject to court orders) for their child. This responsibility continues, despite any changes in the nature of the parental relationship of a child (that is parental responsibility will not change if a child's parents become separated, or if one or both parents remarry).

A parenting order in relation to a child does not take away or diminish any aspect of the parental responsibility of any person for the child except to the extent (if any) expressly provided for in the order; or necessary to give effect to the order.

6.4.3.20 Non-lodger process

Summary

This topic outlines how Centrelink will follow up on individuals and/or their partners, who are required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

). It discusses:

the non-lodger process

prohibition on being paid

FTB

based on an estimate

the criteria for determining a non-lodger process, and

the treatment of individuals not selected for the non-lodger process.

Non-lodger process

The non-lodger process prompts individuals who receive FTB and/or their partners who are required to lodge an income tax return do so before the end of the relevant lodgement year.

In March/April of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

), if an FTB recipient and/or their partner have not lodged an income tax return for the relevant income year, or notified Centrelink of their

ATI

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, Centrelink will send them a non-lodger reminder letter. The letter advises that:

if they and/or their partner are required to lodge an income tax return, they must do so by 30 June of the lodgement year

if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, they must notify Centrelink of their ATI by 30 June of the lodgement year

the entire amount of FTB, FTB advance and

SBP

(where paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test) paid to them for the relevant income year may be raised as a debt to the Commonwealth if they and/or their partner are required to lodge an income tax return, or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, and they fail to do this by 30 June of the lodgement year, and

no top-ups of FTB (including supplements) can be made if they lodge their income tax returns, or notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, after 30 June of the lodgement year regardless of their family's ATI for that year.

Individuals may be reminded by Centrelink again before the end of the lodgement year to either lodge their income tax return or contact Centrelink to notify of their ATI if they are not required to lodge.

If an individual who receives FTB and/or their partner fail to lodge an income tax return by the end of the lodgement year or fail to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, a debt will be raised against them. The debt may comprise all the FTB they received for the relevant income year. Any SBP paid (where paid under the FTB Part A eligibility test) will also be raised as a debt.

Other

FA

payments such as SBP (where paid under the SBP income test) are not raised as a debt as there is no requirement to lodge an income tax return to receive these payments.

Note:

A non-lodger decision is a variation of the existing instalment entitlement determination made by the Secretary so that the individual is/was not entitled to FTB for the financial year for which they and/or their partner have not lodged a tax return.

Note:

Where

NBS

and/or

NBU

are included in a non-lodger debt or an SBP debt is raised due to an FTB non-lodger decision, the individual's entitlement to NBS, NBU and/or SBP for that child is not reassessed until the non-lodger status is resolved.

Individuals who receive FTB (and their partners, if any) may not be able to receive FTB based on an estimate if they have outstanding non-lodger debts as a result of non-lodger decisions for FTB received in relation to previous income years because they have not lodged their requisite income tax returns or failed to notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return for those income years.

While there is no explicit requirement under FA law for individuals to lodge a tax return, this requirement is imposed under tax law for certain individuals who are covered by 2 annual legislative instruments created by the Commissioner of Taxation each financial year. These instruments are:

Notice of Requirement to Lodge a Return for the Income Year Ended 30 June (relevant year), and

Notice of Requirement for Parents with a Child Support Assessment to Lodge a Return for the Income Year Ended 30 June (relevant year).

2.2.1.10 NARWP for FTB Part A

Summary

Migrants do not have immediate access to

FTB

Part A when they permanently settle in Australia (

1.1.A.120

).

Migrants who were granted a permanent visa or a temporary partner visa on or after 1 January 2019 are required to serve a

NARWP

of 52 weeks before they can receive FTB Part A. A NARWP also applies to claimants of certain social security payments,

PLP

and farm household allowance.

Note:

There is no NARWP for FTB Part B. Eligible visa holders will continue to have immediate access to FTB Part B, as long as they meet all other eligibility criteria.

There are a range of exemptions from the NARWP for FTB Part A. These are detailed in this topic.

For more information on the NARWP for other payments refer to SS Guide

Policy reference:

2.2.1

FTB eligibility criteria for individuals

Application of the NARWP

A person is subject to a NARWP for FTB Part A if on or after 1 January 2019 they:

become the holder of a visa determined by the Minister for the purposes of subparagraph 729(2)(f)(v) of the SSAct, or

become the holder of a permanent visa (with some exceptions - see below)

are the holder of a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403) and are either a worker in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme who has been approved to bring family members to Australia or the family member of such a worker.

The NARWP for FTB Part A does not apply to a person who:

becomes the holder of a specified Orphan Relative (subclass 117 and 837) or Remaining Relative (subclass 115 and 835) visa (or a kind of visa determined by the Minister), or

was the holder of a temporary Partner (Provisional) or Partner visa (subclass 309 and 820) at any time before 1 January 2019 before being granted a permanent visa.

A person's Part A rate of FTB is nil in respect of a day on which the NARWP applies. This means that a person is not able to receive FTB Part A in respect of a child until they have completed the NARWP. If a person is part-way through the NARWP and has a child in Australia, the remaining NARWP must be served before the person can be paid FTB Part A.

If one parent is an Australian citizen, is a migrant who has completed the NARWP, or has an exemption from the NARWP, that parent can receive FTB Part A (subject to meeting all other requirements), even if the other parent is still serving the NARWP.

For information on the visa subclasses specified under SSAct subsection 729(2)(f)(v) refer to SS Guide

3.7.1.10

Note:

The NARWP does not apply to FTB Part B,

Exemptions from the NARWP

A person is exempt from the effect of the NARWP for FTB Part A in respect of a day if they meet one of the following criteria - this means that they can still receive FTB Part A, despite a NARWP applying:

the person holds or was a former holder of a visa of a subclass included in a determination made by the Minister under SSAct subsection 739A(6) on that day

the person is the holder of a Pacific Engagement visa (subclass 192)

the person is receiving a social security pension or social security benefit (within the meaning of the SSAct) (see Example 1 and 2), or farm household allowance (under the

Farm Household Support Act 2014

) on that day

PLP (under the PPLAct) is payable to the person on that day

if the person is receiving PLP on at least 10 consecutive weekdays for a period, on any day in that period (including weekends)

the person is a refugee, or a former refugee (within the meaning of SSAct subsection 7(6B)), on the 'assessment day' (defined below) (see Example 3)

the following apply:

the person was a family member of another person at the time the other person became a refugee before the assessment day, or

the person is a family member of that other person on the assessment day or, if that other person has died, the person was a family member of that other person immediately before that other person died

the person is an Australian citizen on the assessment day, or

the person is residing in Australia on the assessment day and has held an

SCV

on any day before the assessment day.

The assessment day has flexible application, and can apply to any day on which entitlement to FTB Part A is being established. This means that a person would be able to receive FTB Part A at a rate greater than nil on any day on which an exemption applies but would be on a nil rate of FTB Part A for any days where an exemption does not apply. Similarly, for a past period claim, the claimant would be exempt from the NARWP for any day in that past period on which they met one of the above conditions but would not be exempt for (and could not make a claim in respect of) any days on which an exemption did not apply (see Example 3 and 4).

Note:

A person who is exempt from the NARWP must still meet other eligibility and payability criteria in order to receive FTB Part A. There is no NARWP for FTB Part B.

Example 1:

Abdul, Shireen and their child, Mina, are granted permanent visas under the Skilled stream in January 2019 and are subject to a 52 week NARWP for FTB Part A. As Shireen is not working, Shireen claims and is granted FTB Part B which is not subject to a NARWP. Six months later, Abdul and Shireen separate and Shireen retains full-time care of Mina who is 4 years old. Shireen claims

PPS

as they are the principal carer of Mina. Shireen is granted an exemption from the NARWP for PPS because they became a lone parent after becoming an Australian resident. As PPS is a social security pension within the meaning of the SSAct, Shireen is exempt from the effect of the NARWP for FTB Part A for any day on which they are receiving PPS. This means Shireen can receive FTB Part A for the remainder of the NARWP, provided they are still receiving PPS.

Example 2:

Jessica is a single parent from the UK and is granted a permanent skilled visa in January 2019 along with their 10 year old child, Ruben. Jessica claims and is granted FTB Part B once Jessica arrives as FTB Part B is not subject to a NARWP, however, Jessica is subject to the 52 week NARWP for FTB Part A. After they have been in Australia for 6 months, Ruben is diagnosed with leukaemia and Jessica has to stop work to take care of Ruben while they are undergoing treatment. Jessica depletes all their savings and finds themselves in financial hardship. Jessica is unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for themselves and Ruben or to cover Ruben's medical costs. Jessica claims

SpB

and is granted an exemption from the NARWP for SpB as their dependent child has developed a serious medical condition since their arrival in Australia and this constitutes a substantial change in circumstances. As SpB is a social security benefit within the meaning of the SS Act, Jessica is exempt from the effect of the NARWP for FTB Part A. Jessica will continue to be eligible for the exemption for FTB Part A for so long as they are receiving SpB.

Example 3:

Tamir was granted refugee status and arrived in Australia on 6 November 2019. On 17 July 2020, Tamir lodges a lump sum claim for FTB for the 2019-20 income year. Tamir has had refugee status since their date of arrival on 6 November 2019. As such, Tamir is exempt from the effect of the NARWP for FTB Part A from this date. Tamir's lump sum FTB claim is paid for the period 6 November 2019 to 30 June 2020.

Example 4:

Marcus arrived in Australia on 28 April 2019 on a permanent skilled visa with their 8 year old child Maria. On 4 January 2020, Marcus became injured and was unable to work. Marcus soon depleted their savings and was granted SpB on 27 February 2020 as they had experienced a substantial change in circumstances. Marcus subsequently started to recover from their injury and started a part time job on 1 April 2020. As Marcus' income exceeded the limit, they were no longer eligible for SpB. Marcus lodged a lump sum claim for FTB in August 2020. Marcus was exempt from the effect of the NARWP for FTB Part A while they were receiving a social security benefit (SpB), however, once Marcus stopped receiving SpB, they were no longer exempt from the NARWP for FTB Part A. Marcus' lump sum FTB Part A claim can be paid only for the period during which they were exempt from the NARWP for FTB Part A from 27 February 2020 to 1 April 2020.

Low income health care card (LIC) - FTB child exemption

Under the SSAct, a LIC is available on application to people with income below certain thresholds. While the LIC is subject to a NARWP, from 1 January 2019, people who have an FTB eligible child are exempt from the NARWP for the LIC.

Example 5:

Eleni is the primary carer of George, who is 4 years old. As George meets the criteria to be an FTB child, Eleni is exempt from the NARWP for the LIC. Eleni is able to claim the LIC provided Eleni meets all other eligibility criteria including the income test.

Application provisions/transitional arrangements

The NARWP for FTB Part A applies to people granted a permanent visa, or a relevant temporary visa, on or after 1 January 2019. People who were granted a permanent visa or relevant temporary visa (under SSAct section 729(2)(f)(v)) before 1 January 2019 are not required to serve a NARWP for FTB Part A. This applies even if they are granted a visa before 1 January 2019 but do not arrive in Australia until after 1 January 2019.

Holders of certain temporary visas continue to be exempt from the NARWP for FTB Part A, even if they are subsequently granted a permanent visa on or after 1 January 2019. Any break in payment will not affect this exemption.

This includes people who are:

former holders of an SCV, or

former holders of a visa of a subclass included in a determination made by the Minister under SSAct subsection 739A(6).

Duration of NARWP

The NARWP for FTB Part A is usually 52 weeks in duration. The length of a NARWP, how it is calculated and who it applies to depends on the date of a person's arrival in Australia and the benefit they apply for. Only time that a visa holder is physically present in Australia will count towards the NARWP.

Example 6:

Alison, who resides in Australia, was granted a permanent visa on 10 August 2019. Alison visited England to visit their parents for 4 weeks in December 2019. The time Alison is not physically in Australia will not be counted towards their 52 week NARWP for FTB Part A. Alison will have to wait an additional 4 weeks (28 days) before they will have served their NARWP.

See Example 7.

3

their NARWP begins on the date they first became the holder of a subclass 403 visa in the PALM stream or the PLS stream and ends when the person has been in Australia for a period of, or periods totalling, 52 weeks after that day.

See Example 8.

4

previously held a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403) in the Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS) stream or the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) stream and was either a worker in the PALM scheme approved to bring family members to Australia or was the family member of such a worker

their NARWP begins on the day that initial visa was granted, and ends when the person has been in Australia for a period of, or periods totalling, 52 weeks after that day. They are not required to re-start the NARWP once they become the holder of their current visa.

See Example 9.

5

is subject to the NARWP in any other circumstance (and neither of the above points apply)

their NARWP begins on the later of the date the person arrived in Australia or the date their permanent visa was granted and ends when the person has been in Australia for a period of, or periods totalling, 52 weeks after that day.

See Example 10.

Note:

The specified visas in items 1 and 2 of the above table are temporary partner visas, subclasses 309 and 820. From 1 January 2019, people who are granted one of these temporary partner visas are subject to a 52 week NARWP for FTB Part A, however, the period on the temporary visa contributes to serving the NARWP if they are subsequently granted a permanent visa. People granted a temporary partner visa before 1 January 2019 are not subject to a NARWP for FTB Part A while they hold the temporary partner visa or if they are subsequently granted the permanent visa. There is no waiting period for FTB Part B.

Example 7:

On 6 March 2019, Andrew applies for temporary and permanent Partner visas (subclasses 820 and 801). On 14 June 2020, Andrew is granted the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) so Andrew can continue to live with their partner Alice in Australia. Andrew will remain on the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) while Andrew's application for the permanent Partner visa (subclass 801) is processed. While on the temporary visa, Andrew is not residentially qualified for most welfare payments, except SpB and family payments (including FTB and PLP), however, Andrew must serve a NARWP before Andrew can access these payments, except for FTB Part B, which has no waiting period. The temporary Partner visa subclass 820 is a specified visa under paragraph 739A(3)(b) and 739A(4)(b) of the SSAct. This means the NARWP for SpB, FTB Part A and PLP begins from the date Andrew applied for the temporary Partner visa. The period Andrew spends in Australia following Andrew's application counts towards the NARWP for these payments, which will end on 6 March 2020 for FTB Part A, 6 March 2021 for PLP and 6 March 2023 for SpB, provided Andrew remains in Australia throughout this period. On 24 March 2022 Andrew is granted a permanent Partner visa (subclass 801). A 208 week NARWP will apply for most other welfare payments (for example,

JSP

) from the day Andrew is granted the permanent visa. However, for SpB and family payments, the time Andrew has spent on the temporary Partner visa (subclass 820) counts towards the NARWP for Andrew's permanent Partner visa. Therefore, on the date Andrew is granted their permanent visa, Andrew will have completed the NARWP for FTB Part A and PLP and have less than a year left to serve of the NARWP for SpB, and can access these payments if eligible during the NARWP for other payments.

Example 8:

Jill was granted a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403) on 5 February 2023 after being accepted as a participant in the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme. They entered into Australia on 3 March 2023 to begin their employment. In June 2024, Jill is approved for family accompaniment and intends to bring their partner Chris and their child over to live in Australia. As Jill’s visa was granted offshore, the NARWP started once they arrived in Australia. Jill must wait, from 3 March 2023, 52 weeks before they are residentially qualified for FTB Part A. Jill has been in Australia continually since they first arrived so they will have fully served the NARWP by the time their partner and child arrive.

Example 9:

Cecil is granted a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403) on 22 February 2023 after being accepted into the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme. Cecil has been approved for family accompaniment and wishes to bring their partner Rosa and their 2 children over to Australia. Cecil was previously working in Australia on a Temporary Work (International Relations) visa (subclass 403) as a part of the Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS) stream from 10 January 2018 to 16 March 2019. As Cecil has previously held a subclass 403 visa under a valid stream, their NARWP for FTB Part A begins from the day they first held that original subclass 403 visa under the PLS stream and ends when they have been in Australia for a period of, or periods totalling, 52 weeks. As a result, Cecil will have fully served the NARWP for FTB Part A, making them eligible to claim once their family arrive in Australia.

Example 10:

Andie lives in Canada and is granted a permanent Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme visa (subclass 187) on 24 July 2019 after being nominated by an Australian employer for a job in regional Australia. Andie moves to Australia on 2 November 2019. Andie is subject to the NARWP. As Andie's visa was granted offshore, the NARWP starts once they come to Australia. Andie must wait, from 2 November 2019, 52 weeks before they can receive FTB Part A, 104 weeks for PLP and 208 weeks for most other income support payments (unless Andie meets the qualification for an exemption to the NARWP).

1.4.3.10 Duty of care

What does duty of care mean?

Australian Government employees have a duty of care to the public when performing their duties. This extends to any advice given and/or any actions performed.

Breaches of duty of care

A breach of duty of care can result from negligent advice and/or a negligent action.

Payment of compensation as a result of negligence can only be considered if

DSS

, the Department of Education, Services Australia or the

ATO

have breached its duty to exercise reasonable care. The payment is made under

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013

(PGPA) section 23.

Decisions under

FA

law

The majority of decisions made under FA law are decisions that are subject to a right of review and these are determined by this legislative mechanism, rather than being settled under PGPA section 23. Therefore, if negligent advice is given and/or a negligent action occurs, it will rarely result in a common law duty of care and settlement under PGPA section 23.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

1.4.4

Liability of decision makers,

6.1

Centrelink review & appeal process

Contributory negligence

Contributory negligence occurs when the person affected by the negligence or a third party contributed to the negligence. In such a case, if Services Australia gave negligent advice and/or acted negligently, any compensation may be reduced to reflect the contributory actions of the person affected and/or the third party.

Loss because of taxation liability on arrears payments

Under the

Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1988

, measures were introduced to allow a 'lump sum payment in arrears' tax offset (formerly called a rebate) on arrears of income payable to a person for previous financial years. The tax offset applies retrospectively to payments made on or after 1 July 1986 and includes assessable pensions, benefits and allowances under the

SSAct

(

1.1.S.80

), the

Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986

, and

PLP

under the

PPLAct

.

The tax offset is designed to alleviate the problem of more tax being payable in the year in which the lump sum is received than would have been payable if the lump sum had been taxed in each of the years in which it had accrued.

If a person seeks compensation for a loss in these circumstances, they should first be referred to the ATO for clarification of their entitlement to this tax offset. It may be that after application of the tax offset, no economic loss may exist.

If the tax offset does not apply, or does not relieve the person of the additional taxation liability in full, the claim should be considered under PGPA section 23. If it can be accepted that the taxation liability in question arose from Services Australia negligence, then the claim may be settled under that direction. If no negligence occurred, the matter may still be considered under the

CDDA

.

4.4.2.20 Change in income related circumstances

Introduction

This topic covers income related changes in circumstances and the dates of effect of the resulting variations to the

FTB

rate. Changes in income related circumstances may result in an increase or decrease of FTB rates, including a decrease to nil.

Income related changes include:

changes to estimates of

ATI

changes to maintenance income.

Income changes causing a revised estimate of ATI

Income related changes in circumstances that may lead to a revised estimate of ATI include commencing or ceasing work, changes to hours of work, pay rises and superannuation payouts.

Date of effect - revised estimates of ATI

The dates of effect to be applied where a revised estimate changes the rate of FTB are shown in the following table.

If an income related change of circumstances resulting in …

is notified …

the date of effect of the reassessment is …

a favourable determination

for the current financial year

the date of notification of the change of circumstances.

Example:

Sue stops work and provides a revised estimate on 3 October. The date of effect of the increase is 3 October.

for a future financial year

the beginning of the financial year of the estimate.

Example:

Melissa provides an estimate for the new financial year on 15 June as they know that their hours of work will reduce from 1 August. The date of effect of the increase is 1 July.

an unfavourable determination (including a decrease to nil)

for the current financial year and is actioned in time for the payday following notification

the date of notification of the change of circumstances.

Example:

Martha commences work on 3 October and provides a revised estimate on 10 October. The change is actioned immediately taking their new estimate into account. Martha's FTB is reduced from the next payday with date of effect of 10 October.

for the current financial year and is not actioned in time for the payday following notification but a later payday

the beginning of the instalment period of the later payday.

Example:

Sue advises that their hours of work have increased and provides a revised estimate but the new estimate is not actioned in time for the next payday, the date of effect is the beginning of the next instalment period.

for a future financial year

the beginning of the financial year of the estimate.

Example:

Jennifer provides an estimate for the new financial year on 2 June as they know that their partner will receive a pay increase from 14 July. Jennifer's FTB is reduced with date of effect of 1 July.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.2.8.30

Revised estimates,

5.2.2

Information required for instalment claims

Change in income not notified or not notified within time

Where an individual provides a revised estimate some time after the increase in income has occurred (but within the same financial year) the date of effect rules, as outlined in the previous table, still apply. Debts of this nature can only be raised, by comparing actual income with estimated income within the reconciliation process.

Example:

Sue starts work on 30 August but does not provide a revised estimate until 10 May of the following year. Sue's FTB is reduced from the next payday with date of effect of 10 May.

Income & non-income related change advised at the same time

Generally, the date of effect is the date an individual notifies Centrelink of an event or change in their circumstance. However, in some cases, the date of effect may be different from the date of notification. For example, an individual may notify of a new child in the family and a related revised estimate which may affect the individual's FTB entitlement. Where the revised estimates affects the individual's rate of FTB for a reason other than just a change in ATI, such as the birth or adoption of a child, the date of effect is the day of the event (for example, the birth or adoption of the child).

If the change in income estimate did not occur because of the birth or adoption of the child, then the date of effect for the revised estimate should be the date of notification, but the date of effect for the new child should be the date of the child's birth or adoption.

Where an individual has a second child and at the same time their partner's income increases as a result of a pay rise, the new estimate is not the result of the birth or adoption of the child. As the pay rise is the only cause of the increased income, the date of effect for the revised estimate is the date the individual notifies Centrelink and the date of effect for the additional child is the date of the birth or adoption.

Example:

On 1 October Diane informs Centrelink of the birth of their second child, born on 28 July. At the same time, Diane provides a new estimate of their income because of a change in salary on 5 September. As both income and non-income related circumstances are involved, different dates of effect apply to each. As the birth of the baby is a change in non-income related circumstances, the date of effect of the FTB rate change in respect of the child is the date of the child's birth, that is 28 July. Diane's change in salary is a change in income related circumstances that is not attributed to the birth of the child, meaning that the revised estimate in this instance would apply from the date of notification, that is 1 October.

The date of effect of non-income related changes is outlined in

4.4.2.10

.

Mandatory continuous adjustment

Individuals who receive FTB by instalment and advise of a change in their ATI estimate during the year may have their FTB rate automatically adjusted, if required, to reduce the risk of an overpayment at the end of the income year. This process is known as mandatory continuous adjustment (MCA).

The individual's daily rate of FTB is calculated on the basis of the new estimate for the remainder of the income year, but a deduction is made from their daily rate to take account of the notional overpayment of FTB, if there is a notional overpayment, based on the previous income estimate.

)

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) is greater than the income free area (

1.1.I.40

). If their income is more than the income free area, the rate of

FTB

is reduced accordingly.

Indexed income - actual or estimate (FTB)

Reduction after reaching the income free area

When a family's ATI is greater than the income free area and equal to or less than the higher income free area, their maximum rate of FTB Part A is reduced by 20% of the income excess. If a family's ATI is more than the higher income free area, a rate reduction of 30% of the income excess applies. Where the family's rate is calculated using Method 1 under Step 3 of the Method 2 income test, a rate reduction of 30% of the income excess above the higher income free area applies. This reduction applies to the maximum rate (

1.1.M.26

) and results in the individual's income tested rate.

Under Method 1, if the income reduction results in a rate that is lower than the base rate, the base rate should be paid.

Note:

3.1.6.50 Child support agreements (pre July 2008)

Note:

This topic only covers details about child support agreements made and registered before 1 July 2008. For details on child support agreements made on or after 1 July 2008, see

3.1.6.45

.

Changes to child support agreements

Previously, the

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

required Child Support to accept any formal agreement lodged with them. This was regardless of the amount and irrespective of whether the agreement met reasonable maintenance action.

Explanation:

Formal agreements were also known as a consent agreement or consent arrangement.

From 29 May 1995 until 30 June 2008, the

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

required that when an

FTB

Individual lodged a child support agreement, Child Support could not accept the agreement until the terms had been approved by Centrelink. Centrelink had to determine whether the agreement satisfied the requirements to take reasonable maintenance action. Agreements made on or after 1 July 2008 can only be approved by Child Support.

Act reference:

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.30

Taking reasonable maintenance action

Changing a child support agreement

Once accepted by the Child Support Registrar, a child support agreement is legally binding. It may be beneficial for the parties involved in the agreement to seek legal advice when making and formalising a child support agreement. An agreement can only be varied or revoked by:

both parties lodging another agreement or ending the current agreement

one party applying to the court to have the agreement varied or ended, or

the period specified in the agreement being reached.

Example:

Child support agreements may be lodged for a specified period such as:

one financial year, or

to cover the child/ren until they reach 18 years of age.

Terms of an agreement

Individuals entering into an agreement should be aware that Child Support does not issue a new formula assessment for any period that is covered by an agreement unless a new formula assessment amount is required by the terms of the agreement. Individuals are encouraged to include provision for annual reassessment in their agreement. The terms of different agreements may appear the same at the time of lodgement, but in the long term the annual agreement amounts may change.

Example:

For both of the following examples assume:

there is one child aged 12 years

the annual assessment amount at time of lodgement is $5,000, and

the period of the agreement is from the date of lodgement until the child reaches 18 years.

Example 1:

An agreement is for an assessed annual liability rate of $5,000 per annum at the start of the agreement less a non-cash component of school fees of $1,000 at the time of the agreement. An annual assessment is calculated each financial year to assess the payer's (

1.1.P.72

) annual liability amount. The non-cash component of school fees is then deducted to assess the cash component of the agreement.

Example 2:

An agreement amount is fixed for $5,000 per annum. This amount is made up of:

$4,000 in cash, and

$1,000 is a non-cash component for school fees.

As this agreement is for a fixed amount of $5,000 per annum, Child Support is not required to reassess the payer's liability amount annually. Therefore, the agreement will remain at $5,000 and the Individual will only be required to collect $5,000 per annum until the child reaches the age of 18 years.

MAT

To meet the MAT, the amount of the agreement must be equal to or greater than the annual assessed rate as calculated by Child Support. However, an agreement may be considered 'reasonable' providing it is within $60 per annum of the assessed rate.

Agreements & assessments

Individuals receiving or claiming FTB at more than the base rate may lodge a child support agreement. They cannot have this agreement registered with Child Support unless they:

have an assessment, or

are replacing an existing agreement.

If an assessment is not already in place the Individual should apply for an assessment at the same time as lodging the agreement. The new agreement must meet the maintenance action test.

Future changes in an agreement

Future changes in a child support agreement need to be considered when deciding on whether to accept the agreement. At any time during the life of an agreement, the agreement must meet the maintenance action test.

Example:

Kellie and Nathan have 2 children aged 16 and 14 years. The annual assessed amount of child support is $27,070. Kellie and Nathan enter into an agreement where for the period 1 August 2004 to 31 December 2004 Nathan will pay Kellie the current assessed rate of child support and half of the children's educational expenses which are $7,000 per annum. For the period 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2005 Nathan will pay for all the school expenses for both children and 50% of all their medical and dental costs, consisting in total of $20,500 per annum. Although the total value of the agreement for the first period is above the assessed rate of child support, the agreement does not meet the maintenance action test because the value of the agreement is less than the assessed rate for the second period.

Agreements that specify a period of backdating

An agreement does not meet the MAT where the agreement:

specifies a period of backdating which involves a decrease to the formula assessment that applied in that earlier period

the agreement were to replace the formula assessment that applied, and

the payee is entitled to receive more than the base rate of FTB at the time the agreement is made.

Discharging arrears in an agreement

An agreement does not meet the maintenance action test where an agreement specifies that arrears are to be discharged. These agreements should be treated the same way as agreements that specify a period of backdating. However, where the amount of the agreement is higher than the annual assessed rate and has the effect of collecting the arrears in a reasonable period of time, then the agreement can be accepted.

Example:

Kym and Tom lodge an agreement for $3,900 per annum. Their current assessed rate of child support is $2,400. A clause to their agreement states: 'Upon implementation of this agreement we agree to discharge the outstanding maintenance of $3,500 by a cash payment of $2,000 and to discharge the remaining amount of $1,500'. This agreement can be accepted because Kym is effectively collecting the amount of $1,500 to be discharged in a reasonable period of time.

Differences between a child support agreement & other arrangements

A child support agreement differs significantly from arrangements made between a payee (

1.1.P.71

) and a payer to collect child support payments privately. The latter arrangement is informal and not binding on either party. The payee may change this arrangement at any time by requesting Child Support to commence collection of child support payments. However, a registered child support agreement has the same effect as a consent order made by a court, including the periodic and non-periodic provisions of an agreement.

Registered child support agreement

After a child support agreement is accepted and registered by Child Support, it is binding on both parties. It can only be replaced or varied by another agreement or by one party applying to the court to have the agreement discharged, suspended, revived or varied. However, Child Support can only collect and enforce periodic payments. If the payer fails to comply with other terms of the agreement (such as paying school fees), the payee may register the agreement with a court and have the court enforce compliance.

Child support agreements can be complex in nature. Most parties to an agreement want to formalise agreed arrangements that set out payment of child support in a combination of ways. This may include payments made to a school for education expenses as well as cash payment or loan repayments. In other cases a payer may wish to make child support payments to a value greater than assessed by Child Support. In these circumstances, an agreement could be lodged to formally register a specified liability with Child Support. Agreed terms of payment considered to be child support payments under the maintenance income test are covered in another topic.

If an agreement contains a component specified as being for a child's disability, this amount must be in addition to the value of the agreement.

1.1.E.10 Effective claim (FTB)

Definition

For the purposes of

FTB

, a claim for FTB must be effective before it can be determined. A claim is only effective if:

it is made in a manner and form approved by the Secretary

all relevant documents and information have been provided by the applicant (

1.1.A.72

)

if the claim is an instalment claim (

1.1.I.100

) by either an individual (

1.1.I.90

) or an

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

), bank details for direct credit have been provided (unless an exemption has been granted), and

if the applicant is an individual, a

TFN

statement for themselves and their partner (if any) have been provided.

If the claim is not effective, it is taken not to have been made. This means that the claim cannot be determined, and therefore there is no determination decision to review. However, the decision that the claim is not effective can be reviewed. If the applicant still wants to test their eligibility, a new claim must be lodged.

6.4.5.20 Death of partner

Summary

This topic explains the reconciliation process when an individual's (

1.1.I.90

) partner (

1.1.P.30

) dies.

Executor lodges returns early

If the individual's partner dies during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) and the executor of the deceased partner's estate lodges the tax returns before the end of the income year, reconciliation does not occur until after the end of the income year when the individual has lodged their tax return.

Example:

Mrs Nbebi receives

FTB

and Mr Nbebi dies on 1 January. The executor lodges the returns in March and the estate is wound up by the end of April. Mrs Nbebi lodges her tax return in August of the first lodgement year and her entitlement is reconciled soon after.

Individual lodges before executor

If an individual whose partner has died lodges his or her return in the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) before the executor has lodged the returns for the deceased partner an interim reconciliation can take place. The executor of the estate is required to lodge the returns before 30 June of the lodgement year so the final reconciliation can occur.

Executor fails to lodge returns

For FTB, if the executor of the estate has not lodged the tax returns by 30 June of the lodgement year then no further reconciliation takes place and any interim reconciliation outcome becomes the final reconciliation outcome.

Income to be used when partner dies during an income year

Where the partner dies part way through the income year, assessment of the individual's family assistance entitlement is carried out by including:

both the individual's and partner/s'

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) (or taxable income for

SIFS

) for any period they were a member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

), and

the individual's ATI only (or taxable income only for SIFS) for any period after their partner died.

Act reference:

FAAct

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.2.1

Adjusted taxable income - general provisions

Deceased partner's ATI to be annualised

Where the partner dies part way through the income year, the actual ATI of the deceased person is annualised for reconciliation purposes to bring it into line with the assessment for all other FTB,

CCS

and

ACCS

individuals.

The formula for annualising is:

'Income of partner to date of death' means the ATI of the partner up to and including the day before they died. 'Number of days partner was alive during income year' means the number of days up to and including the day before they died.

Example:

Mr Nbebi's ATI up to the date of his death on 1 January is $25,000. His annualised ATI for reconciliation purposes is $25,000 × 365 ÷ 184 = $49,592.

Explanation:

Only income up to the day before the person died is included. Even if the deceased person has income on or after the date of death (for example, bank interest, dividends, rental income) it is not included in the deceased person's taxable income. Any income earned on or after the date of death is included in a trust tax return.

Note:

For the purpose of SIFS, a deceased partner's income is not annualised.

Impact of deceased partner's income on reconciliation outcome

The reconciliation outcome for the period before the partner died (that is, while individual and partner were a member of a couple) can only be a top-up or a nil adjustment. It cannot result in a debt (

1.1.D.60

) for the period that the individual was with their deceased partner. This is similar to the treatment of individuals who separate during the income year.

4.2.4.130 Claim action 13 - taxable income not assessed

Is a letter required?

Yes.

Content of the letter

Advise the individual (

1.1.A.72

) that their

FTB

entitlement for the past period claim cannot be determined until they and/or their partner have lodged their income tax return/s and Centrelink has received an assessment of their taxable income (

1.1.T.20

) for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

) from the

ATO.

Advise the individual that they and/or their partner must lodge all necessary income tax return/s before the end of the lodgement year (

1.1.L.30

) in order to receive any FTB payment.

Advise the individual that if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return for the relevant income year, they must notify Centrelink of their

ATI

before the end of the lodgement year in order to receive any FTB payment.

If either the individual and/or their partner do not lodge an income tax return, or they do not notify Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, the claim cannot be determined.

What to do

The claim can be processed but sits pending subject to the individual (and/or their partner) lodging their income tax return/s, if required to lodge, and an assessment of their taxable income/s for the relevant income year has been received from the ATO. If the individual and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return, the claim sits pending until the individual and/or their partner provide/s notification of their ATI for the relevant year.

If the individual and/or their partner do not lodge an income tax return, of if they do not notify Centrelink of their ATI if they and/or their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return by the end of the lodgement year, the claim is taken never to have been made.

Record-keeping

An electronic or paper file record of this advice should be kept.

FTB

objectives

FTB consists of 2 parts FTB Part A and FTB Part B.

FTB Part A is designed to help families with the cost of raising children. Payment of FTB Part A is based on the combined income of a family, and is paid in respect of each eligible FTB child (

2.1.1

).

FTB Part B provides extra help for single parent families and couple families (

1.1.M.50

) with one main income earner.

FTB eligibility

General provisions for eligibility apply to individuals (

1.1.I.90

). Eligibility of

ACO

Determining FTB rates

FTB Part A is paid at different rates depending on:

the individual and their partner's (

1.1.P.30

) combined

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

), and

the number and ages of eligible children in the family.

Families may also be eligible for

RA

if an FTB child or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) in the family is also an RA child.

Additional conditions apply to the payment of FTB Part A. Where a child does not meet the immunisation or health check requirements (

2.1.3

), the FTB child rate will be reduced for each day during an FTB rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

):

an individual must meet immunisation requirements for all children aged under 20 years (

2.1.3.10

), and

if an individual or their partner receives an income support payment on any day that the individual is also receiving FTB Part A, and they have an FTB child that turns 4 in that income year, an age-appropriate health check must be undertaken for that child (

2.1.3.50

).

To be eligible for FTB Part B the primary earner (

1.1.P.122

) must have an ATI at or below the income limit (

1.1.I.45

). FTB Part B is paid at different rates depending on the age of the youngest child and when the individual is a member of a couple, the income of the secondary earner (

1.1.S.25

).

An individual is not eligible for FTB Part B if they are a member of a couple and their youngest child is aged 13 years or over, unless the individual is the grandparent or great-grandparent (

1.1.G.15

).

FTB payment options

Individuals have a choice of different ways to receive FTB through Centrelink (

4.3.1.10

).

They may choose to receive FTB:

as a fortnightly payment (

4.3.2

), or

as a lump sum payment (

4.3.5

) at the end of the income year.

Individuals receiving FTB as fortnightly instalments may choose to receive ES as fortnightly or quarterly payments.

ACOs can only receive FTB and ES through Centrelink as a fortnightly payment or as a lump sum.

FTB end of year supplements

The FTB Part A and Part B supplements increase the individual's rate of FTB Part A and Part B but are only paid after the end of the income year once the reconciliation conditions are satisfied.

Additionally, if an individual's ATI (which includes the ATI of their partner, if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

Note:

The supplement may be used to offset any outstanding FTB,

CCS

or income support payment debts.

Supplementary benefits

Families receiving fortnightly instalments of FTB Part A (

) at a rate greater than nil and whose income is below the FTB Part A income free area (

3.1.1.20

) are automatically entitled to a

HCC

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.4.50

Health care card (HCC)

Background to

FA

payments

The FA (

1.1.F.02

) arrangements were implemented as part of changes to Australia's taxation system on 1 July 2000. FA payments are administered by Centrelink under FAAct and FA(Admin)Act.

FA payments are aimed specifically at families to:

increase assistance

improve work incentives, and

customise the delivery of assistance.

Twelve types of assistance that were previously available to families were replaced by 3 forms of assistance:

FTB Part A

FTB Part B, and

child care benefit.

FTB Part A replaced:

family allowance at the minimum and more than minimum rate

Family tax payment (FTP) Part A, and

Family tax assistance (FTA) Part A.

FTB Part B replaced:

basic

PP

guardian allowance

FTP Part B

FTA Part B

dependent spouse rebate (with children), and

sole parent rebate.

Payments under the government's new tax package came into effect on 1 July 2000. At that time provisions related to FA were repealed from Social Security Law. Transitional arrangements were put in place for individuals already receiving a family benefit (

1.1.F.05

) prior to 1 July 2000.

The 2004 Federal Budget provided additional assistance with the introduction of the FTB Part A supplement payable as part of the reconciliation process from 1 July 2004. In 2005, the FTB Part B supplement was introduced for part-year from January 2005, payable from 1 July 2005.

On 1 July 2004, the child care tax rebate (CCTR) was introduced for families and was administered by the

ATO

. For the 2006-07 income year, and subsequent years, CCTR was removed from the tax system to be delivered as an FA payment through Centrelink.

From 1 July 2009, CCTR was renamed child care rebate (CCR).

In early 2008, the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance (JETCCFA) was introduced.

In 2011, payment of the FTB Part A supplement for children turning 4 years during the relevant income year was made conditional on the child undergoing a health check.

In 2012, payment of the FTB Part A supplement for children turning 1, 2, and 5 years during the relevant income year was made conditional on the child meeting immunisation requirements.

On 1 July 2013, the clean energy supplement (CES) was introduced as a new component of FTB which was to help eligible households with any impact from the carbon price on everyday expenses.

On 1 March 2014, the baby bonus was abolished and the NBS was introduced as a new component of FTB Part A to help families with the upfront costs of a new child (where the family is not accessing a

PPL

payment for that child).

From 20 September 2014 the CES was renamed the ES and ceased to be indexed.

On 1 January 2016, immunisation requirements were extended to FTB children who turned one in the relevant income year and in each income year after that up to and including 19 years for the payment of the FTB Part A supplement and to children aged under 20 for child care assistance payments. Exemptions based on personal, philosophical and religious objections were also ended.

From 1 July 2016, FTB Part B was removed for couple families (other than grandparents and great-grandparents) with a youngest child aged 13 or over. Single parents, grandparents and great-grandparents caring for a youngest child aged 13 to 18 will continue to have access to FTB Part B (subject to satisfying other relevant requirements).

From 1 July 2016, if an individual's ATI (which includes the ATI of their partner, if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

From 20 March 2017, ES ceased for new FTB recipients. For individuals who became new recipients of FTB after 20 September 2016, they will no longer be paid ES after 19 March 2017. However, eligible individuals and ACOs may continue to be paid ES as part of their FTB rate under grandfathering rules. See

8.2

.

From 1 July 2018, where a child does not meet the immunisation or health check requirements, the FTB child rate will be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period.

On 2 July 2018, CCS and

ACCS

replaced child care benefit and CCR as part of the Government's new child care package. Amongst other things, one component of the ACCS, namely the ACCS (transition to work) replaced JETCCFA.

From 1 July 2019, newly arrived migrants are required to serve a

NARWP

of 52 weeks before they can receive FTB Part A. See

2.2.1.10

2.1.3.20 CCS immunisation requirements

Summary

A child meets the immunisation requirements (

1.1.I.10

) for

CCS

if they:

are immunised according to the standard vaccination schedule

are on an eligible catch-up vaccination schedule, according to the current

Australian Immunisation Handbook

, or

have an approved exemption from the requirements (

2.6.2.30

).

For CCS, the child's immunisation status is held by the

Australian Immunisation Register

.

6.4.2.30 FTB reconciliation due to maintenance income

Summary

This topic explains how maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

) can affect the reconciliation of

FTB

Part A. It details:

assessment of entitlement – Child Support collect

assessment of entitlement – private collect

maintenance income

child support agreements, and

annualisation of maintenance income.

Assessment of entitlement - Child Support collect

For individuals who use Child Support collect (

3.1.5.50

) and are entitled to more than the base rate of FTB Part A under the income test, and who have, or whose partner has, children from a previous relationship, reconciliation must also take into account the actual amount of maintenance income received during the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

).

This means that at reconciliation, a payee's FTB Part A entitlement is calculated on both their actual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) and the actual amount of maintenance income received. This is compared to the amount of FTB Part A they were paid based on estimate/s of both their ATI and maintenance income.

Example:

Deborah is single and receives FTB by instalments for their child for the income year. Deborah's FTB instalments are assessed on her estimated ATI of $60,000 and estimated maintenance income of $5,000. Deborah's actual ATI is $60,000 but they did not receive any maintenance income disbursements during the year according to Child Support. This results in a positive adjustment and Deborah receives a top-up as their FTB Part A was assessed by Centrelink under the entitlement method during the income year.

Assessment of entitlement - private collect

Individuals who use private collect (

3.1.5.55

) and are entitled to more than base rate of FTB Part A under the income test, and who have, or whose partner has, children from a previous relationship, will be deemed to have privately collected their full child support entitlement at reconciliation.

This means that at reconciliation, a payee's FTB Part A entitlement is calculated on both their actual ATI and the deemed amount of maintenance income.

Maintenance Income

Only maintenance income received or deemed to be received during a relevant period (

1.1.R.25

) can affect an individual's rate of FTB during a relevant income year.

Child support agreements

For FTB recipients who have a child support agreement, Centrelink will use the 'Child Support notional assessment' amount in determining their FTB Part A entitlements. The notional assessment is the annual rate of child support that would be payable under the child support formula if there was no child support agreement in place. For guidance on child support agreements in relation to which there is a notional assessment, refer to

3.1.7.14

.

Annualisation of maintenance income

When determining FTB Part A entitlement, it may be necessary to annualise the amount of maintenance income received during the relevant

period/s in an income year

. For individuals using private collect, this may involve the annualisation of the amount of maintenance income the individual is deemed to have received based on their daily child support rate and the number of days that rate applied.

Where an individual only receives maintenance income for part of the relevant income year, that income is annualised for reconciliation purposes to bring it into line with the assessment of all other FTB recipients.

The formula for annualising is:

Example:

George's relevant period during the relevant income year is 200 days. For the first 100 days, George's privately collected maintenance entitlement is $1,825.00 per annum ($5.00 per day). For the second 100 days, George's entitlement increases to $3,650.00 per annum ($10.00 per day). The total maintenance income deemed to be collected by George is $1,500.00 ($5.00 × 100 plus $10.00 × 100). The annualised maintenance income used to determine George's entitlement for the relevant period is $2,737.50 ($1,500.00 × (365 ÷ 200)).

6.4.1.30 Reconciliation process

Note:

Individuals and/or their partners have 12 months after the income year (

1.1.I.75

) to lodge an income tax return or notify Centrelink of their

ATI

if they are not required to lodge an income tax return in order to receive

FTB

supplements or top-ups.

Example:

Iain was paid FTB for the 2023-24 income year. Iain and his partner Catherine have until 30 June 2025 to lodge their tax returns or notify Centrelink of their ATI if Iain and/or Catherine are not required to lodge a tax return, to ensure they receive their full entitlement (including supplements and any top-up).

Note:

Lodgement of tax returns are the responsibility of the individual, including those who lodge via a tax agent. Providing financial statements to a tax agent or accountant prior to 30 June of the relevant lodgement year does not constitute lodgement of tax returns. Centrelink may grant an extension to the tax lodgement period if there are special circumstances that prevent an individual from meeting their income confirmation obligations before the end of the lodgement year. A tax lodgement deferral granted by the

ATO

does not automatically guarantee that Centrelink will grant a special circumstances extension. Special circumstances are circumstances that are unusual, uncommon or exceptional. Failure by an accountant or tax agent to lodge a tax return within the lodgement period (for example, forgetting to lodge in time or delay due to high workloads) will not ordinarily constitute special circumstances.

Explanation:

The ATO may grant a tax lodgement deferral after considering the individual’s circumstances in the context of tax law. However, this does not obligate Centrelink to grant an extension to the FA lodgement period as the objects of and considerations relevant to

FA

law differ from those applicable to tax law.

Summary

This topic outlines the steps involved in the reconciliation of FTB and

CCS

. It covers the:

assessment of FA entitlement

assessment of CCS entitlement

FTB Part A supplement

FTB Part B supplement

comparison of amount entitled to amount paid

notification of reconciliation outcomes

different timing of FTB and CCS reconciliation, and

using CCS to offset FA debts.

Assessment of FA entitlement

Excluding CCS, the first step of the reconciliation process is to determine the individual's annual entitlement for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

). This relies on the assessment of the individual's and their partner's (if applicable) actual ATI (for FTB), actual maintenance income (for FTB Part A only as relevant). This information will determine the individual's entitlement for the relevant income year.

Annual entitlement is also dependent on whether an individual is eligible for the end of year FTB Part A supplement for each of their children and/or the FTB Part B supplement.

Note:

If an individual (and their partner, if they are have one) are not required to lodge an income tax return, they must notify Centrelink of their ATI for the relevant income year. The notification can only be accepted if the ATI amount is considered to be reasonable.

Assessment of CCS entitlement

CCS reconciliation occurs for all individuals who had entitlement determined (including nil) for a week in a CCS fortnight that began in the relevant income year. The process begins once the reconciliation conditions have been met, that is, post the end of the financial year, the individual (and any partner during the relevant income year) have lodged and had tax returns assessed, or if there is no requirement to lodge, notified Centrelink of their actual ATI.

Using the actual ATI, each determination of entitlement is reviewed to determine a new entitlement amount, and the difference (if any) of any entitlements already received.

FTB Part A supplement

The FTB Part A supplement is paid to a person who is eligible to receive FTB Part A for an FTB child, but is only payable as part of the reconciliation process. The FTB Part A supplement cannot be paid in fortnightly instalments.

Payment of the supplement is conditional on:

the FTB individual and/or their partner lodging an income tax return or notifying Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months of the relevant income year, and

the FTB individual having family ATI of $80,000 or less for the relevant income year.

The FTB Part A supplement is included as part of the rate calculation process during reconciliation and may have the effect of reducing an overpayment incurred during the current or previous income

year/s.

FTB Part B supplement

The FTB Part B supplement is paid to a person who is eligible to receive FTB Part B but is only payable as part of the reconciliation process. The FTB Part B supplement cannot be paid in fortnightly instalments.

Payment of the supplement is conditional on the individual and/or their partner lodging an income tax return or notifying Centrelink of their ATI if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months of the income year. The FTB Part B supplement is included as part of the rate calculation process during reconciliation and therefore, may have the effect of reducing an overpayment incurred during the current or previous income

year/s.

Amount entitled versus amount paid

The second step in reconciliation is to subtract the amount paid to the individual in FTB instalments or CCS fee reductions during the relevant income year according to Centrelink records from the individual's FTB and/or CCS entitlement. The result of this calculation is the reconciliation outcome which may entitle an individual to a top-up, require the repayment of a debt, or a nil adjustment.

Example:

Marlene is single and receives FTB Part A for one child during the 2023-24 income year. The fortnightly entitlement is calculated based on Marlene's estimate of $75,000. Marlene lodges their tax return in August 2024 and their income is assessed by the

ATO

to be $78,000. Marlene's underestimated income for 2023-24 may give rise to an overpayment but this would be offset by the FTB Part A supplement to the value of the overpayment. If there is a supplement balance left over, it would be paid to Marlene.

Outcomes of reconciliation

Notification of reconciliation outcomes

For FTB, in cases where a Secretary-initiated review (that is, reconciliation) is carried out, only positive (top-ups) or negative (debts) adjustments of FTB need to be advised in writing to individuals. However, all individuals with a nil adjustment following reconciliation may be advised that they have been correctly paid.

For CCS, in cases where a Secretary-initiated review (that is, reconciliation) is carried out, the outcome needs to be advised in writing to individuals.

In cases where the reconciliation of FTB is triggered by the lodgement of an income tax return, the reconciliation outcome may be advised to the ATO. The ATO may use some or all of an FTB top-up payment for the recovery of any tax debts (after it has been used to recover FA debts). Conversely, once a tax refund has been applied to any tax debts, that may exist, the ATO may use any remaining tax refund to recover FTB, CCS or

ACCS

debts. If the ATO is unable to fully recover a debt from the individual's or partner's tax refund (where the partner consents to such recovery), the residual debt amount will be advised to Centrelink for recovery.

In all cases where an individual initiates a review of their entitlements, they must be notified in writing of the outcome.

Different timing of FTB & CCS reconciliation

Due to different information being required to reconcile FTB and CCS, reconciliation can occur at different times for each payment, depending on when this information is available.

Using CCS withholding to offset debts

Five per cent of CCS payments made during the financial year are withheld to assist with managing any potential debts. Should a debt be raised at reconciliation, the withheld amount of subsidy will first be used to offset that debt.

1.1.D.78 Determination (ACCS (child wellbeing))

Definition

An

ACCS

(child wellbeing) determination is a process by which Services Australia, on application by an approved provider (

1.1.A.90),

considers that a child is/was at risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect at the time the care is/was provided.

Typically, an approved provider can apply for a determination of up to 13 weeks at a time. However, they can apply for a determination of up to 52 weeks if they have evidence that the child is:

in formal foster care

in a formal kinship care arrangement

on a long term protection order.

A determination is made for full weeks and must start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. Every week the determination is in effect for, needs to include at least one day where a child meets the definition of 'at risk of serious abuse or neglect'. Generally, determinations can be backdated up to 28 days before the application was made. Backdating can only be longer than this in exceptional circumstances. In these cases, determinations can be backdated up to 13 weeks (

2.8.1.70

).

The approved provider must submit third-party evidence to demonstrate the child meets the definition of ‘at risk of serious abuse or neglect.

A determination is valid at any approved child care service of any approved provider and irrespective of the individual with whom the child resides (as long as that individual is

CCS

eligible).

Example:

Abbie’s parents have a shared care arrangement, and both parents have an active CCS claim. On Mondays and Tuesdays Abbie attends Little Lions Child Care on an enrolment under one parent’s details, and on Thursdays and Fridays she attends High Street Care on an enrolment under her other parent’s details. Little Lions Child Care submits an ACCS determination for Abbie, and once approved, it applies to her sessions at both Little Lions Child Care and High Street Care. Because there is an approved determination in place at Little Lions, High Street Care does not need to apply for any additional determinations for that same period.

If a child remains at risk after the determination ends, the approved provider may apply for further determinations for the child. The approved provider may need to provide additional evidence before a subsequent determination can be made. A provider will need to give another certificate for the child if 12 months (

1.1.T.51

) has passed since the original certificate commenced, before applying for further determinations.

1.1.P.40 Partnership

Definition

For the purposes of income and assets assessment, a partnership is the relationship that exists between people carrying on business in common, with a view to making a profit. A partnership agreement may be oral or written.

It is important to note that

FTB

is not assets tested.

The business may be run:

in the owners' name/s, or

under a registered business name.

The business is not a separate legal entity, which means that although the partnership lodges a tax return, the profit or income is assessable in the hands of the individual partners.

Each partner:

owns an agreed portion of the business assets

receives an agreed portion of the profits, and

is 'jointly and severally' liable for all business debts (that is, if one partner defaults, the other/s are liable for all the business debts).

3.5.2.40 CCS - other recognised participation types

Summary

If an individual (

1.1.I.90

) undertakes a recognised participation type that is not one of the prescribed recognised participation types for

CCS

, the delegate can determine that the participation be recognised for the purposes of the CCS, if it maintains or improves the individual's work skills or employment prospects (or both).

This topic includes:

consideration of other recognised participation types

evidence

change of circumstances

examples.

Consideration of other recognised participation types

A Centrelink delegate may determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether another participation type that is not one of the recognised participation types may also be recognised for the purposes of CCS.

When making a claim (

1.1.C.27

) for CCS, or when updating circumstances, the individual can provide details of the participation they undertake and request it be recognised for the purposes of CCS. The individual must provide a statement of how the participation will maintain or improve work skills or employment prospects (or both), and the number of hours they will be engaging in the participation type per fortnight.

The delegate will consider the information provided by the individual, including whether the participation could reasonably be expected to maintain or improve the individual's work skills, employment prospects (or both). If the delegate believes the participation likely meets the requirements to be recognised, the delegate will also:

contact the individual and request documentary evidence (see evidence below) to confirm the participation type should be recognised

determine whether to limit the number of hours per fortnight the participation type will be recognised

determine whether to limit the number of fortnights the participation will be recognised, based on the nature and circumstances of the participation.

Evidence

While the individual will not be asked to provide evidence of their participation at the time of submitting a claim for CCS or when updating their circumstances, if the delegate believes the participation likely meets the requirements to be recognised, they will contact the individual and request that this documentary evidence be provided. This can include documentation from a third party that shows the individual's participation. Acceptable evidence may include:

documents relating to the organisers of the participation including official letterheads of organisations

rosters/schedules

other documentation that demonstrates a link between the participation and the individual

a statutory declaration may also be accepted if no other form of documentation can be provided or if a third party is not involved.

Change of circumstances

If an individual's circumstances change, for example, they are no longer engaging in the recognised participation, they are obliged to notify Centrelink of the change. Once the individual has updated their circumstances, their subsidised hours result may change and their CCS entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) will be adjusted accordingly (previous entitlement decisions will be reviewed if the individual does not notify of the change in participation in a timely way).

Examples

Participation types that would NOT be recognised for the CCS (in addition to the prescribed recognised participation) include but are not limited to those that are:

for an unlawful purpose

Any participation that is for an unlawful purpose or for an employer, business or another person or organisation that has an unlawful purpose.

personal or family responsibilities

Providing food for one's own, the family's or friends' benefit, including grocery shopping, vegetable gardening, fruit or vegetable picking or food preparation.

Providing a residential dwelling for the family including house/flat hunting, or maintenance of an individual's property (including shared areas as part of a body corporate).

Unpaid work building/renovating a residential dwelling, including for the individual, the individual's family or for a friend or relative (this is distinguished from doing unpaid work in a family business owned by an immediate family member, which is recognised).

Providing recreational activities for an individual's children (including providing travel to/from the activity).

Unpaid participation relating to exercising, training or caring for family or friend's pets, including vet or grooming visits etc. (participation related to the care and exercise of animals may still be accepted through one of the other recognised participation types. For example, volunteering at an animal shelter that is a recognised charity may be considered unpaid voluntary work. If the individual has the intention of being a veterinarian or vet assistant, providing assistance with animals at a veterinary clinic could be considered unpaid work experience. Where the individual is engaged in unpaid work at a pet shop owned by their parents this could be recognised as unpaid work in a family business owned by an immediate family member. If the individual was self-employed in an industry related to the health and care of animals they should report their participation as hours of paid work).

Planning or attending occasions for family and friends including weddings, anniversaries etc.

Helping a friend or family member or neighbour (this is distinguished from unpaid work in a family business where the individual is considered to benefit from the success of the family business while not being directly renumerated, or unpaid voluntary work that improves the individual's work skills and employment prospects (or both), for charities and community organisations or in schools, preschools and centre based day care services).

sport and recreation

Unpaid participation in sporting events for an individual's leisure, interest or personal wellbeing - as either player or spectator - including for a work team.

personal pursuits.

Participation in hobbies, including related educational courses that may be undertaken.

Participating in social clubs.

Unpaid participation in the performing arts for interest or leisure.

Attendance at official events such as ANZAC Day, Australia Day etc. (unless as a volunteer at these events in which case the participation may be unpaid voluntary work).

Attending religious services, events or activities.

).

Centrelink must be satisfied that a proposed nominee understands the responsibilities they are taking on and appears capable of carrying them out.

Particular scrutiny should be given to requests where the nominee:

runs a boarding or rooming establishment, or

does not live in the same residence, or in close proximity to the individual.

Where a payment nominee is appointed following the issuing of a security notice in relation to the individual, the payment nominee must apply any amount paid to them in accordance with a written direction given by the Secretary.

A nominee is required to advise of any matter that affects their ability to act as a nominee. Any nominee arrangement must be reviewed as soon as any allegations of misuse of the payment are received.

1.1.C.15 Certificate (ACCS (child wellbeing))

Definition

An

ACCS

(child wellbeing) certificate is the process in which an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) certifies to the Secretary that they consider that a child is or was at risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect on a day (at risk day).

The certificate is given by the approved provider for a particular approved child care service, allowing that service to access ACCS (child wellbeing) for a maximum of 6 weeks, within each 12-month period. The certificate is valid for all enrolments (

1.1.E.25

) of the child at that service.

A certificate is given for full weeks and must start on a Monday and end on a Sunday. Every week the certificate is in effect for needs to include at least one day where a child meets the definition of ‘at risk of serious abuse or neglect’.

Certificates can generally be backdated up to 28 days, and up to 13 weeks in exceptional circumstances (

2.8.1.70

). The approved provider must ensure it meets the ‘giving notice’ (

1.1.G.13

) requirements.

In order to continue to receive ACCS (child wellbeing) once the service has accessed 6 weeks of certificate/s, the approved provider will need to apply to Services Australia for ACCS (child wellbeing) determinations (

1.1.D.78

) if the child continues to be ‘at risk’.

If the child is still attending the service and continues to be at risk after 12 months (

1.1.T.51

), the approved provider will need to give a new 6-week certificate, before continuing to apply for ACCS (child wellbeing) determinations as required.

4.4.5.30 Failure to notify change of address

Cancellation of entitlement

Where an instalment individual has changed address, and Centrelink does not know their new address, even though they have tried to obtain it, the individual's

FTB

entitlement may be cancelled. The date of effect of the cancellation is the day after the end of the individual's latest entitlement period.

Explanation:

In practice, FTB entitlement should always be cancelled where an individual fails to inform Centrelink of a change of address.

Reinstatement of entitlement

Where Centrelink then finds out that the individual's address has not changed or becomes aware of the person's new address before the end of the next income year, the cancellation must be varied. The variation reinstates the determination that applied before the cancellation.

7.6 FTB advance debts

Introduction

An

FTB

advance debt will generally only arise where the individual has lost ongoing legislative entitlement to FTB Part A (for example, FTB is transferred to the individual's partner, no children in care, the individual dies, income precludes entitlement etc.). However, advance debts also arise where:

it is established the individual was not entitled to the advance issued (or was entitled to a lesser advance amount)

at the discretion of the Secretary where the advance repayment period has become unreasonably lengthy due to a reduction in the individual's ongoing FTB Part A rate, or

a non-lodger determination is made for a period where an individual's FTB Part A rate was reduced to repay an advance.

Ongoing FTB Part A entitlement ceases

Where an individual receives an FTB advance and their ongoing FTB Part A entitlement ceases during the repayment period (

1.1.R.33

) or entitlement is reduced to nil due to non-compliance with immunisation or health check requirements (

2.1.3

), any unrepaid FTB advance becomes a debt.

The reduction amount to date is the sum of the daily reduction amounts applied since the repayment period for the advance commenced.

Example:

Justin received an FTB advance, but ceased to be entitled to FTB Part A during the repayment period, as his only FTB child left his care. The amount of the advance left unrepaid when he ceased to be entitled to FTB Part A then becomes an advance debt.

Note:

This does not apply to circumstances where the individual's FTB is currently at a zero rate due to reductions for a previous advance, FTB payment choices (

4.3.1.20

) or where the individual is subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate (

6.4.3.40

), as the individual's legislative entitlement is retained while subject to these provisions.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 71A(3) Debt arising during the repayment period for an FTB advance

No entitlement to FTB Part A/overpayment of FTB Part A on advance assessment day

Where a variation or a review varies the individual's FTB Part A entitlement relating to an advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

), the decision to grant the advance and the amount issued may be affected by the variation. In this situation, the advance issued is reassessed, and if the individual's correct advance amount is less than the actual advance amount issued, the new amount is taken to be the 'correct amount' (which could be nil). Any difference between the amount issued and the correct amount then becomes an FTB advance debt.

Note:

This provision only applies to circumstance changes affecting the FTB Part A rate on the advance assessment day, whether the Secretary becomes aware of these changes as a result of the reconciliation process or otherwise. Therefore this provision does not apply to variations to the individual's FTB Part A rate on the advance assessment day as a result of actual

ATI

or maintenance income details being received or a non-lodger determination (

6.4.3.20

).

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 71A(1) No entitlement to advance, section 71A(2) Overpayment

Retrospective variation to FTB Part A rate

If it is retrospectively determined for a past period (such as a previous period in the current year, or an earlier income year upon FTB reconciliation) that an individual's FTB Part A rate (including the supplement if relevant) before any advance repayments was actually less than the previous advance repayment amount for any part of the repayment period, but the advance assessment day is unaffected by the determination, this results in an unrepaid amount of the advance.

Note:

This includes retrospective assessments due to FTB reconciliation and circumstance debts, but excludes non-lodger determinations.

If the individual remains legislatively entitled in the current year to FTB Part A instalments when the unrepaid amount is identified, then no advance debt will arise. See

1.2.8.20

for further explanation.

If no ongoing legislative entitlement to FTB Part A exists when the unrepaid amount is identified, the unrepaid amount is raised as an FTB advance debt.

Variations to FTB advance repayment period

Repayment period has become unreasonable

Where an individual receives an FTB advance and, due to a change in estimated income and/or other circumstances, their ongoing FTB Part A rate reduces to below the base standard rate for one child under 18, the Secretary has the discretion to raise any outstanding advance balances as an FTB advance debt. For example, this discretion is exercised where the change in the FTB Part A rate results in the repayment period becoming unreasonably lengthy. If the length of the repayment period exceeds 2 years from the day the Secretary determines the increased repayment period, it could be considered unreasonable and the outstanding advance balance could be raised as an advance debt. Further, if the number of days remaining after recalculation is between 1 and 2 years, the Secretary may also exercise this discretion. However, this should only occur after examining an individual's circumstances to determine whether it may be appropriate to continue repayments at the lower rate.

If a non-lodger determination affects a period where an advance was being repaid, then an advance debt is raised for the amount of advance initially repaid during the non-lodger period.

If the individual's non-lodger status is subsequently resolved, the advance debt is taken never to have been an advance debt.

4.7.2 CCS & ACCS additional absences

Introduction

Additional absences are absences taken for specified reasons, once all allowable absences have been accessed by a child for the financial year (

1.1.A.05

).

CCS

and

ACCS

are payable for additional absences. There is no limit on the number of additional absences that may be accessed each financial year, as long as the absence is for a specified reason and supporting documentation, if required, is provided.

Additional absence reasons

The specified reasons for additional absences are:

the child, the individual who cares for the child, the individual’s partner (

1.1.P.30

) or another person with whom the child lives is ill and the service has been given a medical certificate by a medical practitioner

the child is attending preschool

alternative care arrangements have been made on a pupil-free day (for example, the child attends a different service of the same provider if their normal service is temporarily closed)

the child has not been immunised against an infectious disease, the absence occurs during an immunisation grace period and a medical practitioner (

1.1.M.40

) has certified that exposure to the infectious disease would pose a health risk to the child

the absence is because the child is spending time with a person other than the individual who is their usual carer as required by a court order or a parenting plan (

1.1.P.20

), and the service has a copy of the relevant court order or parenting plan for the child

the child cannot attend because of a period of emergency (for example, because they are unable to travel to the service), for up to 28 days after the emergency

the individual who cares for the child has decided the child should not attend the service for up to seven days immediately following the end of a period of emergency.

1.1.M.25 Maximum amount (FTB advance)

Definition

In relation to an

FTB

advance payment (

1.2.8

), the maximum amount for an eligible individual who is not a member of a blended family (

1.1.B.30

) is set out in the following table.

Maximum amount of FTB advance

If 7.5% of the individual's adjusted Part A rate is …

the individual's maximum amount of family tax benefit advance is …

greater than or equal to 23.3%* of the standard rate for a child under 13 years

23.3%* of the standard rate for a child under 13 years.

less than 23.3%* and greater than 7.5% of the standard rate for a child under 13 years

7.5% of the individual's adjusted Part A rate.

less than or equal to 7.5% of the standard rate for a child under 13 years

7.5% of the standard rate for a child under 13 years.

* 23.3% of the standard rate for a child under 13 is taken to be $1,381.13 for the 2025–26 financial year.

The maximum amount of an FTB advance for an eligible individual who is a member of a blended family is their blended family percentage of the maximum amount as calculated in the table above.

If one or more previous advances are being repaid when an individual requests a new FTB advance, the maximum new advance amount is reduced by the original amount of any unrepaid advances (disregarding any outstanding advance with a balance of less than 5c).

Note:

In the table above, 'adjusted Part A rate' means the person's FTB Part A rate disregarding the FTB Part A supplement (

1.2.1

) and any reduction in their FTB Part A due to existing FTB advances. Standard rate for a child under 13 means the FTB Part A child rate for one child under 13 years of age worked out under FAAct Schedule 1 clause 7 (disregarding clauses 8 to 11 of that schedule).

Amounts worked out under this topic are rounded to the nearest cent (rounding 0.5c upwards).

2.6.5.10 CCS - individual confirmation of enrolment

Individual confirmation process

After the approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) submits an enrolment notice (

4.13.1

) for a child in the

CCSS

, the individual (

1.1.I.90

) will be notified and asked to review the enrolment details. The individual must action this request as a pre-condition to determinations of entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) being made for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) reported under that enrolment (

1.1.E.25

).

This process will confirm that the individual indicated in the enrolment notice, or their partner (

1.1.P.30

), is liable to pay for care provided to the child under the enrolment, which is a

CCS

eligibility requirement.

Additionally, as individuals' CCS or

ACCS

entitlement is paid directly to approved providers on their behalf, the parent (

1.1.P.10

) confirmation process allows inaccurate enrolment details, and enrolments submitted either in error, or fraudulently, to be identified and corrected before entitlement is paid.

This process will usually occur through Centrelink online, in person or over the phone.

The enrolment confirmation process requires the individual to do one of the following:

confirm the enrolment - if they agree that the details are correct

indicate one or more details are incorrect - if they do not reflect their arrangement with the provider, or

indicate the child is not enrolled at the service.

The approved provider will be notified of the outcome following the individual's action.

The approved provider can begin submitting session reports (

1.1.S.35

) before the individual reviews or confirms the enrolment. Once the enrolment is confirmed, the individual's CCS or ACCS entitlement will be calculated for sessions submitted and payments can begin.

Notifications to parents & providers following enrolment notice updates

The individual will receive a notification from Centrelink when their enrolment is updated by their approved provider, however they will not be required to respond to the update unless they disagree with the update, where they believe it does not reflect the terms of the

CWA

. The provider will be notified if an individual disputes an update to an enrolment, and no entitlements of determination will be made until a new update has been provided (that is, the details of the enrolment notice have been corrected).

An individual will receive a maximum of 13 weeks for an ACCS (temporary financial hardship) application.

More than one application can be considered for ACCS (temporary financial hardship).

Act reference:

FAAct

section 85CG(1) Eligibility for ACCS (temporary financial hardship)

CCSMinRules

section 12 Circumstances in which an individual is taken to be experiencing temporary financial hardship

Circumstances not considered temporary financial hardship

ACCS (temporary financial hardship) is designed to assist families experiencing financial hardship in response to events that are outside of their control. It is not intended for use on a continuing basis to support ongoing financial problems. When a determination for ACCS (temporary financial hardship) is made, the subsidy is limited to a maximum of 13 weeks.

Examples

of circumstances that do not constitute financial hardship can include, but are not limited to:

foreseeable expenditure such as routine home repairs and maintenance

discretionary expenditure that is not essential

increases in child care fees.

Substantial reduction in the ability to pay child care fees

To be eligible for ACCS (temporary financial hardship), individuals will need to provide evidence to demonstrate there is a link between the temporary financial hardship circumstance/s they are experiencing and the substantial reduction in their ability to pay child care fees.

Some of the temporary financial hardship circumstances relate to things that may have happened to the individual, while others allow for a partner's circumstances to also be taken into account where the partner's circumstances can be expected to have a direct impact on the individual's ability to pay child care fees.

Defining debt

A person (

1.1.P.80

) incurs an FA debt if they are paid an amount of FA:

to which they were not entitled, or

that is more than the amount of assistance that should have been paid to the person under the FA law.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

Part 4 Division 2 Amounts recoverable under this Act, section 71(1) No entitlement to amount, section 71(2) Overpayment

Debts due to the Commonwealth

An overpayment of FA is a debt due to the Commonwealth if it is a debt under the:

FA(Admin)Act, or

Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990

.

Act reference:

FAAct

Part 3 Eligibility for family assistance (other than CCS and ACCS)

FA(Admin)Act

section 70 Debts due to the Commonwealth

Policy reference:

FA Guide

7.1.2

FA debts - individuals & ACOs,

7.1.3

FA debts - CCS approved providers

Types of FA debts

There are 4 main types of FA debts:

Qualification debts: A debt that results from an individual (

1.1.I.90

) receiving a payment for which they were not eligible.

Example:

An individual receives FA and it is later determined through data-matching that they were not a resident of Australia and were therefore not qualified to receive the payment.

Circumstance debts: Debts that may result from changes in a person's circumstances.

Example:

If there is a change in care arrangements for an

FTB

child and the individual continues to receive payment on behalf of that child based on previous care arrangements, an overpayment may be incurred as a result of the change in the person's circumstances.

Reconciliation debts: Overpayments that result from an underestimation of family income. FTB individuals who receive payments as fortnightly instalments usually paid on the basis of an estimate of

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) for an income (financial) year. The payment is reconciled at the end of the income year, after the individual and/or their partner (

1.1.P.30

) have lodged an income tax return, if required to do so, and the returns have been assessed by the ATO. If an individual received more FTB than they were entitled to receive for that income year, they would incur a reconciliation debt. This is also applicable for individuals who receive CCS or ACCS as fee reductions, and an underestimation of family income may result in a reconciliation debt. Reconciliation debts can also be raised for retrospective changes in circumstances.

Non-lodger debts: A non-lodger debt can occur where an FTB individual or their partner has not lodged an income tax return within the prescribed time. When an FTB individual receives FTB payments based on an estimated income and/or maintenance income during the income year and if they and/or their partner are required to lodge an income tax return for that year and they have not done so by 30 June of the lodgement year, the entire amount of FTB paid to them for the relevant income year may be raised as a non-lodger debt to the Commonwealth.

Identifying overpayments

FA overpayments may be identified in several ways including:

through the end of year reconciliation process

by the individual or

ACO

notifying Centrelink that their circumstances have changed (see example 1), or

by compliance activities undertaken by Centrelink, the Department of Education or the ATO (see example 2).

Example 1:

The person advises of a change of circumstances several weeks after the event occurred.

Example 2:

Data-matching with other agencies such as the Department of Home Affairs.

Generally, an overpayment arises when an individual has been paid:

FA when they were not eligible for the whole, or part of the period, or

more FA than they were entitled to receive.

Raising overpayments

FA overpayments can be raised when there are changes in eligibility or changes in circumstances.

An overpayment due to eligibility that does not require verification of income details to accurately raise the overpayment is raised immediately and is not left until the reconciliation process.

Where available information suggests that changes in an individual's circumstance is likely to result in an overpayment, the overpayment should be raised immediately.

Recovering overpayments

If an overpayment of FA has been identified, and it is a debt due to the Commonwealth, the amount of the debt is normally recovered. For discussion on the various methods of debt recovery, refer to

7.2

.

There are limited circumstances where recovery action for a debt is not taken, and the debt may be written off or waived. These are discussed in

7.3

.

Centrelink & ATO responsibilities in relation to debts

Centrelink is responsible for identifying, raising and recovering FA debts. This includes offsetting FA top-ups against FA debts.

The ATO will offset an available tax refund (of the individual and/or any consenting person) against any FTB and/or CCS or ACCS debt to the extent of the available tax refund. Centrelink is responsible for recovering any remaining FTB and/or CCS or ACCS debt after any tax refund has been applied to the debt.

Non-recoverable debts

Recovery of debt from FTB individuals subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate

All individuals who are subject to a prohibition on being paid FTB based on an estimate will continue to be subject to any existing debt recovery action for their FA debts (that may include a non-lodger debt), with the exception of mandatory withholding, which will cease for as long as the prohibition is in place.

Example:

Melissa is currently having $25 withheld from her fortnightly FTB instalment payments to repay an FA debt. Melissa becomes subject to a non-lodger decision resulting in a non-lodger debt and becomes subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate. Melissa's fortnightly instalment payments and her withholdings will cease, and new arrangements will need to be made to repay her FA debts.

CCS & ACCS debts

The primary circumstances in which a CCS or ACCS debt is incurred are:

when the payee has no entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) (including where the payment is made to an incorrect account)

an overpayment has been made to an individual or an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) (ACCS (child wellbeing))

the individual or approved provider makes a false or misleading statement

a payment was made to a person incorrectly

an approved provider failed to pass on or remit fee reductions

a business continuity payment was made to an approved provider and must be recovered for sessions of care (

1.1.S.40

) provided in the period specified in the notice, or

where the provider's approval or approval in respect of a service is suspended, cancelled or varied.

The FA(Admin)Act allows for the liability for a debt to be moved from an approved provider to an individual and from an individual to an approved provider under certain circumstances.

Debts incurred under the CCB and CCR arrangements may be transferred to be a treated as a CCS debt.

Notice of debts

If a debt due to the Commonwealth has not been paid in full, Centrelink or the Department of Education, Skills and Employment must give the person a notice in respect of the debt.

The notice must specify:

the date the notice was issued

the reason for the debt

the period to which the debt relates

the debt amount

the day the amount is due and payable, that is, 28 days after the date of the notice

that an interest charge may be applied to the debt if the person does not enter into a payment arrangement and make a payment under that arrangement

that an interest charge may be applied to the debt if the person fails to comply with a payment arrangement or the payment arrangement is terminated

payment options, and

contact details for enquiries concerning the debt.

More than one notice may be issued in relation to a debt.

7.3.2.10 Waiving a debt arising from administrative error

Summary

This topic provides information about waiving (

1.1.W.10

) a debt (

1.1.D.60

) caused (directly or indirectly) by an administrative error, and where the person received the payment in good faith. The topic discusses:

what is administrative error

debts arising solely from administrative error

what is good faith, and

severe financial hardship (

1.1.S.45

).

What is administrative error?

An administrative error is an action by the Commonwealth that may cause or contribute to an individual incurring a debt.

Example:

Coding errors, or incorrect processing of information.

In some cases, a debt will be the result of a combination of administrative error and the debtor's actions. Only the part of the debt clearly identified to be caused by an administrative error may be waived.

Explanation:

Where Centrelink uses inaccurate information provided by an individual to determine that person's

FA

entitlement, and it is determined that there is no administrative error, the debt cannot be waived.

Debts arising solely from administrative error

The part of a debt that can be waived under this provision is called the 'administrative error proportion' of the debt. The administrative error proportion can be up to 100% of the amount of the debt.

The administrative error proportion of the debt must have been caused or contributed to by an administrative error made by the Commonwealth, for example, a decision made by a delegate of the Secretary. If the debtor has contributed in any way to the cause of the debt, that part of the debt cannot be waived under this provision.

The administrative error proportion of the debt must be waived if:

the payment was received in good faith and recovery of the debt would cause the debtor severe financial hardship, or

the payment was received in good faith and the debt has been raised in either of the periods below (whichever ends last)

after the end of the next income year following the income year in which the eligibility period or event which gave rise to the payment of FA occurs, or

more than 13 weeks from the day the FA payment was made that gave rise to the debt.

Example:

Caitlin claims

FTB

for a past period through Centrelink for the previous income year. Caitlin receives a lump sum payment 2 weeks later. However, 4 months later, Centrelink realises that Caitlin had been incorrectly paid due to a computer error. Caitlin was not entitled to the payment and even though she had provided the correct information, a computer error led to a wrong determination of entitlement. If Centrelink determines that Caitlin received the payment in good faith, as she provided all the relevant information, and recovering the debt would result in severe financial hardship for Caitlin, the debt can be waived under FA(Admin)Act section 97(2).

The debt must be waived under section 97(3) of the FA(Admin)Act if Centrelink determines that:

there was an administrative error

the payment was received in good faith, and

the debt was raised more than 13 weeks after the payment was made or after the end of the next income year following the income year in which the eligibility period or event occurs.

Example:

Elisabeth was paid FTB by instalment during the 2019-20 income year (the eligibility period). On 8 August 2021 Centrelink discovers that a computer error has resulted in Elisabeth being paid more than she was entitled to in the 2019-20 income year. Consequently, a debt is raised on 8 August 2021. The debt is raised after the end of the 2020-21 income year, which falls at the end of the next income year after the one in which the eligibility period for FTB occurred (this is later than 13 weeks after the payment was made). If Centrelink determines that Elisabeth received the payment in good faith, the debt must be waived. Severe financial hardship consideration is not required in this instance.

If the debt is raised within 13 weeks of the reassessment or before the end of the income year following the income year in which the eligibility or event occurs, whichever is the latter, then the debt could only be waived if the person would suffer severe financial hardship. Severe financial hardship is to be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 97 Waiver of debt arising from error

What is good faith?

Receiving a payment in good faith implies that an individual has no knowledge, or reason to believe, that they were not entitled to receive a payment and they have not directly or indirectly contributed to the debt situation. If a person knew or had reason to know that they were not entitled to a payment they have received, they cannot be said to have received the payment in good faith.

In determining whether a person received an amount in good faith, the Commonwealth must look at what the person actually knew, rather than what they could reasonably have been expected to know.

A person may still receive a payment in good faith even if they knew there was a variation to their payment. It is essential to consider all the circumstances of the case, including:

information given to the individual in the form of letters and other literature, interviews, and phone contact, which may help to establish the individual's reasonable expectation about their payments

information provided by the individual about their circumstances, which may help establish the individual's expectations about future payments and the impact of any new information they provided to Centrelink

the individual's regular pattern of payment - what would they reasonably expect to receive on a regular basis? What would be an unexpected payment or amount?

the amount of the excess payment - a large amount might be expected to be questioned by the individual

the period of time the incorrect payments were made over - a short period could be considered by the individual to be administrative delay in actioning new information while a longer period may not.

Note:

It is also important to consider whether the person has been 'wilful' or 'negligent' in relation to the overpayment.

Explanation:

This means that Centrelink may consider whether the individual has been aware of an irregularity in payment but has failed to take steps to bring the situation to Centrelink's attention.

Severe financial hardship

The administrative error portion of an FA debt must be waived if the payment/s were received in good faith and the person would suffer severe financial hardship if the debt were not waived.

In considering whether an individual could face severe financial hardship, details of their income and expenditure should be examined. Once details about income and expenses have been examined, other debt recovery options such as lower repayment arrangements or a write-off, which might enable a person to repay their debt without causing them severe financial hardship, should then be considered. If any of those options are unsuitable for the individual, the debt should then be waived.

2.7 Entitlement to FTB advance payment

Entitlement to

FTB

advance

Individuals who receive FTB Part A by fortnightly instalments may request an FTB advance payment. The individual's ongoing FTB Part A payments are then reduced to repay the advance payment.

An individual is entitled to receive an FTB advance if:

they make an effective request for an FTB advance, and

on the advance assessment day (

1.1.A.55

)

they are entitled to be paid FTB by instalment (

1.1.I.100

)

they have at least one FTB child

their legislative rate of FTB Part A before any existing advance reductions is equivalent to at least the base standard rate for one child aged under 18

the amount of advance that the individual would be entitled to is at least the minimum amount

if determining a regular advance (

1.2.8

), the previous regular advance was repaid within 182 days

the Secretary considers, on the basis of the information available on the assessment day, that the daily reduction amount to repay the advance will not cause the individual to suffer financial hardship, and

the individual is not excluded from being paid an FTB advance.

An individual is excluded from being paid an FTB advance if:

they have not repaid a previous advance payment that was paid to them more than 12 months before the advance assessment day (including old advances that are now being repaid as a notional new advance)

they are subject to prohibition of FTB based on an estimate (

6.4.3.40

), or

they owe a debt to the Commonwealth which is recoverable under FA(Admin)Act Part 4 by deductions from their FTB instalments.

Debts written-off because they are irrecoverable by law or due to an ex partner non-lodger will not preclude an advance.

When an individual requests an advance and they share the care of their child/ren with another individual, their shared care rate of FTB Part A, before any existing advance reductions, must be equivalent to at least the base standard rate for one child under 18 in order to be eligible for an advance.

An FTB advance cannot be granted to an individual with a regular care child only (

2.1.1.13

). Where an individual is granted an advance and their children subsequently become regular care children, as long as the individual's annual rate of FTB Part A is greater than nil before any advance reductions (due to still being in receipt of FTB Part A components such as

RA

), the advance will generally continue to be repaid (subject to

7.6

).

Entitlement to, and the maximum amount of, an FTB advance is calculated based on an individual's rate of FTB Part A on the advance assessment day. This rate is the individual's FTB Part A entitlement prior to any existing advance rate reductions being applied. The individual's rate of FTB Part A includes all components such as

MBA

and RA, but excludes the FTB Part A supplement.

FTB advance requests

An FTB advance request can be made in person, via telephone, in writing or online. When a request is made Centrelink makes a determination as to whether to grant the request using the criteria in the section above. Centrelink may seek to obtain additional documentation from an individual in order to determine the request.

An individual may withdraw or vary a request for an FTB advance if the advance has not yet been determined.

Act reference:

FA(Admin)Act

section 33 Request, section 34 Form of request, section 35 Request may be withdrawn or varied

Assessment of financial hardship

Upon receipt of an application for an FTB advance, an assessment of the individual's ability to afford the applicable rate reduction is made considering their current income and expenses. When there is a question about the individual's capacity to afford the rate reduction following receipt of an advance, a discussion should occur. The purpose of the discussion is to satisfy Centrelink that an application considered 'doubtful' would not result in the applicant suffering hardship during the advance repayment period.

A discussion should generally occur when:

the income left after deducting expenses does not cover the rate of repayment applicable to the advance amount requested

there have been instances of misrepresentation or problems with repayment of an earlier advance (for example, reduced or suspended repayment applied), or

amounts owed (for example, other financial commitments) are high and may affect capacity to live on reduced fortnightly payments.

When assessing an individual's ability to afford an advance, the following things may be considered:

assessing hardship, and

considering changed or reorganised circumstances.

An advance cannot be paid to an individual if there is reason to believe that the reduction in their ongoing FTB Part A rate would result in financial hardship.

The income and expenses stated by the individual should provide sufficient information upon which to base a decision on an individual's capacity to afford the advance, unless the individual:

states unreasonable amounts

has a history of hardship applications or referrals to external agencies for help, or

has a history of problems associated with repaying an earlier advance payment.

The individual should have the right of reply before this information is relied on to make a decision.

In addition, if the individual has a current FTB or income support advance with a reduced or suspended repayment arrangement in place, this is taken as an indication of a limited capacity to afford an advance, and subsequent advances should not be granted, including regular advances (

1.2.8

). A reduced or suspended repayment applied to a previous advance that has been fully repaid may also be an indication of hardship, but will not necessarily preclude eligibility for a further advance.

Accessible family income or amounts owed (which could affect the likelihood of hardship arising) should be considered after calculating the gap between income and expenses. Individuals with debts not owed to the Commonwealth will have their fortnightly net income, minus any other debt repayments, taken into account when assessing affordability.

Generally, rejecting an application for an advance because of affordability should only occur if the individual is not left with enough funds to cover existing regular expenses that are largely beyond their control. In these cases, individuals should be given the opportunity to reorganise their finances to see if they can cope with the reduction. Individuals must explain how any changes are reasonable and achievable. Where the changes are neither reasonable nor achievable, generally the application should be rejected.

Individuals rejected on hardship grounds, who apply again with changed income and expenses, should be treated in the same way as those who choose to reorganise their finances.

If it is determined that the advance amount requested may cause financial hardship, the individual will generally not be entitled to that specific advance amount. However, the individual is able to be granted a lower amount (that is not lower than the minimum amount) if the lower amount would not cause financial hardship. The individual does not have to make a 'new request' for the lower amount.

Individuals whose FTB advance requests are rejected on hardship grounds may be referred to Commonwealth Financial Counselling as appropriate.

Commonwealth Financial Counselling

Existing processes and triggers will be used to identify individuals who receive FTB advance and who may benefit from a referral to Commonwealth Financial Counselling. These referrals operate in the exact same manner as any other referral to Commonwealth Financial Counselling.

However, in addition, families with repeated requests for advances are assessed to see whether they could benefit from financial support and counselling. There is no strict definition of 'repeated advances', but an example might be where an individual requests several advances within a 6 month period and they already have their maximum advance amount outstanding. A referral should also be considered if the individual's request for an advance is rejected or the amount of advance granted is lower than the amount requested.

Example:

Ewan calls Centrelink and requests an advance. Centrelink service officer Amy, checks Ewan's eligibility, and discovers that he has had 4 rejected advance requests in the past 6 months as he is still repaying 2 other advances whose combined original amounts equal Ewan's maximum advance amount. Ewan has also attempted to change his FTB payment date twice in the last 6 months, and has recently cancelled all his Centrepay deductions. Amy is unable to grant any further advances, but given the information available on Ewan's record, she suggests he may benefit from a referral to Commonwealth Financial Counselling. Ewan accepts her offer and Amy processes a referral as per normal procedures.

3.1.5.60 When maintenance action is not applicable

Maintenance action not applicable

There are certain categories of children and individuals to which maintenance action does not apply. Maintenance action is not applicable in relation to the child if:

the child

is in the individual's care for less than 35% of the time (less than 128 nights a year)

was conceived via an artificial conception procedure (ACP) and the birth parent did not have a partner at the time of conception (or their partner did not consent to the procedure) depending on the circumstances of the case (see

Artificial conception procedure (ACP) & parentage

below), or

is 18 years of age and certain circumstances apply (see

Child aged 18 years

below).

the individual

has care of the child, but is not considered to be their parent, or

is blind and receives an

Age

,

DSP

, or a service pension, veteran payment or an income support supplement under the

Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986

.

a payer is deceased.

These are discussed further in this topic.

Child is in care for less than 35% of time

If a parent has care of a child for less than 35% of the time (less than 128 nights a year), they are not required to take maintenance action as they are not entitled to claim maintenance for the child. They may however be required to pay child support.

Artificial conception procedure (ACP) & parentage

The

Family Law Act 1975

and state and territory legislation define who the parents of a child are where the child was conceived via an ACP. Generally:

the individual who gave birth to the child is the birth parent of the child

their partner who consented to the ACP is the other parent of the child, and

the donor of any genetic material (whether ovum or sperm) is not a parent of the child (unless the sperm donor is the partner of the birth parent).

There is generally a presumption that if the individual who gave birth to the child did not have a partner at the time of the ACP (or their partner did not consent to the ACP), there is no other parent of the child.

The following table provides guidance on how the

MAT

should be applied in cases of ACP, depending on whether the ACP was through a medical clinic or professional or self-administered.

ACP through a medical clinic or medical professional

Individuals who have conceived a child via ACP through a medical clinic or medical professional should have documentation from the clinic or medical professional that the ACP took place. Such documentation can be accepted as verification of the ACP.

If at the time the child was conceived, the birth parent did not have a partner (or their partner did not consent to the ACP), generally, there is no other parent of the child. The decision maker should also confirm that there is no other parent named on the child's birth certificate. If this is the case, the birth parent would not be entitled to claim maintenance for the child and, therefore they would not be required to take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate of

FTB

Part A for the child.

If at the time the child was conceived, the birth parent had a partner and their partner consented to the ACP, generally, their partner is the other parent of the child. If the birth parent and the other parent subsequently separate, they would probably be entitled to claim maintenance from each other. Therefore, to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for the child, it is likely the parent/s would need to take reasonable maintenance action.

Self-administered ACP

If an individual claims that a child was conceived via self-administered ACP, it is unlikely that the individual has any third party verification of the procedure. If this is the case, the child's birth certificate should be checked, and the parents listed on the birth certificate would be presumed to be the parents of the child.

If at the time the child was conceived, the birth parent did not have a partner (or their partner did not consent to the ACP), it is unclear whether there is another parent of the child and, if there is, who the other parent is. In this case, the child's birth certificate should be checked, and the parent/s listed on the birth certificate would be presumed to be the parent/s of the child. If there is doubt, the case should be referred to the Registrar for a decision on whether the individual is able to apply for an administrative assessment under child support legislation. Before referring the case to the Registrar, the Secretary should consider whether any MAT exemptions apply (

3.1.5.70

).

If Child Support determines that the individual is entitled to claim maintenance in relation to the child, the individual must take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A for the child unless a MAT exemption applies (

3.1.5.70

). If Child Support determines that the individual is not entitled to claim maintenance in relation to the child, the individual is not required to take reasonable maintenance action to receive more than the base rate for the child.

Child aged 18 years

There are 3 circumstances where maintenance action does not apply to a child aged 18 years. These are where:

the child is a senior secondary school child, but the child has completed the last day of school in the year in which the child turned 18

the child is a senior secondary school child but the child is exempt from the FTB activity test, or

the above 2 points do not apply, but there was never an entitlement to maintenance in relation to the child before the child turned 18.

Maintenance action is not applicable in the first 2 situations described above as maintenance is not available through Child Support where the child has turned 18 and is not in full-time secondary education. In the third situation above, maintenance action is not applicable as maintenance cannot be claimed after a child turns 18.

Note:

Maintenance action does apply where a senior secondary school child has turned 18, they are still in school and the school year in which the child turned 18 has not ended and an individual was entitled to maintenance in relation to the child before the child's 18th birthday. This is because, in these circumstances, maintenance can be extended by application to Child Support before the child's 18th birthday, until the end of the school year.

). This also applies if the individual's partner is permanently blind and receiving one of these payments.

If an individual (or their partner) is permanently blind and receives Age, DSP, or a service pension, veteran payment or income support supplement under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and is receiving maintenance, it is not assessed under the maintenance income test for FTB Part A.

1.1.F.58 FTB child rate reduction period

Definition

The

FTB

child rate reduction period is the period in which an individual's FTB child rate (

1.1.F.57

) is reduced if the health check or immunisation requirements are not met for a child.

An individual's FTB child rate for a child that does not meet the health check requirements before the day the child turns 5 will be reduced from that day (or any later day determined by Centrelink) until the end of the FTB child rate reduction period for the child. The FTB child rate reduction period commences the day of the child's fifth birthday and continues for the number of days in the income year in which the child turned 4 that the individual was entitled to be paid FTB and the individual or their partner received an income support payment.

The FTB child rate paid by instalment for a child that does not meet the immunisation requirements by the end of a 63 day grace period will be reduced during the FTB child rate reduction period. The FTB child rate reduction period commences the day Centrelink notifies the individual that a child does not meet the immunisation requirements and ends the day the immunisation requirements are met for the child. Where an individual claims FTB for a past period and the child does not meet the immunisation requirements on the day the claim is determined, the individual's FTB rate for that child is reduced as a lump sum. This applies both to lump sum claims as well as instalment claims that have a past period component.

Example:

Nic's child misses a scheduled vaccination while he is receiving FTB by instalment. Consequently, Nic receives a letter from Centrelink notifying him of his failure to meet the immunisation requirements and initiating a 63 day grace period in which he can do so. Nic fails to get his child immunised by the end of the 63 day grace period. In this case, the FTB child rate reduction period begins on the date of commencement of the grace period (being the date of the letter notifying him of his failure to meet the immunisation requirements).

Example:

Natalia lodges a past period lump sum FTB claim for the previous income year. At the date her claim is determined, Natalia's child has missed their most recent immunisation deadline. In this case, the FTB child rate reduction period is the entire income year for which Natalia is claiming FTB.

Example:

Tali's son, Jacob, was born on 1 July 2021. She lodged an FTB instalment claim on 1 November 2021. Her instalment claim was accompanied by a past period claim for the period 1 July 2021. The claim was determined on 15 November 2021. According to the vaccination schedule, Jacob was due for vaccination by 1 October 2021. As Tali failed to have Jacob vaccinated by the time her claim was determined a grace period applies from 15 November 2021 and a rate reduction will apply for the past period 1 July to 14 November 2021.

3.1.7.14 Notional assessments

Summary

This topic provides information about the use of notional assessments in the maintenance income test (MIT) for child support agreements made on or after 1 July 2008. It covers the following topics:

notional assessments

private collect agreements

Child Support collect agreements

treatment of child support arrears, and

significant changes to binding agreements.

For child support agreements, Child Support will work out the annual rate of child support that would otherwise be payable under the child support formula if there was no agreement. This is called the 'Child Support notional assessment' because it is a 'notional' rather than an actual rate of child support. The notional assessment is determined by Child Support in the same manner as a child support assessment, and is the annual rate of child support that would be paid if the agreement was not in place. Once a child support agreement is accepted, calculation of

FTB

will be based on the notional assessment.

Example 1:

Michael and Jane have registered for collection by Child Support a binding child support agreement for their son, Thomas. They have agreed that Michael will pay an annual rate of $4,000 in child support. The Child Support notional assessment is $5,000. The $5,000 is the amount that would have been payable had the agreement not been made. When applying the MIT in calculating Jane's FTB Part A rate, the notional amount of $5,000 will be used instead of the actual agreement amount of $4,000.

Example 2:

Jason and Rachel have registered for collection by Child Support a binding child support agreement for their son, Lee. They have agreed that Jason will pay an annual rate of $6,000 in child support. The Child Support notional assessment is $4,000. The $4,000 is the amount that would have been payable had the agreement not been made. When applying the MIT in calculating Rachel's FTB Part A rate, the notional amount of $4,000 will be used instead of the actual agreement amount of $6,000.

Act reference:

FAAct

Schedule 1 clause 20B(2) Individual taken to have received notional assessed amount

CSA Act

section 146A Simplified outline

Private collect agreements

If a child support agreement is made on or after 1 July 2008 and the child support is collected privately, the MIT for FTB Part A will use the notional amount of child support rather than the agreement amount.

Where a payee collects their child support through private arrangements, FTB will be calculated by using 100% of the notional assessed amount of child support. This is because it is assumed the payee will collect 100% of the child support liability.

Example:

In Michael and Jane's example above, the notional amount of child support ($5,000) would be used in the MIT for FTB Part A to work out Jane's rate of FTB Part A.

Child Support collect agreements

If a child support agreement is made on or after 1 July 2008 and the child support is registered for collection by Child Support, special rules apply if less than 100% of the child support amount payable under the agreement is collected.

Where a payee arranges for child support to be collected by Child Support, FTB is assessed on the notional amount paid. This is a percentage of the notional assessment, where the percentage is the proportion of the agreement amount collected by Child Support and divided by the agreement amount.

If less than 100% of the agreement amount of child support is collected, the MIT will not use 100% of the notional amount. Instead, a percentage of this amount that is equal to the percentage of the agreement amount received is used.

Example 1:

Mary's notional assessment amount is $20,000 but she makes an agreement with her ex-partner to receive $10,000 in child support for her 8 year old daughter. Over the income year, Mary only receives $5,000 from Child Support. To work out what amount should be used for the MIT, the amount collected ($5,000) is divided by the agreement amount ($10,000). This works out to be 50%. As Mary only received 50% of her agreement amount, only 50% (or $10,000) of the notional assessment amount ($20,000) is used for the MIT.

Example 2:

Alex and Maria have a child support agreement and payments are registered for collection by Child Support. They have agreed that Maria is to receive an annual rate of $8,000 in child support from Alex. The notional amount of child support is $5,000. Child Support collects $6,000 in child support payments from Alex. This is equal to 75% of Alex and Maria's agreement amount of $8,000. This means that, when working out Maria's rate of FTB Part A, the MIT will use 75% of the notional amount of $5,000. That is, $3,750 will be used instead of the notional assessment amount of $5,000.

Provisional notional assessments

Once Child Support accepts a child support agreement, a provisional notional assessment must be made. This assessment is calculated taking into account both parents

ATI

and their most recent care details available for the children. Child Support must notify both parties of the provisional notional assessment, and both parties are entitled to seek variation of this.

A provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment either:

14 days after the notice of the provisional notional assessment is received by all parties, or

if an application for variation was lodged, then on the day which it is varied, or is refused to be varied.

It is only once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment that it is used to calculate the FTB Part A entitlement.

A subsequent provisional notional assessment will be made where:

the child support agreement (

3.1.6.45

) remains in force and it is 3 years since the notional assessment was last calculated

the child support payable under the child support agreement (binding or limited) changes by more than 15%, or

there is a limited agreement, and either party has requested a new provisional notional assessment.

Notional assessments

Treatment of child support arrears

If the payee receives more than the agreement amount, FTB is calculated on the notional assessed amount plus the additional amount received. The additional amount of child support is treated as actual arrears or, if there had been an underpayment of child support in a previous financial year, notional arrears.

Where there has been an underpayment, the notional factor is calculated, which ensures that any arrears received will have the same effect as if the child support had been paid in the financial year it was due. If there has been an underpayment in more than one financial year, the arrears will affect the oldest underpayment amount first.

The notional factor is the amount of the notional assessment not paid, divided by the actual agreement amount that has not been paid.

Example:

If the agreement amount is $4,000 and only $3,000 is collected, and the notional assessment is $5,000 then:

the proportion of the agreement amount collected is 75%, which is equal to a notional amount paid of $3,750 (that is, 75% of $5,000)

the notional factor is calculated by dividing the notional amount underpaid by the agreement amount underpaid: $1,250 ($5,000 less $3,750) divided by $1,000 ($4,000 less $3,000). That is, a notional factor of 1.25.

Any arrears payments are multiplied by the notional factor to give the notional arrears amount. The payee's FTB is calculated on the notional assessed amount plus the notional arrears amount received.

Example:

A child support agreement provides for payment of an annual child support amount of $4,000. Child Support collects the child support payments. At the end of the financial year, Child Support has collected $4,500. The notional assessment is $5,000.

In the previous financial year, Child Support collected $3,000, resulting in an underpayment amount of $1,000 for that year and a notional factor of 1.25 (see calculation in the above example). The additional amount of $500 collected in the current financial year, if multiplied by the notional factor, equals a notional arrears amount of $625 ($500 × 1.25). The payee's FTB would be calculated on the notional assessed amount of $5,000 plus the notional arrears amount of $625. The year 1 underpayment is reduced from $1,000 to $500, and the year 1 notional factor remains at 1.25.

If more than the agreement amount is collected and the payer does not have an underpayment from a previous financial year, FTB will be based on the notional assessment plus the additional amount received as actual arrears.

Example:

The agreement amount is $3,000 and $4,500 is collected. The full agreement amount of child support has been collected in previous financial years. The notional assessment is $5,000. FTB will be based on $5,000 plus the additional amount received of $1,500, that is $6,500.

Significant changes to binding agreements

Liable parent under binding agreement increases their level of care to more than 65%

From 1 July 2018, if the care arrangements of a child change significantly so that the liable parent under the binding agreement now has over 65% care of a child, the agreement will be suspended for 28 days, or up to 26 weeks in some cases, from when the change in care occurs. The agreement will then terminate, unless the former carer entitled to child support under the agreement regains care while the agreement is suspended.

If there was a child support assessment in place under the formula before the binding agreement was made, child support will be payable according to the provisions of the formula while the agreement is suspended, rather than the notional assessment that was in place while the agreement was active. The

MAT

requirement would be satisfied and the MIT would be calculated according to the actual amount payable under the formula.

If the binding agreement started the child support case, there is no underlying formula assessment that takes effect during the suspension. Reasonable maintenance action needs to be taken within 13 weeks to satisfy the MAT. To receive child support payments for the child, the parent who is an eligible carer would need to apply for an assessment under child support formula provisions since there is no assessment that existed before the child support agreement. Once this action is taken, the MIT will be based on the formula assessment.

Example:

Alexander and Nina have a child support assessment based on the formula for their child Sofia. Alexander and Nina subsequently enter into a binding child support agreement for child Sofia. Alexander has 100% care of Sofia and receives FTB. The care arrangements change and Nina gains 100% care of Sofia. The agreement is suspended when the care change occurs as Alexander is no longer an eligible carer. While the agreement is suspended, child support is payable according to the provisions of the child support formula. Nina applies for FTB in respect of Sofia. No additional maintenance action is required and the MIT is based on the amount payable under the formula rather than the notional assessment. After 28 days, Sofia has not returned to the care of Alexander, and the agreement ends with effect from the day Sofia left the care of Alexander and went into Nina’s care. Child support remains payable according to the formula, and the MIT continues to be assessed under the formula.

Example:

Sophie and Nick enter into a binding child support agreement for child Dean. Sophie and Nick have 85% and 15% care of Dean, respectively. The care arrangements change and Nick gains 100% care of Dean. The agreement is suspended when the care change occurs as Sophie is no longer an eligible carer. Because the binding agreement started the child support case, there is no underlying formula assessment that takes effect during the suspension and so neither Sophie nor Nick are liable to pay child support in respect of Dean. One week after the change of care Nick applies for FTB in respect of Dean. Two weeks later Nick elects to end the binding agreement and applies for an administrative assessment. This action has the effect of reviving the suspended agreement and allows child support to be payable according to the formula while the agreement remains suspended. Nick therefore satisfies the MAT. The MIT for Nick is based on the amount payable under the formula rather than the notional assessment. After 28 days, Dean has not returned to the care of Sophie, and the agreement ends with effect from the day Dean left the care of Sophie and went into Nick’s care. Child support remains payable according to the formula, and the MIT continues to be assessed under the formula.

Suspending a child support agreement

Changes in care where carer entitled to child support under binding agreement remains an eligible carer

If the liable parent under a binding agreement gains additional care, they cannot unilaterally end the agreement if the carer entitled to receive child support is still an eligible carer (and is still entitled to receive child support according to the terms of the agreement). The parent may seek to end the agreement and stop paying child support for that child by getting agreement from the other party to terminate the agreement or to make a new binding agreement, or by seeking a court order which sets the agreement aside. If the other party does not agree and there is no court order, the binding agreement will remain in place. The liable parent may become eligible to receive FTB as a result of the care change. While the agreement remains in effect, the MAT requirement is satisfied and the change in circumstances will be reflected after a new provisional notional assessment is created.

For the carer entitled to receive child support under the agreement, the new notional assessment could result in a decrease in the amount used in the MIT (this could reduce to nil if they are being notionally assessed to pay child support to the liable parent under the agreement). Any maintenance the liable parent is notionally assessed to receive will not be included in their MIT because they are not receiving child support under the agreement.

Example:

Roseanna and Christopher have a binding agreement in which Christopher is the liable parent. Roseanna has 100% care of their daughter Teleatha. The care arrangements subsequently change and Christopher assumes 65% care and Roseanna has 35%. Roseanna is still an eligible carer and remains entitled to receive child support under the agreement. Christopher remains liable to pay child support to Roseanna under the agreement. When a new provisional notional assessment is created, Christopher has 65% care of Teleatha and is notionally assessed to receive child support from Roseanna according to the formula. The amount Christopher is notionally assessed to receive is not used to calculate his FTB entitlement as he is still paying child support under the agreement. The amount of maintenance used to calculate Roseanna’s FTB entitlement is nil because she is still entitled to receive child support under the agreement and is notionally assessed to receive nil under the formula.

Definition

Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance (JETCCFA) was a program operating prior to 2 July 2018 to assist parents (

1.1.P.10

) who received certain income support payments (

1.1.I.50

) with the cost of approved child care (

1.1.A.90

) to undertake approved work, study or job search activities.

3.1.1.10 Calculating a rate of FTB - overview

Summary

This topic provides an overview of how the rate of

FTB

is calculated, and the income tests that may be applied. The topic discusses the following:

FTB annual rate

calculating the annual rate of FTB for an individual

annual rate of FTB for an

ACO

calculating FTB daily rate

rounding the FTB rate

minimum amount of FTB

FTB income tests, and

effect of changes in relationship status.

FTB annual rate

The FTB rate is calculated as an annual rate. For individuals (

1.1.I.90

), this annual rate is the sum of the income tested FTB Part A and FTB Part B rates, including supplements if eligible.

Note:

Although both the FTB Part A and FTB Part B supplement amounts are included in the annual rate of FTB Part A and FTB Part B respectively for eligible individuals, they cannot be paid as fortnightly instalments.

The FTB Part A supplement is subject to an income test. If an individual's

ATI

(which includes the ATI of their partner if any) is more than $80,000 for the relevant income year, then the individual's FTB Part A supplement in relation to that year will be nil.

Calculating the annual rate of FTB for an individual

The annual rate of FTB for an individual is calculated using FAAct Schedule 1. This schedule sets out the income tests for FTB Part A, FTB Part A supplement and FTB Part B respectively. These income tests assess, for an income year:

the ATI (

1.1.A.20

) of individuals and their partners (

1.1.P.30

) for FTB Part A, FTB Part A supplement and FTB Part B, and if applicable

the maintenance income (

1.1.M.10

) of the individual and their partners for FTB Part A worked out using Method 1.

Note:

Past period claims made for a period in the current financial year and payments made by instalment may be based on either the individual's estimate as agreed with Centrelink, the indexed current estimate (

1.1.I.85

) or the indexed actual incomes.

Explanation:

Centrelink may use either:

an estimate provided by the individual and assessed as reasonable by Centrelink, or

the indexed current estimate (most recent estimate of income available to Centrelink adjusted by movements in average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period), or

the indexed actual income, based on the most recent taxable income as determined by the

ATO

and adjusted by movements in average weekly earnings over the relevant 12-month period.

An individual's rate of FTB is calculated on the basis of family income. For ongoing instalment claims and past period claims made for periods in the current income year, FTB payments are determined by using an estimate of an individual and their partner's ATI and maintenance income, if applicable, for the current year. If the claim is for a previous income year payments are based on actual ATI.

Annual rate of FTB for an ACO

For ACOs (

1.1.A.80

), this annual rate is a flat rate. The annual rate of FTB for an ACO is not subject to an income test. The ACO rate is equivalent to the base rate (

1.1.B.10

) of FTB Part A for a child under 18. The FTB Part A supplement is only for individuals and cannot be paid to an ACO.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 58(2) Annual rate of FTB to approved care organisation

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.2

FTB rate for ACOs

Calculating FTB daily rate

The annual rate of FTB for an individual or an ACO is converted to a daily rate by dividing the annual rate by 365. A new daily rate is derived each time the annual rate of FTB for an individual is recalculated.

Note:

In a leap year, the daily rate is still calculated by dividing the annual rate by 365.

The daily rate of FTB is used to pay for each day of eligibility during:

a fortnight when an individual or ACO is paid FTB by instalments, or

a past period when an individual or ACO is paid FTB as a lump sum.

In general, the annual rate of FTB responds to changes in eligibility as they occur.

Example:

The rate of FTB may change in the following circumstances:

an individual's ATI is more than $80,000 (FTB Part A supplement is nil)

the number of FTB children changes

an individual is receiving

RA

and the amount of rent they pay changes

the amount of maintenance income an instalment individual receives changes, and/or

an individual separates or gets married.

Rounding the FTB rate

Each time an annual rate is converted to a daily rate, the new daily rate is always rounded to the nearest cent (for example, rounding amounts ending in 0.5c upwards to the next whole cent). If the daily rate before rounding is above nil and below half a cent, round up to 1c.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 58(3) Daily rate of FTB

Minimum amount of FTB

After rounding, the minimum amount of FTB that can be paid is 1c per day or 14c per fortnight. Individuals receiving less than $100 a year are encouraged to claim their entitlement as a lump sum after the end of the financial year.

FTB income tests

The rate of FTB Part A for an individual is subject to an income test, except where the individual or their partner receives an income support payment (where employment income has reduced the income support payment to a nil rate, the FTB income test will apply) (

1.1.I.50

). The exemption from the Part A income test for income support payment customers does not apply to partnered income support payment customers under the following circumstances:

Both are in receipt of an income support payment and both are in an employment income nil rate period.

Only one member of the couple is in receipt of an income support payment and are in an employment income nil rate period.

The rate of FTB Part A may be calculated using Method 1 or Method 2, depending on the amount of the individual's ATI. If FTB Part A is calculated using Method 1, it is also subject to the maintenance income test.

FTB Part B is calculated separately. Single parents who receive income support payments are not income tested.

Employment income nil rate period

Effect of changes in relationship status

Eligibility for FTB is based on the ATI of the individual, and their partner if they have one, for the period being claimed. If the individual's relationship status changes during the period of the claim, the income assessment must also change for the relevant period.

Example:

Suzanne lodges a lump sum claim for FTB for a previous income year. From July to September, Suzanne was partnered. From October to April she was a single parent, and from May to June she had a new partner. Her daily rate of FTB is calculated taking into account 3 different ATI assessments - the joint income with her ex-partner from July to September, her sole income from October to April, and the joint income with her new partner from May to June.

Example:

Simon is a single parent who receives FTB by instalments. He notifies Centrelink that he is moving in with his new partner, and he provides his partner's estimated ATI for the current income year. Simon's daily rate of FTB is reassessed from the date he commences the relationship, and his FTB payments are based on the combined family ATI for that income year.

2.2.2 Death of an individual eligible for FTB

Summary

This topic explains the following:

accepting the notice of the death of an instalment individual

payment in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for

FTB

date of effect of death of FTB individual

who can be paid FTB in substitution for the person who died, and

payment of FTB if the person and the child die at the same time.

An

ACO

(

1.1.A.80

) cannot be paid FTB in substitution for a person who died.

Accepting the notice of death of instalment individual

Notice that a person who was receiving FTB has died can be accepted from the person's partner (

1.1.P.30

), a family member or close friend. The following details must be obtained before action is taken to reassess the deceased person's FTB entitlement:

full name and address and contact number of the person notifying the death

full name, and date of death of the deceased person

name and address of the executor of the estate, and

at least 2 of the following

address at date of death

date of birth

customer reference number

advice from funeral director, or

death notice in a newspaper.

Centrelink must be certain of the information before taking action.

The person notifying the death should also be asked for the contact details of the person who has gained care of the FTB or regular care child/ren. The new carer should be invited to claim FTB or related benefits for the child/ren.

Payment in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for FTB

If there is an amount of FTB outstanding which would have been payable to the person who died, the accrued entitlement of FTB outstanding can be paid to someone else. This can include a period of eligibility for FTB even if the person did not claim FTB before they died. This means that the accrued amount is based on the eligibility of the person who died not the person who receives the payment.

Example:

Angela intended to claim FTB as a lump sum for her child Adam. Angela dies during the income year. Angela's mother Hesta begins caring for Adam, and lodges a claim for FTB for him. Hesta's income is lower than Angela's was. Hesta is eligible to receive the accrued entitlement of FTB based on Angela's circumstances up to the date she died, and is paid a rate of FTB based on her own circumstances from the time she begins caring for Adam.

Once an accrued entitlement has been paid to another person, no-one else is eligible or entitled to be paid that amount.

Date of effect of death of FTB individual

An individual's eligibility for FTB ceases at the end of the day before the death of that FTB individual.

Example:

Consuela was receiving FTB by instalments for her child Hector. Consuela dies on 21 March. Consuela's mother Alba begins caring for Hector immediately, and lodges a claim for FTB. Consuela's FTB is cancelled from the end of the day prior to her death, 20 March, and Alba is eligible to receive FTB from 21 March.

Calculating FTB bereavement payment

Who can be paid in substitution for the deceased person?

The most appropriate person can be paid FTB in substitution for a deceased person who was eligible for FTB. The circumstances of the case must be considered when deciding who should be paid.

If the deceased person had a partner, the partner is the most appropriate person to pay. If the person did not have a partner, the payment should be made to the executor of the estate.

If an executor has not been appointed, a relative of the deceased person or the new carer of the FTB child/ren can be paid.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

4.2.1

Summary of the FTB claim process

The person & the FTB child die at the same time

The amount of FTB outstanding can include the bereavement amount for the FTB child if it has not already been paid when a person's FTB child dies, and

the person dies at the same time, or

dies after the child died.

Where the person and the child die on the same date, it must be taken that the child died first.

Example:

Carla intended to claim FTB at the end of the income year. During the year Carla and her child are involved in a car accident. The child dies immediately, and Carla dies a week later. Carla's partner claims the accrued FTB entitlement, which includes the amount of FTB that Carla would have been eligible for up to the date she died, as well as the equivalent of a further 14 weeks FTB because the child died. The total amount is paid as a single payment to her partner.

The person & the shared care child die at the same time

If the care of the child was shared between the person who died and only one other person, the remaining carer can be paid the full bereavement payment for the child.

If the care of the child was shared between more than 2 people, the bereavement payment is shared between all the carers, including a carer intending to claim for a past period. If the child dies before the person, or dies on the same day, the bereavement payment for the child is included with the accrued entitlement that can be paid in substitution for the deceased person.

Example:

Callum and Monica share the care of their son David in a 50/50 pattern of care, and they each receive instalments of FTB for him. Callum and David are involved in an accident. Callum dies shortly afterward, and David dies a week later in hospital. Callum's current partner Rebecca is paid the accrued entitlement of FTB that would have been paid to Callum had he not died. The bereavement payment for David is paid to Monica, as he was her FTB child. The determination to share FTB entitlement ceases to have effect from the date Callum dies, which means that Monica receives 100% of the bereavement amount, rather than 50%.

1.1.S.35 Session reports (CCS)

Definition

A session report is an electronic file that is sent by an approved provider (

1.1.A.90

) to the Department of Education containing details of the sessions provided to a child for a week by the approved provider's child care service.

Submission of session reports

Providers that are approved to administer

CCS

, must submit session reports to the Department of Education for a child (for whom the provider has submitted an enrolment notice (

1.1.E.25

)) for each week in which the provider delivered at least one session of care (

1.1.S.40

) to the child.

The session report must be submitted within 14 days after the end of the week in which the session/s of care were provided.

If an enrolled child does not physically attend any sessions of care in a week, and the service is not taken to have delivered a session of care when the child was absent (

1.1.A.05

), providers can indicate this in lieu of submitting a session report (this is not a legislated requirement).

Session reports may only be submitted through either the approved provider's registered third party software program, or the Provider Entry Point.

Information included in session reports

Information required in a session report includes, amongst other things, details of the sessions of care provided, the fees charged for the sessions, the times the child arrived and left the service and other details such as whether the child was absent.

Errors in weekly session reports

It is vital that a provider submits accurate session reports on time. Inaccurate session reports can result in incorrect CCS and affect the eligible individuals and the children to whom the care relates. If there is an error in a session report, the approved provider should vary it so that it is correct and re-submit the report to the Department of Education. If a submitted session report should not have been given at all, the provider should withdraw it.

Approved providers may vary session reports no later than:

28 days after the start of the week to which the session report relates

the last day of the financial year in which the CCS fortnight (

1.1.C.10

) to which the report relates starts, or

a later day, which must be approved by the Department of Education.

Approved providers can apply through their third party software program or the Provider Entry Point for a later date to vary or withdraw previously submitted session reports to the Department of Education. A reason for the variation or withdrawal of the session reports is required.

In limited, specified circumstances, an approved provider may need to submit new session reports late, or vary or withdraw session reports in a prior financial year. In these cases, the provider must contact the Department of Education directly to apply for access.

If the Department of Education considers that a detail contained in a session report submitted by a provider might not be accurate, the department may require the provider to withdraw the report, vary it so that it becomes accurate or substitute it with an accurate report. The provider must do this within 14 days of the notice.

3.1.5.100 Role of the ISO & social worker

Referral to the

ISO

In some situations individuals may refuse or be reluctant to take action to receive child support (

1.1.C.20

) because of their cultural beliefs. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australians should be referred to an ISO for a decision to be made in consultation with a social worker about exemption (

3.1.5.70

). If it is inappropriate for an ISO to be involved in a particular case, then it may be appropriate to refer the individual to a different ISO or social worker.

Example:

It may be inappropriate for a particular ISO to be involved because of skin grouping, kinship relationships or connections the ISO may have with varying factions of the community and the fear or shame of sharing personal information.

Explanation:

Cases should also be referred to the social worker where the individual requests an exemption on the basis of a fear of violence (

1.1.F.15

) or the father is unknown. Assessment of these cases can be undertaken jointly by the ISO and social worker.

Referral to the social worker

In some situations, individuals may refuse or be reluctant to take action to receive child support. They must be referred to a social worker; even if the interviewing officer is satisfied they should be granted an exemption (

3.1.5.70

).

Example:

If there are cultural considerations that adversely impact on the individuals capacity to take reasonable maintenance action (

1.1.M.10

) and where there are exceptional circumstances, they should be referred to a social worker for an assessment of their situation and possible referral to support agencies.

Where an individual is reluctant to take action for child support, the officer should try to obtain the reasons for this. The officer should explain the advantage of the

CSS

to the individual and the requirements about taking reasonable action for child support. If the individual is reluctant to talk about the reasons, they should be referred to a social worker.

Common role of the ISO & the social worker

The ISO and the social worker should ensure the individual understands that:

child support is for the financial benefit of the child

child support improves the financial resources for children not living with both parents

children are entitled to receive support from both parents, and

child support does not have to involve contact between the parents.

The ISO or the social worker should fully explore with the individual avenues of verifying the grounds for an exemption such as:

health professionals

community agencies

legal practitioners

police

relatives, or

friends.

A letter of verification from any of these sources should be obtained wherever possible.

The social worker should complete an electronic document (DOC) indicating:

the sources of verifying the grounds for an exemption, or

why verification is not possible, and

record the outcome of exercising their delegation for a request for a child support exemption.

Specific role of the social worker

Individuals may be more willing to discuss sensitive issues or disclose information to a social worker. The social worker may be able to:

obtain some information relating to the individual which for personal reasons they are unwilling to divulge at the original interview

alleviate any fears the individual may have with regard to privacy

refer the individual for any other assistance needed, or

present the advantages of child support for children in a more positive light.

Example:

Child support is not linked with access issues and does not require personal contact between the parents.

Specific role of the ISO

When a social worker consults with an ISO to make a decision to grant or not grant an exemption, the ISO should take into account the reason the individual does not want to take action for child support and the likely impact on the individual and/or their community if action for child support is taken.

In the case of remote Aboriginal individuals who do not have a pre-grant interview, the ISO should determine whether the payer (

1.1.P.72

) is likely to be in a position to pay child support. The ISO should seek advice from community contacts if necessary.

2.1.1.45 Establishing a pattern of care

Summary

If the care percentage for a child is not agreed between carers, it is necessary to establish a pattern of care (

1.1.P.70

) to make a shared care determination for

FTB

. A pattern of care is generally established by using the number of nights in care (

1.1.N.15

) for each FTB child (

2.1.1.10

). The percentage of care for each FTB child is then calculated and applied to the standard rate (

1.1.S.103

) of FTB Part A and FTB Part B.

This topic includes the following:

how to establish a pattern of care

carers agree on pattern of care

carers disagree on pattern of care

nights in care versus hours of care, and

instalment claim - pattern of care changes.

Calculation of the percentage of care is explained in

2.1.1.50

.

How to establish a pattern of care

The pattern of care to be generally used in the shared care assessment is the actual care arrangements for the child. As much as possible, the pattern of care should be the pattern as agreed to by all parties who care for the child. Otherwise, Centrelink must carry out further investigation to determine the actual pattern of care.

An assessment of care arrangements that is determined by either Centrelink for

FA

purposes or Child Support for child support purposes will apply to the other program. This means where a care percentage has been determined by Child Support, that determination will be aligned for the purpose of FA and will be applied in determining the individual's care percentage for FTB purposes. Centrelink will only be able to make a new care determination if there has been a change in the care arrangements (

2.1.1.30

).

Carers agree on pattern of care

Where all carers agree on the actual pattern of care for the child, the agreed pattern of care is used to determine the care percentage.

Example:

Linda receives FTB for her child John. After separation, Phillip, Linda's ex-partner, claims FTB on 5 September stating they are sharing care of the child. Both parents agree that Phillip has care of the child every second weekend and school holidays and Linda has care for the remainder of the time. The pattern of care commenced on 31 August and will continue for the foreseeable future. Phillip may be granted FTB on the basis of the shared care percentage derived from the agreed pattern of care and Linda's entitlement is reassessed accordingly.

Carers disagree on pattern of care

Where the carers do not agree on the actual pattern of care for the child, Centrelink must determine the actual pattern of care on the basis of available evidence. This applies even if a formal care arrangement (

1.1.C.05

) exists. If the carers do not agree on the care percentage, each carer should be asked to provide additional evidence to support their declared arrangements in order for Centrelink to make a decision as to the actual pattern of care. Examples of evidence, which may be provided by the carers, are outlined in

2.1.1.30

.

Example:

Simone and Lucy are members of a couple. Simone receives FTB for their daughter Katia. After they separate, Lucy claims FTB on 3 May stating they are sharing the care of the child. Lucy has a family law order stating the caring arrangements for the child. Centrelink contacts Simone who states that Lucy is not complying with the order. Simone presents child care receipts and written advice from family and friends to confirm the actual care arrangements. Lucy presents no evidence of their actual care arrangements apart from the family law order. Lucy may be granted FTB with a shared care percentage based on the actual pattern of care as confirmed by the documentation provided by Simone, rather than the caring arrangements specified in the family law order (

2.1.1.70

).

Where an FTB child is being shared, all carers of the child should be consulted in making the shared care determination for the following reasons:

to ensure that each FTB recipient is paid the correct rate

the other carer may decide to claim their shared care entitlement later

the care determination may impact on the other parties' child support assessment, and

consultation at the initial stage should reduce the likelihood of reviews and appeals.

If an FTB recipient provides proof of the other carer's agreement with the stated care percentages or arrangements (for example, their signature on the form stating care details), it is not necessary to contact the other carer to verify the arrangements.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.30

Verification of shared care arrangements

Nights in care versus hours of care

A pattern of care is generally based on the number of nights in a care period that an individual has the overnight care of an FTB child. A person with the overnight care of a child is regarded as having had care of the child for that day.

Explanation:

One night in care equals one day in care.

Example:

Alison and Neil share the care of their 2 children according to a written agreement. Their current care period is from 30 April to 30 June, which is 62 nights. The children stay with Neil every second weekend starting from Friday 4 May, and the rest of the time they live with Alison. The pattern of care is worked out as follows:

Neil provides 10 weekend nights of care, and

Alison provides 52 nights of care made up of 44 week nights plus 8 weekend nights.

There may be some occasions where only counting the nights in care does not accurately reflect the caring arrangements for the child. In such cases, at the request of a carer, the actual number of hours of care may be calculated for each carer in determining the pattern of care and then converted into days in care.

Example:

William and Julia are divorced. They have 3 children. Sam attends primary school, and Pat and Louise attend a pre-school program. William and Julia do not have a formal care arrangement such as a family law order, parenting plan or written agreement, and they are unsure of their respective percentages of care.

William works full-time during the week, and Julia works part-time on Sundays. William takes the children to Julia every morning at 8 am on their way to work. Julia is responsible for the children during the day, and participates in parental activities at Sam's school. William picks the children up on their way home at 6 pm from Monday to Thursday. The children spend Friday night with Julia and Julia leaves them with William on their way to work at 8 am on Sunday. This means that Julia cares for the children from 8 am to 6 pm Monday to Thursday, as well as from 8 am on Friday, as Julia is responsible for the children during the day while they are at school. William cares for the children during the day from 8 am on Sunday, as Julia has returned them to William and he cares for them overnight on Sunday night.

Twice a year during school holidays the children spend a full week with William. Once during the end of year school holidays they spend a full 4 weeks with Julia. The care period used to determine the care percentages is 12 months from the day the care arrangements commenced, automatically renewed at the end of every 12 month period until a change in the pattern of care occurs.

The pattern of care is worked out as follows:

William provides 167.81 days of care

2 full weeks during school holidays = 14 days

During remaining 323 days of the year

(80 hours ÷ total 168 hours per week) × 323 days = 153.81 days

Therefore, 153.81 days + 14 days = 167.81 days per year

Julia provides 197 days of care

4 full weeks during school holidays = 28 days

During remaining 323 days of the year

(88 hours ÷ total 168 hours per week) × 323 days = 169.19 days

Therefore, 168.19 days + 28 days = 197.19 days per year

Instalment claim - pattern of care changes

The future pattern of care declared by a person at the time of making an instalment claim is used to determine the percentage of FTB to be paid. Minor variations to the pattern of care do not affect payment of FTB. If the variations in the care arrangements become a regular occurrence, the person must notify Centrelink and a new determination must be made of the percentage of FTB payable.

Example:

Joshua usually stays the weekends with one of their parents and lives with the other during the week. Both parents have claimed FTB by instalment. Over the care period, there are a few occasions where Joshua stays with a friend on the weekend or with other relatives during the week. These variations are not significant to either parent, so payment of FTB continues based on the 'normal' pattern of care.

The guidelines above for establishing a pattern of care at the new claim stage also apply when a carer notifies of a subsequent change to the pattern of care.

CCS eligibility criteria

Individuals' eligibility for CCS is determined in relation to each session of care delivered by an approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

). An individual is eligible for CCS for a session of care provided by an approved child care service to a child if, at the time the session is provided:

the child is a

FTB

or regular care child (

1.1.R.21

) of the individual or their partner (

1.1.P.30

)

the child is 13 years of age or under and does not attend secondary school (unless the child is a member of a class prescribed by the Minister who can be eligible despite not meeting this criteria (

2.6.2.10

))

the child meets immunisation requirements (

1.1.I.10

), and

the individual, or their partner, meets the residency requirements.

These eligibility criteria are tested when an individual makes a claim (

1.1.C.27

) for CCS. Individuals who meet these criteria receive a determination of initial eligibility. This is not an assurance of eligibility for any reported sessions of care, but establishes an individual as someone for whom entitlement (

1.1.E.30

) determinations can be made.

An individual is eligible for CCS for a session of care if, in addition to meeting the 4 criteria above:

the individual, or their partner, has a genuine liability to pay for the care under a CWA, and

the session of care

is provided in Australia (

1.1.A.120

)

is not provided as part of the compulsory education program in the state or territory where the care is provided, and

is not provided in circumstances outlined in the CCSMinRules section 8.

Liability to pay for child care under a CWA

To be eligible for CCS for a session of care an individual, or their partner, must have incurred a liability to pay for the session under a CWA. This eligibility requirement will be established when the approved provider creates the enrolment and the individual confirms the details. Once a provider and individual enter into a CWA, the provider must submit relevant details of the arrangement in an enrolment notice, including who is liable to pay the fees. These details will be passed on to the individual for confirmation (through Centrelink online).

It is possible for one member of a couple (

1.1.M.50

) to incur the liability for fees (enrol the child under a CWA), and the other member of the couple to be the CCS claimant and still meet this eligibility requirement, though their partner is incurring the liability.

Where there is no eligibility for a session of care under section 8 of the CCSMinRules

As outlined in the CCSMinRules section 8, there are circumstances where there is no eligibility for a session of care. In addition to the requirements outlined above, for an individual to be eligible for CCS for a session of care, the session of care must not be provided in the following circumstances:

where care is provided aboard a transport vehicle, including on a bus for example (unless the transport is incidental to the session of care)

except for care provided by an

IHC

service, where care is provided in a domestic living arrangement such as the child's own home or where the parent remains present

where care is provided by an individual required to hold a working with children card, but the individual does not hold a card by the time the session of care is provided or the details of the card have not been provided within the time required by the rule

where the child attends school (including home school or distance education program) during any part of the session

where the session of care is provided by an approved

FDC

child care service to a child who is a FTB child or regular care child of an FDC educator, or their partner, and the session occurs on a day the FDC educator provides care at an FDC service, unless one of the following circumstances apply

the child is an eligible disability child of the individual

the child is an eligible ISP child of the individual

the child is a remote area child of the individual, or

the FDC educator

is required to work for at least 2 hours on the care day in paid work which is not for an approved FDC service, and

has provided documentary evidence, in accordance with subsection (4), to the provider of the FDC service that the FDC educator is usually required to work at the time the session of care is provided, or

the FDC educator

is enrolled in a study or training program towards a recognised qualification (at Certificate III level or above) provided by a registered training organisation

is engaged in scheduled activities for the purposes of the program or course on the care day that overlap with the session of care, and

has provided documentary evidence to the provider of the FDC service that the FDC educator usually studies at the time the session of care is provided.

where the session of care is provided by an approved IHC child care service to a child who is a FTB child or regular care child of an IHC educator, or their partner, and the session occurs on a day the IHC educator provides care at an IHC service

where the session of care is provided to children who have one of the following relationships with an FDC or IHC educator of the FDC or IHC service, or their partner

FTB child

regular care child

foster care child

biological or adopted child

brother, sister, half brother, half sister, step brother or step sister

any other child a child for whom the FDC educator or partner has legal responsibility

where the session of care provided breaches the condition for continued approval in relation to the number of children who can be cared for by an IHC educator.

These circumstances will be established using information in session reports (

1.1.S.35

), or through compliance reviews.

Limitations on eligibility

In addition to the eligibility criteria outlined above, there are some circumstances where an individual will not be able to be eligible for CCS, such as:

Only one individual can be eligible for the same session of care provided to a child (

2.6.6.10

).

Only one individual can be eligible in substitution for an individual who has died.

There is no eligibility for a child who is in the care of a state or territory, other than where a child is in the care of a foster parent (

1.1.P.10

).

There is no eligibility for a session of care provided by an IHC service, where more than one child in a group of 5 children is the nominated child for that session of care.

An individual who is the CCS claimant cannot remain eligible for CCS (or

ACCS

) if they are overseas for in excess of 6 weeks, however the Secretary may extend the 6-week period to a period of no more than 3 years in some circumstances.

Further to the above limitation on eligibility, the CCS hourly rate cap for approved child care provided by an IHC child care service is per family, not per child like all other approved child care service types. To give effect to the family rate and family rate cap, an individual is eligible for CCS or ACCS for only one child (the nominated child) among any group of 5 children being cared for in the same session of care in the same home (

2.6.6.20

).

Act reference:

Cessation of eligibility

No session of care for 26 consecutive weeks

CCS eligibility will be cancelled if no sessions of care (attendances or absences) have been provided to the child for 26 consecutive weeks.

No intention to use child care

The Secretary may cease CCS eligibility at any time if the Secretary considers an individual does not intend that the child be enrolled in or attend sessions of care at a child care service.

Request to cease CCS eligibility

An individual can also make a request to Centrelink for their child’s CCS eligibility to be ceased in the event that the child will no longer attend child care.

No CCS entitlement paid where eligibility has ceased

If an individual does not meet any of the eligibility criteria at the time a session of care is provided, they will not be eligible to receive CCS in respect of a child for that session of care, and a determination of no entitlement for that session of care will be made.

Example:

If a child who attends approved care every weekday exceeds the immunisation grace period on the Wednesday, they would meet eligibility criteria for sessions of care delivered on Monday and Tuesday, but would not be eligible for CCS for sessions of care on and from Wednesday until they start meeting immunisation requirements again. Determinations of no entitlement would be made from Wednesday until the first session the child attends after they have started meeting immunisation requirements again (unless the individual's claim for this child ceases before the child starts meeting immunisation requirements again).

If the individual notifies Centrelink of a change in their circumstances relating to their eligibility after the change has occurred, or new information about an individual's eligibility is identified through other means, the family's entitlement will be reviewed.

2.1.2.20 Verifying residence/citizenship

Summary

If an individual receiving

FTB

and/or

SIFS

was born overseas, evidence must be obtained to verify that they are an Australian resident (

1.1.A.130

). This means that the person must:

have the right to live in Australia (

1.1.A.120

) permanently, and

intend to live in Australia permanently.

This topic explains the following:

special purpose visa.

Note:

The test used to verify residency/citizenship for

FA

purposes differs to the test used for taxation purposes. For more information please refer to the

'Are you a resident?'

page on the

ATO

's website.

Verifying the applicant is an Australian resident

Evidence must be provided by the individual that they:

are an Australian citizen, or

hold a

permanent visa

special category visa, or

special purpose visa, and

intend to remain in Australia permanently.

This is explained in the rest of this topic.

Citizenship & visas

Evidence of residency

Suitable evidence of Australian residency may include:

information obtained from the Department of Home Affairs verifying the date of arrival, residence status, etc.

a passport

a citizenship certificate, or

a visa (

1.1.V.10

) or travel documents from the Department of Home Affairs stating that the person has been granted permanent residence.

Australian citizenship

An individual may become an Australian citizen by applying for grant of Australian citizenship. A certificate of Australian citizenship is issued to approved applicants.

Explanation:

Most people born in Australia before 26 January 1949 became Australian citizens on that date when the

Australian Citizenship Act 1948

first came into force. People born in Australia on or after 26 January 1949 and before 20 August 1986 automatically became Australian citizens on their

DOB

unless one of their parents was a diplomatic or consular official of a foreign country. There is also provision for children born in Australia who would otherwise be stateless to apply for Australian citizenship by registration. Children who live in Australia until their 10th birthday acquire Australian citizenship on that birthday. A child born overseas to Australian parents, or a child adopted by Australian parents, may be registered as an Australian citizen by the child's parents at the nearest Australian Embassy or Consular post.

Policy reference:

SS Guide

3.1.1.10

Residence requirements

Permanent visa

A permanent visa gives the holder permission to remain in Australia indefinitely. An individual may apply for a permanent visa inside or outside Australia, depending on the category of visa.

Special category visa

An

SCV

is the type of visa granted to people who enter Australia on a New Zealand passport. Like a permanent visa, it allows the holder to remain in Australia indefinitely. However, New Zealand citizens entering Australia are granted the same visa regardless of whether they are entering as visitors or settlers. This is why the FA(Admin)Act requires the holder of an SCV to be also 'residing in Australia' to be eligible for FTB.

Explanation:

Prior to 1 September 1994, New Zealand citizens and certain other groups did not require a visa to enter and remain in Australia. However, since the commencement of the

Migration Reform Act 1992

, a person must be either an Australian citizen or the holder of a valid visa to be legally present in Australia.

Special purpose visa (SPV)

An SPV is the type of temporary visa granted to people with a prescribed status or who are declared by the Immigration Minister to hold such a visa, to enter and stay in Australia. An SPV allows a person to undertake their normal work while in Australia, and is granted on entry to Australia including if they are:

a member of the Royal Family (that is, the King's immediate family)

an official guest of the Australian Government or their spouse, de facto partner or dependent child

a member of the military or civilian component of the armed forces of a country that has a Status of Forces Agreement with Australia, or their accompanying spouse, de facto partner or dependent relative

a member of the armed forces of a specified Asia-Pacific or a Commonwealth country, who is travelling to Australia, or is in Australia, as part of their duty, or their accompanying spouse, de facto partner or dependent relative

a person who forms part of the complement of a ship of the regular armed forces of a foreign government and who is on board the ship, or

2.1.3.60 Healthy Start for School exemptions (FTB)

Summary

If an individual or their partner receives an income support payment (

1.1.I.50

) on any day that the individual is also receiving

FTB

Part A, and they have an FTB child that turns 4 in that income year, an age-appropriate health check must be undertaken, or an appropriate exemption must be granted, or the individual's FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period (

1.1.F.58

).

Exemptions include:

general exemptions

special circumstances exemption, and

death of an FTB individual or FTB child.

General exemptions - children taken to meet the health check requirement

Certain children will be taken to meet the health check requirement if they are in a class of children specified in a determination made by the Minister.

The Minister has specified the following classes of children:

From 1 July 2018, a child who qualifies their carer for

CP

,

CA

or a

HCC

(because the carer is qualified for CA for the child, either alone or with another care receiver) at any time from the beginning of the income year in which the child turned 4 to the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).

From 1 July 2018, a child assessed by a medical practitioner as having a severe disability or severe medical condition and who has undergone a health assessment suitable to their needs conducted by a suitably qualified health professional during the period beginning the day the child turns 3 and ending the day before the child turns 5 (or a later day determined by Centrelink which can be no later than the child's sixth birthday).

Act reference:

FAAct

section 61A(9) Legislative instrument

Family Tax Benefit (Meeting the Health Check Requirement) Determination 2018

Special circumstances exemption

If special circumstances exist in relation to an individual or their partner (or both) that make it inappropriate to arrange a health check for the child, an exemption from the requirement for the individual to arrange the health check for their child may be granted at the discretion of Centrelink. Special circumstances exemptions may be granted on or after the day the child turned 5, provided that Centrelink has been made aware of the circumstances before the child turned 5.

In deciding whether a special circumstances exemption applies, the particular facts of each case need to be considered. An exemption should only be granted in unusual and unexpected situations.

Factors that may give rise to a special circumstances exemption include, but are not limited to:

the individual's medical circumstances

issues of isolation and/or remoteness, relating to difficulties in accessing doctors/nurses or other medical practitioners to conduct health assessments, for example, where access is only available through the flying doctor service and used for emergencies only.

It will usually be a combination of factors rather than a single factor that makes the circumstances sufficiently unusual and unexpected to warrant a special circumstances exemption, and circumstances must be considered on a case by case basis. Below is an example of a situation where a special circumstances exemption should not be applied.

Example:

Cecelia lives on a remote cattle station in NT and receives FTB Part A for their child Henny, who is turning 4 in the 2023-24 income year. The nearest medical facility is several hundred kilometres away. The Royal Flying Doctor service provides remote medical services on-line and by radio and provides a visiting service at least twice a year, as well as in emergency situations. After Cecelia receives the letter informing them of the health check requirement, Cecelia requests a special circumstances exemption on the basis that they will have to wait until the next available opportunity to organise a physical check for Henny, which could be several months away, and they do not want to be put in danger of an FTB child rate reduction.

Based on these facts, this would not constitute special circumstances. Even if Cecelia cannot get Henny's health checked during the 2023-24 income year, Cecelia still has up until when Henny turns 5 to get the health check completed and to notify Centrelink. Cecelia has an obligation to ensure the health check is completed for Henny or Henny's FTB child rate may be reduced for each day during an FTB child rate reduction period.

Death of an individual or FTB child

For income years prior to 2018-19, if an individual dies either during the income year in which their child turns 4, or within the subsequent year after the year in which the child turned 4, an exemption will apply.

For income years from 2018-19, if the child dies during the income year in which they turn 4 or before their fifth birthday or any later days determined by Centrelink, an exemption will apply. If the child dies during an FTB child rate reduction period for the child, the rate reduction will no longer apply in relation to that child.

Example:

Joshua receives FTB for their daughter Gertrude who turns 4 in the 2022-23 income year. Joshua dies in the 2023-24 income year. Special circumstances will apply as Joshua dies within the first 12 months that Gertrude turned 4.

Example:

Jade receives FTB for her son Bobby who turns 4 in the 2023-24 income year. Bobby dies prior to his fifth birthday, which means special circumstances will apply.

However, as the special circumstances exemption applies to the individual, the health check requirement will still apply in relation to the child following a change of care that occurs within the income year the child turns 4, if the new carer meets the criteria to be subject to the health check requirement.

3.1.5.90 Maintenance action test reviews

Summary

This topic explains what review action should be taken under Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the

CSS

to ensure that an individual is taking reasonable maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) action.

If the individual has been granted an exemption or a period of review and the reason is no longer appropriate or applicable because circumstances have changed, the exemption must be reviewed. If appropriate, they must be advised that they are required to take reasonable action for maintenance. If the individual does not take steps to meet this requirement within 14 days, their FTB Part A must be reduced to the base rate (

1.1.B.10

) for the affected child or children.

General review timeframes

Where an individual has maintenance action in progress under Stage 1 or Stage 2, their circumstances should be reviewed at least every 12 months. It may be appropriate to review the case sooner depending on the circumstances.

Example:

A court has refused to make an order regarding the paternity of the payer (

1.1.P.72

). The recipient indicates that she will be pursuing the matter further and has applied to Legal Aid for assistance. Her circumstances should be reviewed once the outcome of her application to Legal Aid is known.

This is explained further in this topic.

Violence or fear of violence

12 months, unless a more appropriate time is specified by a social worker (

3.1.5.70

).

Other circumstances

As applicable

Payer's income is too low

Where a Stage 1 individual cannot complete action because the payer's income is too low, this should be checked every 12 months to determine if Centrelink records show the payer is receiving a pension, allowance or benefit. If the payer is receiving a social security payment (

1.1.S.80

), the payee can be considered to have maintenance action in progress.

To ensure that the confidentiality provisions in Division 3 of Part 5 of the

SS(Admin)Act

are not breached, the individual must not be told that the payer receives a social security payment.

If Centrelink records show that the payer is no longer receiving a social security payment, the individual should be advised that:

maintenance action must be taken, or

they must provide evidence that the payer's income is still so low that payment of child support could not be expected.

If the individual cannot provide such evidence, the individual must take action to obtain a court order or a child support assessment/agreement.

The payer will still be required to pay a minimum amount per year (CS Guide

2.3.2

), even if they receive a social security payment, if Child Support is collecting child support under:

a Stage 2 child support administrative assessment, or

a court order or court registered agreement.

From 1 July 2008, if a payer reports a low taxable income and is not receiving income support, they may be required to pay child support based on a fixed assessment. Fixed assessments cover parents who minimise their taxable income in a way that does not fairly represent their true income or real capacity to pay child support.

If the individual receives income support and has regular care of a child (between 14% and less than 35% or between 52 nights and 127 nights a year), they do not need to pay the minimum as they already meet some of the costs of raising the child directly through the care they provide.

If an individual receives income support and has 2 or more child support assessments they will pay an amount of child support, which is divided equally between the payees. Current child support rates can be found in the CS Guide

2.3.2

.

Proof of paternity

Where a court has refused to make an order as to paternity or paternity testing (and this is evidenced by a court document/s or legal advice), the exemption should be continued. These cases should be reviewed as necessary. When the case is reviewed, a social worker should interview the individual to determine whether the circumstances have altered. If the situation is likely to continue for a temporary period, the exemption may be continued for a period of up to 6 months. If the situation is likely to continue indefinitely, a permanent exemption may be granted.

1.1.D.90 Disallowable legislative instrument

Definition

A disallowable legislative instrument is a determination made by the Minister or the Secretary containing guidelines that must be taken into account in making decisions.

A disallowable legislative instrument must be notified in the Gazette and must be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of the making of the instrument. The instrument will come into effect if:

no motion of disallowance has been moved within 15 sitting days in either house, or

such a motion has been withdrawn or defeated.

2.6.6.20 CCS - individual only eligible for session of care for nominated child

Summary

For an individual (

1.1.I.90

) to claim (

1.1.C.27

)

CCS

or

ACCS

for sessions of care delivered by an

IHC

approved child care service (

1.1.A.90

), a child in respect to whom the individual is eligible must be nominated for each session of care (

1.1.S.40

). The nominated child may be any of the children in the session of care in respect to whom the individual meets the eligibility criteria for CCS or ACCS. The family has the option to nominate the child for each session of care and advise the IHC approved child care service accordingly.

As CCS and ACCS for sessions of care delivered by IHC approved child care services is a family rate, all children in a session of care must be recorded in the session of care with the full fee against the nominated child and $0 against any remaining children.

For the years prior to the 2021-22 financial year, there was an annual subsidy cap of $10,560* per year per child for families with an annual

ATI

(

1.1.A.20

) of more than $189,390* and up to $353,680*. ACCS was not included in the calculation of the annual subsidy cap. The annual cap was removed in the 2021-22 financial year.

For these previous financial years, where there were multiple children being supported by the family rate of CCS for IHC and the nominated child reached the annual cap, the family and the IHC approved child care service could amend the enrolment (

1.1.E.25

) to change the nominated child for future sessions of care.

*These amounts are correct for 2020-21.

2.1.1.70 Disputed care arrangements

Note

Where an individual receives

FTB

for a child and the same child is recognised in a child support assessment, a care determination made by the Secretary (responsible for FTB decisions) is also recognised in the individual's child support assessment. Similarly, if a care determination is made by the Child Support Registrar (responsible for child support decisions) in relation to the same individual and child, it will also be used to assess the individual's eligibility for, and rate of, FTB (

2.1.1.50

).

Summary

This topic describes how the law applies following enactment of the

Social Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support and Family Assistance Technical Amendments) Act 2024

(the Technical Amendments Act), which impacts disputed care changes where the:

care determination for the care change is to be or has been made on or after 29 March 2024, and

relevant change of care day is also on or after 29 March 2024.

This topic includes details about:

what is a disputed care arrangement

situations where FTB can be paid during an interim period

taking reasonable action to ensure compliance with a care arrangement

length of interim period

taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution

changes in care where an interim period applied

special circumstances where an interim period does not apply

situations where there is no care arrangement

review during the interim period for individuals who receive FTB instalment, and

validation of past interim period determinations.

What is a disputed care arrangement?

For the purposes of FTB, a dispute in relation to the care of a child exists where a care arrangement for the child applies and there is a departure from the terms of the arrangement by one of the parties and the other party wishes to have the arrangement complied with. A care arrangement for a child is a written agreement between the parents, or between a parent and a carer relating to the care of the child, or a parenting plan or a court order for the child (

1.1.C.05

).

The dispute may relate to a departure from shared care arrangements between 2 or more individuals, or to a departure from arrangements for the sole care of a child, where care changes from one individual to another in contravention of the arrangement.

Disputed care is different from situations where there is disagreement between individuals over the facts regarding the care of a child, whether or not a care arrangement is in place for the child.

Explanation:

Where separated parents, for example, disagree over how much care is actually being provided for the child by each parent in a shared care situation, the care arrangements need to be verified. This is dealt with in

2.1.1.30

.

Disputed care is also different from abduction of a child, or where the child is missing or has left home without consent, which is in

2.1.1.90

.

Situations where FTB can be paid during an interim period

Where the care of a child is shared and the actual care corresponds with that in a care arrangement, each individual's percentage of care can be determined based on the care arrangement. If the actual care is different from the percentage of care determined on the basis of the care arrangement then, in normal circumstances, actual care must be used to determine each individual's percentage of care.

However, if an individual's FTB child is prevented from being in their care in accordance with a care arrangement without their consent and they take reasonable steps to have the care arrangement complied with, then there may be an interim period where care is determined by the care arrangement rather than actual care. If an interim care determination is made, Centrelink will determine 2 percentages of care for each party. The first percentage is the amount of care the person should have of the child under the care arrangement. The second percentage is the amount of care the person actually has of the child. The first percentage of care will apply during the interim period, which means FTB (and child support, if relevant) will continue to be assessed in accordance with the care arrangement for the interim period. The length of the interim period will depend on a number of factors. The second percentage of care will apply after the interim period has ended.

There are a range of situations where an individual may continue to be eligible for FTB during an interim period such as situations where contact has been prevented by one party, or where a child has not been returned after a contact visit, or where the child chooses to live with the other carer.

The intention is to allow for a person's rate of FTB to be maintained for the duration of the interim period to the parent or carer who has reduced care, despite the fact that the parent or carer does not have actual care (

1.1.C.90

) of the child in the way the care arrangement anticipates.

An interim period may apply where it is the first care percentage determination for a new FTB claim. An interim period may also apply where there is a subsequent care percentage determination after a care change and the care change occurs on or after 29 March 2024.

Example:

Jim and Keith have a court order made on 2 May 2021 providing them with 50% care each of their child, Fran, which they had been following since the start of the order. On 15 September 2023, when lodging a claim for FTB for Fran, Jim advises Centrelink that Fran has been living with him full time from 1 August 2023. When Centrelink contacts Keith, he advises that he disputes the care change and is negotiating directly with Jim to resume the court-ordered care. Centrelink makes a decision to apply an interim period from 15 September 2023 and recognises 50% care each for Jim and Keith for the interim period. The interim period may last up to 26 weeks from 1 August 2023, depending on whether Jim takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.

Example:

Bill and Haley have a court order, made on 1 September 2018, providing them with 50% care each of their child, Lauren. Bill and Haley have both received FTB for Lauren since 15 February 2019. Bill and Haley have been following the care percentages provided for in the court order. On 20 September 2024, Haley refuses to return Lauren to Bill's care and contacts Centrelink to advise that she will now have 100% care of Lauren. When Centrelink contacts Bill, he advises that he agrees care has changed as described by Haley, but disputes the change in care and is seeking legal advice about his options. As Bill is disputing the change in care and taking reasonable steps to have the care arrangement complied with, Centrelink makes an interim determination and both parties continue receiving FTB as previously assessed prior to the change in care. The interim period may last up to 26 weeks from 20 September 2024, depending on whether Haley takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.

Note:

An interim determination cannot be made where the claim for FTB is made after the end of the maximum interim period for the care percentage determination (FAAct section 35F(1)(a)).

Note:

An interim period cannot be made in relation to an individual if a previous care determination made by the Secretary (or the Registrar for child support purposes) in relation to the individual has been revoked and the change in care occurred prior to 29 March 2024.

Note:

An interim period does not apply in cases where the child is taken by state or territory welfare authorities, as removal by the state under relevant child protection legislation has legal authority. For FTB purposes, a care arrangement for a child ceases to apply when the child has been removed by state or territory child welfare authorities.

Taking reasonable action to ensure compliance with care arrangement

The person with reduced care must continue to take reasonable action to ensure compliance with the care arrangement in order to have their FTB continue to be based on the care arrangement for the interim period. Reasonable action could include:

negotiating with the other party in a genuine attempt to ensure compliance with a written agreement

making themselves available in a genuine attempt to take up care of their child as provided for in the care arrangement

making and/or attending an appointment at a Family Relationships Centre (FRC) or similar dispute resolution service with the aim of ensuring the care arrangement is adhered to

obtaining or seeking legal advice regarding the making of a court order

filing an application to a Court to have an order made or enforced

attending a hearing at Court to seek an order to be made or enforced, or

notifying the police that the child has been taken without consent.

Individuals who receive either a past period or instalment payment must provide evidence that reasonable action has been taken to ensure compliance with the care arrangement. Acceptable evidence includes:

a written account of the steps an individual has taken to negotiate with the other parent, verified by Centrelink with the other parent and/or an independent third party, such as a legal representative

documentation from an FRC or dispute resolution service setting out the details of an upcoming appointment and the action sought, or

documentation of police or court action.

Where possible, a copy of the documentation should be attached to the individual's request. Otherwise Centrelink must sight the evidence and document the details with the individual's request.

The individual must take reasonable action to ensure compliance with the existing care arrangement. Where an individual simply complains about the loss of care to Centrelink, this does not meet the requirement of taking reasonable action.

Example:

Julie and Rob have legal responsibility for their child Zoe and have a care agreement in place. Julie is refusing to return the child into Rob's care as per the agreement due to concerns for the child's safety. Julie has filed a police report and the allegations are currently being investigated. Rob's lawyer has recommended in a letter that Rob should not attempt to have the care agreement enforced until the investigation is completed. This would be seen as taking reasonable action to have the current care agreement enforced and actual care would not apply. If the investigation is completed within the interim period and allegations against Rob are unfounded, and Rob does not subsequently seek to have the care agreement enforced, this would be deemed as not taking reasonable action and the Secretary may review the interim period.

Example:

James and Sarah have legal responsibility for their child Jack and have a care agreement in place. James is refusing to return the child into Sarah's care as per the agreement due to concerns for the child's safety. The allegations are currently being investigated and Sarah is cooperating with Police and State Community Services requests. Sarah seeks advice from a lawyer regarding enforcing the care agreement. The lawyer advises Sarah of the legal cost to enforce this agreement. Sarah is currently not working, and cannot afford to pay the legal costs quoted. Sarah contacts Centrelink to inform them of this outcome. As Sarah would continue action if the cost was not prohibitive, this would be seen to be taking reasonable action, as it is not within her financial means to continue and she is cooperating with all aspects of the investigation.

Note:

Where a parent with reduced care has not taken reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with, and their percentage of care has been determined according to the actual care they have of the child (that is, an interim determination was not made), and the parent subsequently takes reasonable action for the care arrangement to be complied with, an interim period will not apply.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 35C Percentage of care if action taken to ensure that a care arrangement …, section 35P Determination must be revoked if …

Length of interim period

The interim period begins on the first day that the actual care of the child ceased to correspond with the care provided for under the care arrangement. The length of the interim period depends on a number of factors, including:

whether the care arrangement is specified under a court order, parenting plan or written agreement

when the care arrangement was made

when the disputed care change occurred

whether the person with reduced care ceases to take reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with, and

whether the person with increased care is taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.

The maximum interim period will apply in situations where the person with increased care does not take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution at any time during that period. If the person with reduced care ceases to take reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with, the interim period will end on the day they cease to take such action.

Court orders

For court orders, the maximum interim period that can apply is the later of:

52 weeks from the day the care arrangement provided by the court order takes effect, or

26 weeks from the change of care day.

A shorter interim period may apply if the change of care occurs after the first 26 weeks from the day the court order takes effect and the person with increased care takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. The shorter interim period will end at the earlier of:

14 weeks from the day the person with increased care started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (but no earlier than 52 weeks starting from the day the court order took effect), or

26 weeks from the change of care day.

Parenting plans & written agreements

For parenting plans and written agreements, the maximum interim period that can apply is 14 weeks from the change of care day.

A shorter interim period may apply if the change of care occurs after the first 38 weeks from the day the parenting plan or written agreement takes effect, and the person with increased care takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. The shorter interim period will end at the earlier of:

4 weeks from the day the person with increased care started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (but no earlier than 52 weeks starting from the day the parenting plan or written agreement took effect), or

14 weeks from the change of care day.

At the end of the interim period, the care percentage will be based on actual care from the day after the end of the interim period.

Later interim periods

If a shorter interim period has ended, and the person with increased care ceases to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution before the maximum interim period has ended, a later interim period may apply. The person with reduced care must still be taking reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with in order for the later interim period to apply. The later interim period will start on the day the person with increased care ceased to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution, and will end according to the same rules that apply for shorter interim periods.

If a later interim period applies, and the person with increased care begins to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution again, the later interim period may end earlier, according to the same rules that apply for shorter interim periods.

In some situations, an interim period may end early and no later interim period can apply in relation to the same care arrangement. For example, if the person with reduced care ceases to take reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with, or the care arrangement itself ceases to apply (for example, it has an 'end date'), the interim period will end on the day those events occur. Other examples include where:

a new care arrangement begins to apply, or

special circumstances exist in relation to the child (where those special circumstances were not present at the time the interim determination was made).

In these circumstances, the interim period will end the day before any of the above events occur

.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 3(1)-'change of care day', section 3(1)-'maximum interim period', section 35FA Meaning of interim period

Taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution

The person with increased care must take continuous reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution in order for a shorter interim period to apply, or to avoid a later interim period applying. Reasonable action means initiating or participating in family dispute resolution with an accredited family dispute resolution practitioner within a reasonable period of the change of care day. If the action did not occur within a reasonable period of the change of care day, Centrelink may determine that reasonable action started on a later date.

It is up to Centrelink to determine what is considered a 'reasonable period' in which the reasonable action started, and it will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. If the person with increased care does not take reasonable action within a reasonable period, the end of the interim period will be the end of 14 weeks starting on the day the person began taking reasonable action, rather than the change of care day.

Example:

Joan and Kim have a court order made on 2 May 2015, providing them with 50% care each of their son, Fred. On 30 July 2024, Joan advises Centrelink that Fred has decided to live with her full time. When Centrelink contacts Kim, she advises that she disputes the care change and is negotiating directly with Joan to resume the court-ordered care. Kim also advises that Joan has been refusing her requests to attend family dispute resolution to resolve the issue, which Centrelink confirms with Joan. Centrelink makes a decision to apply an interim period from 30 July 2024. Because Joan is not taking reasonable action to attend family dispute resolution, the interim period will end on 27 January 2025 (26 weeks from the change of care day).

On 14 September 2024, Joan contacts Centrelink to advise that she decided to attend a family dispute resolution session arranged by Kim on the same day. Because Joan has started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution, the interim period will end earlier, on 20 December 2024, 14 weeks starting on the day Joan began to take reasonable action.

If the reasonable action ceases within the maximum interim period (that is, the person with increased care fails to attend a family dispute resolution session), then it is not considered continuous reasonable action. The effect of ceasing reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution will depend on when the reasonable action ceased. If the reasonable action ceased while a shorter interim period applied, the interim period will be extended to the maximum interim period. If the reasonable action ceased after a shorter interim period has ended but before the end of the maximum interim period, a later interim period will apply.

If the person with increased care starts to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution again (that is, they failed to attend an earlier session, but do attend a subsequent session), then the interim period may end earlier, subject to the rules outlined above.

Centrelink may seek evidence that reasonable action has been taken, has ceased, or has re-started. This may include verification by the other party, documentation from a family dispute resolution practitioner, or a certificate issued under section 60I of the

Family Law Act 1975

.

Changes in care where an interim period applied

Where a shorter interim period has ended, the care percentages are determined according to the actual care that is occurring. If there is a subsequent change to the actual care of the child before the end of the maximum interim period, the new actual care percentages may be reflected. Centrelink may suspend the earlier determination of actual care that was made, and the new actual care percentages will take effect from the day Centrelink is notified or otherwise becomes aware of the change in care. If the change in actual care occurred before the end of a shorter or later interim period, the new actual care percentages will be reflected from the day after the shorter or later interim period ends. If there are further changes to the actual care before the end of the maximum interim period, the date of effect of those changes are subject to the rules outlined in FAAct section 35P.

If a later interim period applies, Centrelink must revoke the suspension of the earlier actual care determination and the subsequent actual care determination. The revocation takes effect at the end of the day before the person with increased care ceased to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.

After the maximum interim period has ended, Centrelink must revoke the actual care determination (that is, the second percentage of care that corresponded with the actual care of the child) and make a new care determination.

However, if Centrelink made a subsequent actual care determination that applied after the shorter interim period ended, the subsequent actual care determination will continue to apply after the maximum interim period has ended, until a change in care occurs. See

2.1.1.20

for information about care determinations and changes in care that apply outside of the interim period provisions.

Shared care & change of care summary

Special circumstances where an interim period does not apply

In order to apply an interim period, Centrelink must be satisfied that there are no special circumstances that led to the change in care. An interim period will not apply if Centrelink are satisfied there are special circumstances relating to the child that led to the change in care.

Centrelink will consider the individual circumstances that led to the change in care to determine whether the circumstances are a significant cause of the change in care. Centrelink will also consider whether there was a substantial risk to the physical, emotional or psychological well-being of the child if the care arrangement had continued to be followed.

The special circumstances could relate to the child directly or to another individual, such as the person with increased care, to the extent that those circumstances relate to the child.

Special circumstances include, but are not limited to, situations where violence or other inappropriate behaviour by the person who has reduced care has contributed to the change in care.

Examples of unreasonable and unusual behaviour of the parent include:

violence towards the child or the person with increased care

exposing the child to family violence (within the meaning of section 4AB of the Family Law Act)

directly involving the child in a criminal act

exposing the child to alcohol, drugs or substance abuse

involving the child in criminal, sexual or unhealthy activities

substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirements, and/or

neglecting the child's basic needs, such as withholding essential medical care from the child or disregarding their daily needs for food, shelter, hygiene etc.

The decision should take into account any information provided by the parent with less care as well as information from the person who gained care. Decisions should be made on the basis of evidence that supports relevant findings of fact, particularly in situations where the facts are disputed. Acceptable evidence from an independent third party will vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Where a parent has been violent towards their child, the absence of a child welfare order would not prevent the discretion being exercised. Allegations of abuse that are not supported by other evidence would not normally result in the discretion being exercised.

Suitable evidence may include (but is not limited to):

police reports

intervention order preventing contact with the child or person with increased care

verification with the Department of Community Services and/or the police, or

statements from a medical or other relevant professional regarding assault or abuse of the child or person with increased care.

Example:

Brian and Grace have a court order which states that they will have equal shared care of their daughter, Ashlyn. Grace asks Centrelink to make a new care determination on the basis that she now has 100% care of Ashlyn.

Grace states she is denying care of Ashlyn to Brian after Ashlyn was returned from Brian's house with severe bruises and soreness. Ashlyn said her father had been physically violent towards her and the GP who treated him provided a statement that the injuries were consistent with the explanation provided by Ashlyn.

Brian has initiated proceedings in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia for a Recovery Order for Ashlyn.

Given the special circumstances, Centrelink decides that an interim period does not apply and amends the assessment using care percentages based on the care that is actually occurring despite Brian taking reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with.

Special circumstances are not limited to the inappropriate or unreasonable actions of a parent. This means an interim period may not apply for reasons of special circumstances even where all parties have acted reasonably. Centrelink must be satisfied that the special circumstances relate in some way to the child. For example, a care arrangement may be unable to be complied with due to the illness, injury or actions of the child or another person to the extent that the circumstances relate to the child (such as where that person is unable to provide care for the child). If Centrelink is satisfied that there are special circumstances that relate to the child in such a situation then an interim period will not apply because the reason the person is not able to have care of their child has not resulted from the child being withheld from them by the other parent or carer.

Example:

Ben and Violet have a court order which states that they will have equal shared care of their son, Rocco, who is 17. Ben asks the Registrar to make a new care determination on the basis that Violet no longer has any care of Rocco.

Ben states he is not denying care of Rocco to Violet, but Rocco is adamant he does not want to return to Violet’s house. Ben has been trying to facilitate care of Rocco for Violet in accordance with the court order, and has packed his bag every week, and is ready and waiting to drive Rocco to Violet’s house at the normal drop off time each week. Ben does not drop Rocco at Violet’s house, as Rocco will not get in the car. No conflicting activities are arranged by Ben for Rocco.

Violet regularly reminds Ben that she expects him to comply with the orders, and is ready and waiting at home to receive Rocco at the usual drop off time.

Violet books a family counselling session at Relationships Australia with the objective that a discussion with a mediator may help Rocco agree to go back to 50/50 care. The earliest available session is in 2 months. Ben agrees to attend, however Rocco refuses to attend.

Given the special circumstances, Centrelink decides that an interim period does not apply and amends the assessment using care percentages based on the care that is actually occurring, despite Violet taking reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with.

Note:

Long-term decisions about the child's care arrangements should be determined under family law where relevant parties are unable to come to an arrangement.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 23 Effect of FTB child ceasing to be in individuals care without consent, section 35C Percentage of care if action taken to ensure that a care arrangement …

Situations where there is no care arrangement

Where there is no care arrangement in place for the care of the child, an interim period will not apply. A care arrangement does not exist where parents have only a verbal agreement for the care of a child.

In cases where individuals are in dispute about care and they do not have a care arrangement in place, the care in the assessment will be based on the actual level of care each parent is providing.

Example:

When Karen and Tony separated, they entered into a verbal agreement for the care of their children. Under the agreement, Karen had care of their children. On one particular occasion, the children visit Tony, and he decides not to return the children to Karen as he wishes to retain care. Tony lodges a claim for FTB for the children. Karen does not consent to the change of care. Karen applies for a hearing at the Family Law Court to get sole legal responsibility for the children and have them returned to her care. Karen loses eligibility for FTB as soon as the children leave her care. She does not meet the requirements to have her eligibility extended because a verbal agreement does not constitute a care arrangement. Tony has retained joint legal responsibility for the children, they are in his care, and he meets the eligibility requirements for FTB.

Similarly, if a non-parent carer was caring for a child on the basis of a verbal understanding with the child's parent, an interim period would not apply if the child returned to live with their parent against the wishes of the non-parent carer.

Example:

Grace is Kelly's grandmother. Grace claimed FTB for Kelly because the child's parent was unable to care for her properly. There is no care arrangement relating to Grace's care of Kelly. Several months later, Kelly's parent decides to take Kelly back into her care and reclaims FTB for her. Grace wants to retain care and disputes that Kelly's parent should get FTB for her. Neither of them wants to share the care of Kelly. Grace applies for a review of the decision to cancel her FTB for Kelly. Grace cannot have her eligibility for FTB extended, as she does not have a care arrangement in place for the care of the child. Kelly's parent is eligible for FTB as she is caring for the child and meets all the eligibility and claim requirements.

Act reference:

FAAct

section 22 When an individual is an FTB child of another individual

Review during the interim period for individuals who receive FTB instalment

If payment is being made to an individual during the interim period, entitlement may be reviewed within the interim period, if considered appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

If the individual is no longer taking reasonable action, or an outcome has been reached, the interim period ceases immediately and entitlement to FTB must be reassessed to reflect the circumstances at the time.

Validation of past interim period determinations

The Technical Amendments Act provides that the legal validity of an interim care decision made between 23 May 2018 and 28 March 2024 inclusive is unimpacted by an earlier determination being revoked under FAAct section 35P or section 35Q (notwithstanding paragraph 35F(1)(c), which was in force during that period).

6.4.3.10 Valid reasons for not lodging a tax return

Summary

This topic outlines the reasons why an individual and/or their partner may not be required to lodge a tax return for the relevant income year (

1.1.R.23

).

Valid reasons for not lodging a tax return

The criteria outlined by the

ATO

at the beginning of each tax year for determining whether an individual is required to lodge a tax return for that year are used to determine whether or not an individual and/or their partner has a valid reason for not lodging a return.

Generally, an individual should lodge a tax return if they have assessable taxable income.

You can find more information about income thresholds and other income tax information on the

ATO website

.

Not required to lodge an income tax return - requirement to notify

ATI

An individual who claims or receives

FTB

(and their partner, if they have one) is required to notify Centrelink of their ATI within 12 months from the end of the relevant income year (

1.1.I.75

) if they are not required to lodge an income tax return.

If the individual is not a member of a couple and notifies Centrelink of their ATI because they are not required to lodge an income tax return for an income year, their payments for that income year will be reconciled.

If the individual is a member of a couple and notifies Centrelink of their combined ATI because both they and their partner are not required to lodge an income tax return for an income year, the payments for that income year will be reconciled.

If only one member of a couple is required to lodge an income tax return, the payments for that income year will be reconciled after the required party lodges their income tax return and the individual who receives FTB notifies Centrelink of the ATI of the party who is not required to lodge.

ATI notification must be reasonable

Centrelink must be satisfied that the individual’s ATI notification is reasonable, taking into account the reason for the notification, the nature of the income components being declared and the individual's (and/or their partner's) income circumstances for past income years.

Possible reasons for an individual's notification to be considered unreasonable could be evidence of:

income higher than the tax free threshold

the individual being a child support payer/payee, or

income components for which the individual would need to lodge a tax return to obtain the benefit of (for example, net financial investment losses).

The individual may be asked to obtain evidence from the ATO that they are not required to lodge.

Example:

If the individual has for several years had a yearly income above the tax free threshold and there is some evidence this has not changed, Centrelink may decide not to accept their notification and refer the individual to the ATO for assessment.

The actual income used by Centrelink must be accepted by the individual.

Explanation:

Centrelink staff may assist the individual in working out their ATI for the relevant income year, however the individual is legally responsible for notifying Centrelink of their ATI amount and therefore must be satisfied with the figures they provide.

If Centrelink considers that the ATI provided by the individual is not reasonable, it may decide not to accept the notification. If so, in order for the individual's entitlement to be reconciled, they will have to either:

lodge a tax return

complete a non-lodger advice form with the ATO, or

provide a revised notification of their ATI.

If the individual does not do any of the above, they will be subject to the non-lodger process.

Introduction

The notification period is the period of time that an individual has in which to notify Centrelink of a change in their circumstances and still be considered to have notified in time.

Child care subsidy

For the purposes of

CCS

or

ACCS

, an individual receiving CCS or ACCS must notify Centrelink as soon as practicable of any event that affects their eligibility to receive CCS or ACCS or the level of their entitlement (

1.1.E.30

).

Family tax benefit

Where an individual is receiving

FTB

via instalment (

1.1.I.100

) payments, they must notify Centrelink as soon as is practicable of any event that will reduce their entitlement or result in them being no longer eligible for the payment. However individuals who do not notify of the event will have their FTB payments reconciled at the end of the financial year and will have to pay back any amounts they should not have received.

Where an individual is receiving FTB via instalment payments and an event occurs that results in an increase in rate, the individual's FTB can usually be adjusted back to the beginning of the income year prior to the Secretary finding out about the change.

3.1.5.70 Exemptions from the maintenance action test

General exemptions

Individuals may be granted a full or partial exemption from the maintenance (

1.1.M.10

) action test in the following circumstances:

if they fear that taking action to seek child support (

1.1.C.20

) will cause the payer (

1.1.P.72

) to react violently towards them or their family (

1.1.F.15

)

where seeking child support may have a harmful or disruptive effect on them or the payer

if the identity of the other parent of the child or children is unknown

if they have had legal advice that parentage could not be proven through a court

if they have been unsuccessful in proving parentage (such as failed attempts to locate a child's other parent)

where the child was born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement which is not recognised under the

Family Law Act 1975

if there are cultural considerations that adversely impact on the individual's capacity to take reasonable maintenance action

where the payer in the child support case is deceased, or

where there are other exceptional circumstances.

These are explained further in this topic. The topic also includes reasons an exemption from maintenance action should not be granted.

It may be inappropriate for an individual to take maintenance action where:

there have been documented incidents of violence towards the individual and/or their immediate family by the payer, or

violence by the payer may occur if the individual takes maintenance action.

Note:

This would also include instances where parentage has not been established and there is a threat of violence from the potential payer.

Trauma associated with proving parentage

A social worker may consider that it would be emotionally traumatic for an individual to take action to establish proof of parentage in cases where the parent has not:

put their name on the birth certificate, or

acknowledged that they are the parent of the child.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.100

Role of the ISO & social worker

The other parent is unknown

If the individual states that the other parent of the child is unknown, a full copy of the birth certificate or adoption papers and the

FTB

claim should be sighted before the case is assessed by a service officer with appropriate delegation. The case may be referred to a social worker if it is an unusual or complex case, or if the individual requests to speak with a social worker. Where an individual seeks a 'parentage unknown' exemption for a second or subsequent child the matter will be referred to a social worker.

If there is another parent listed on the birth certificate that the individual states is not the biological parent, the individual needs to verify this information. The Secretary or delegate needs to be satisfied that parentage is not established by the evidence. Evidence of parentage could be provided through a court ruling, a DNA test, or a separate statutory declaration from each party. Legal Aid, or other legal entities, may be able to assist the individual with undergoing DNA testing or seeking other evidence to establish parentage.

If the individual knows who the other parent is and the grounds for presumption of parentage are not met, the individual must take legal action to establish parentage.

If an individual claims not to know who the other parent of the child is, it may be because they are afraid of violence or have other good grounds for an exemption from taking maintenance action. In these circumstances, the individual must be referred to a social worker. If the social worker or service officer with appropriate delegation is satisfied that the individual does not know the identity of the other parent, an exemption may be given.

Note:

It is not intended that a letter from Legal Aid in itself would be an evidentiary method.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.6.10

Proof of parentage

Unsuccessfully tried to prove parentage

An individual is exempt where:

a court has said the potential payer is not the parent

Legal Aid will not fund the parentage case (including when Legal Aid is unable to assist the individual due to remoteness), or

the potential payer's whereabouts remain unknown and the payee has taken reasonable steps to locate the payer.

If the individual does not provide proof that one of the above circumstances applies and the individual is reluctant to take legal action, they should then be referred to a social worker. If a social worker considers that it would be very emotionally traumatic for the individual, to take court action and the situation is likely to be of a temporary nature, then the social worker may grant a temporary exemption and implement a shorter review period.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.90

Maintenance action test reviews

Surrogacy cases

An exemption should be granted where a child is born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement which is not recognised under the Family Law Act.

Section 60HB of the Family Law Act states that if a court has made an order under a prescribed law of a state or territory to the effect that:

a child is the child of one or more persons, or

each of one or more persons is a parent of a child

then, for the purposes of that Act, the child is the child of each of those persons.

For the purposes of the

MAT

, the parent/s of the child are those people listed in the court order as the parent/s of the child. In circumstances where these parents separate they are not exempt from the MAT on the basis that there was a surrogacy arrangement involved in their case. However, other exemptions may apply.

Where there is no court order as described above, the surrogacy arrangement is not recognised under the Family Law Act. In these cases, the individual is exempt from the MAT because it would be unreasonable for them to seek maintenance from the birth parent who had the child on behalf of the individual and their partner (if any).

If an individual had a partner at the time they first claimed FTB for a child born under a surrogacy arrangement and the individual's relationship with the partner ends, the individual is not required to seek maintenance from the partner. This is because, under child support legislation, maintenance can only be sought from a legal parent of the child and neither the individual nor their former partner is the child's legal parent.

Act reference:

Family Law Act 1975

section 60HB Children born under surrogacy arrangements

Cultural considerations

Particular care should be given to an individual's cultural background. There are also wide differences in attitudes to marriage, gender roles and parenting among different ethnic groups, and these factors should be taken into account as they affect individual cases. An assessment of cultural considerations may indicate that maintenance action would not be successful and might cause hardship to the individual and/or their community.

If the social worker considers that pursuing child support would be unsuccessful or cause hardship to the individual and/or their community, an exemption may be granted.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.100

Role of the ISO & social worker

Cultural considerations - Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Australians

In some situations individuals may refuse or be reluctant to take action to receive child support because of their cultural beliefs. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australians should be referred to a social worker who will consult with an

ISO

for a recommendation about an exemption. A social worker should consult with an ISO to seek advice on cultural beliefs and other considerations in order to make an informed decision. Situations where it may be culturally inappropriate for the individual to take child support action include:

where the child is born as a result of a culturally prohibited relationship

where extended family responsibilities require the family to share in the care of the child and maintenance action would cause undue disruption to these arrangements, and

where action to obtain child support might cause hardship to the individual and/or the community.

Example:

It would be inappropriate for an individual to take maintenance action when they are living in a small remote community and requiring them to take such action would result in them being ostracised by the community. The recommendation to the delegate should outline the full impact and ramifications of taking action for the individual and the community.

Exemptions for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australians on the basis of fear of violence or the identity of the other parent is unknown should still be referred to the social worker as the social worker still has primary responsibility for these cases. However, it is recognised that the ISO can provide valuable assistance to both the individual and the social worker in obtaining the necessary information to help decide these cases. The assessment of these cases may be undertaken jointly by the ISO and the social worker. In these cases it is appropriate for a joint interview involving both the ISO and the social worker.

Role of the ISO & social worker,

Member of a couple

Payer is deceased - ending a child support case

From the date that the payer in a child support case is deceased, individuals should receive a full exemption from the MAT for any relevant children as it is no longer reasonable for the individual to take maintenance action. If the individual is privately collecting child support and is owed arrears from the deceased payer they should receive a partial exemption for the arrears owed.

Other exceptional circumstances

There may be other situations where the social worker considers that it is inappropriate for the individual to take maintenance action. If the social worker considers that the individual should be exempt due to exceptional circumstances, policy advice should be sought from the local policy unit. These circumstances could relate to a range of different situations experienced by individuals, including threats from the payer, or in certain circumstances, a lack of cooperation from the payer that prevents the individual from taking maintenance action.

Example:

It may be appropriate to grant an exemption in circumstances where:

the payer has threatened violence against other people connected with the individual including friends and relatives not of their immediate family

the payer will not agree to an extension of a child support agreement past the child's 18th birthday, where the child is still in full-time secondary study.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

3.1.5.40

Maintenance action in progress,

3.1.5.60

When maintenance action is not applicable

Partial exemptions from the MAT - private collect cases

A partial exemption may be granted in cases where an individual is collecting child support privately and:

has a fear of violence

there is risk of harmful or disruptive effects

there are cultural considerations to take into account, or

there are other exceptional circumstances that make it unreasonable for them to pursue the collection of their full entitlement or to transfer collection method to Child Support.

Individuals in this situation will be referred to a social worker for assessment who may grant a partial exemption.

The partial exemption enables the individual to collect whatever they can privately without the full deemed amount being applied. This may also apply to any outstanding arrears that the individual elects not to collect.

In these circumstances, the individual's rate of FTB Part A will be based on the actual amount of child support received, not the amount of the child support assessment. If, at a later date, the individual collects the non-paid child support assessment amount, the amount received should be included in the maintenance income test (MIT) in the year it is actually received.

Where an individual is owed arrears by a payer who is now deceased, any arrears received are not treated as maintenance (

3.1.7.12

) for the purpose of the MIT. A partial exemption should be applied against the outstanding arrears amount. This means the individual does not need to collect the arrears.

Partial exemptions from the MAT - no child support assessment in place

A partial exemption from the MAT can be granted in circumstances where an individual does not have a child support assessment in place of any kind, but the other party is voluntarily paying child support to the individual, and there is:

a fear of violence

risk of harmful or disruptive effects

cultural considerations to take into account, or

other exceptional circumstances that make it unreasonable for the individual to formally take maintenance action.

Individuals in this situation will be referred to a social worker for assessment who may grant a partial exemption.

Where such an exemption is granted, it allows Centrelink to count any child support the individual receives under the MIT.

Example:

After separating from her partner, Trish advises Centrelink that she has 100% care of her children. Centrelink instructs her to take maintenance action, or risk failing the MAT. Trish advises that her ex-partner voluntarily pays her $250 per week by way of informal child support, but there is no child support assessment in place. Trish explains that her ex-partner has threatened her with violence if she seeks to have a formal child support assessment made, privately collected or otherwise.

The social worker decides to grant a partial exemption from that MAT for Trish. The $250 of informal child support that Trish receives is counted under the MIT. Centrelink advises Trish to indicate if her circumstances or the amount of voluntary child support she receives changes.

Backdating of exemption

In certain circumstances, backdating of an exemption in relation to an instalment or a past period claim may be undertaken by a social worker. For this to occur, the social worker will undertake a professional assessment to confirm that the circumstances warranting the granting of an exemption existed for the duration of the past period.

Example:

Raj receives FTB via instalments and separated from his partner 1 July. Centrelink records indicate he failed to take maintenance action within the 13 week grace period, therefore he failed the MAT. On 16 May of the next year, Raj took maintenance action. Shortly after he advised Centrelink that he was unable to do so beforehand because of fear of violence from his ex-partner and produces a copy of an apprehended violence order (AVO) that covers the period in question. The social worker determines that the circumstances in regards to violence existed since the date of separation to the date Raj took maintenance action and the exemption is granted retrospectively for that period.

It may also be appropriate to grant a backdated exemption along with an ongoing exemption where the social worker becomes aware of circumstances warranting it that existed over the past period and continue to apply presently.

Example:

Fiona lodges an instalment claim on 10 October, and a past period claim for the period 1 August to 9 October. Fiona applies for an exemption from maintenance action. During the assessment with the social worker she reports she separated due to domestic violence and produces substantiating evidence to support this. She indicates she fears seeking maintenance due to further violence. The social worker determines that the current circumstances in regards to violence existed at 1 August and the exemption is backdated to that date and continues from the date of the instalment claim.

While an exemption from taking maintenance action can be backdated as far back as there is supporting evidence, arrears of amounts of FTB Part A above the base rate may be limited by date of effect rules. If the review application is made on a date later than 52 weeks after the individual was given notice of the original decision (decision that the individual was only entitled to the base rate of FTB Part A) then the date that the review decision comes into effect is the later of:

the date from which full arrears are payable, OR

1 July of the income year before the income year in which the review decision is made.

Internal reviews

Review of exemption

The Centrelink officer determines the types of review required at the end of the review period. The main purpose of the review is to assess whether the individual's circumstances have changed in such a way that an exemption is no longer appropriate. The review does not necessarily have to take the form of a referral to a social worker or ISO. However, if the decision maker is unsure what form the review should take, they should discuss the matter with a social worker, ISO and/or the child support unit.

Example:

The review may consist of a telephone call to the individual to confirm that their circumstances have not changed.

When an individual is given an exemption as a result of violence, or if there is a fear of violence, their exemption will be reviewed 12 months after the date the exemption is applied. This review will be undertaken by a social worker who will contact the individual and assess if an exemption is still warranted. The social worker can determine a shorter or longer review period if there is a reason to do so. If the social worker determines that the exemption is no longer required, the individual will be advised that they are required to contact Child Support to apply for a child support assessment within 14 days.

Reasons exemption from maintenance action should not be granted

Exemptions should not be made for the following reasons:

the individual never lived with the payer, and/or

the individual does not want any involvement with the payer.

Explanation:

If either of these reasons is given, a social worker referral should be made. In many cases one or both of these reasons may be given when the underlying concern is a fear of violence or other acceptable justification for not taking action.

1.1.C.100 Care period for FTB assessments

Definition

The term 'care period' is used in relation to assessing shared care for the purposes of

FTB

.

The care period for working out the percentage of care provided by an adult:

begins on the day on which the care of a child starts to be shared between 2 or more adults, or the day on which the pattern of care (

2.1.1.45

) changes, and

ends when there is a subsequent change in care.

Explanation:

A care period of 12 months from the commencement of the care arrangements will generally be used where the care arrangements are ongoing. The same care arrangements will be assumed to apply for subsequent 12 month periods, unless otherwise advised. If there is no agreed ongoing pattern of care and the care arrangements only apply to a period shorter than 12 months, a one-off shorter care period may be determined.

Example:

Tom and Betty separate on 1 October 2010 and agree to an arrangement for shared care of their child, Jane, following their separation. Under the arrangements, agreed to in a registered parenting plan, Tom will care for Jane for 60% of the nights over the 12 month period following their separation, and Betty will care for Jane for 40% of the nights. It is expected that these arrangements will be ongoing. The care period is determined as a 12 month period from 1 October and the percentages of care are determined as 60% for Tom and 40% for Betty, in line with the agreement. After 12 months, Centrelink has received no advice of a change in the care arrangements, so the same care percentages continue to apply to Tom and Betty. Subsequently, on 12 January 2012, Betty advises of a change to the pattern of care, commencing from that month, where Betty and Tom each now have 50% ongoing care. This is confirmed with Tom. The new care determination will relate to the 12 month period from 12 January 2012.

Example:

Sally and John agreed to share the care of their child David from the date they separated for a trial period of 4 months until they agree on an ongoing pattern of care. David is in John's care for 60 of the 120 nights in this period. John's percentage of care is 50% for this care period, which means that he may be eligible for FTB, provided other eligibility and claim requirements are satisfied.

Policy reference:

FA Guide

2.1.1.25

Shared care of an FTB child

Care for a 12 month care period

If the care of a child is shared for a 12 month care period, the 35% minimum care rule is satisfied if the person cares for the FTB child for at least 128 days during the period.

Change of care arrangements

If there is a change of carer for the child, a new care period begins from the date of change.

Example:

Megan is cared for by each of her separated parents on a 50/50 basis, and each receives FTB instalments for her. On 10 November the care arrangements change and Megan's grandmother begins caring for her in addition to each of her parents. The new arrangement is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. In order to work out each person's proportion of care, a new care period begins for all carers from 10 November, based on the level of care each carer will have for 12 months from this date.

Example:

Joshua is cared for by his separated parents on a 35/65 basis between his father Mike, and his mother Stephanie respectively. Mike exercises the bulk of his care of Joshua every February to July. During the period August to January Stephanie cares for Joshua most of the time. These arrangements have been ongoing for some time and are part of the established pattern of care that results in Mike having 35% care of Joshua on a rolling 12 month basis, having originally commenced on 15 July 2010. On 15 October 2013, the care arrangements change so that Mike and Stephanie will share care of Joshua 50% each on an ongoing basis. The previous care determination ends on 14 October 2013, and the new care period begins on 15 October 2013 based on the level of care each parent will have over a 12 month period from this day. This care determination will continue until there is a new change in care. As both Mike and Stephanie are FTB individuals, their daily FTB entitlement in 2013-14 will be based on 35/65 care for 1 July to 14 October 2013 and 50/50 for 15 October 2013 to 30 June 2014.

1.1.L.20 Legal responsibility

Definition

For the purposes of

FA

, legal responsibility is the right to have and to make decisions concerning the day-to-day care, welfare and development of a child. Both parents are legally responsible for their child, except where:

they agree that one parent should have greater or sole responsibility, or

a court makes an order that changes their responsibility in a particular matter.

Example:

Mr Brown and his ex-partner Ms Black have a court order (

1.1.C.70

) that details the care arrangements of the children. The court order states that the children will have contact with their father on alternate weekends and half the school holidays as well as on Father's Day. The children are to have contact with their mother on Mother's Day. Legal responsibility for the children may be deemed to be joint as the court order does not specify otherwise.

Sole custody

When a person is granted sole custody of a child, that person has the legal responsibility for the care, welfare and development of that child, regardless of who has access or contact with the child, if the child is in the person's care.

2.8.1 ACCS (child wellbeing)

Introduction

The

ACCS

(child wellbeing) provides additional support for children who are at risk (

1.1.A.110

) of serious abuse or neglect, including children exposed to domestic violence. It also includes children who have been abused or neglected in the past and may continue to suffer harm as a result.

ACCS (child wellbeing) aims to reduce the possibility of early childhood education and care costs being a barrier to children 'at risk' from entering or remaining engaged with early childhood education and care. The subsidy is targeted at children already known to be at risk (for example, child under a protection order), as well as children and families before they reach crisis point and become subject to the state or territory mandatory reporting system.

Children receiving ACCS (child wellbeing) will get up to 100 hours of subsidised carer per fortnight, at up to 120% of the

CCS

hourly rate cap (

1.1.H.20

). Families may be able to get more subsidised hours and/or an increased subsidy rate in exceptional circumstances (

3.5.5

).

This section explains the eligibility criteria for ACCS (child wellbeing).

2.8.1.10 ACCS (child wellbeing) - eligibility
