# Court Date Feature - Added to CHECKLIST.md

## What Was Missing

The court date feature was implemented but only mentioned briefly in Task 4c as:
- "Court date: Add a form field (or fake it in formData)"

This was completely insufficient! It didn't explain:
- How to implement it
- What files to create/modify
- Australian date format requirement (dd/mm/yyyy)
- Date validation logic
- Where the field should appear
- How to test it

## What Was Added

### Task 4 - Step 4c: Complete Court Date Implementation (NEW)

Added a full 70-line section explaining:

1. **Create date-utils.ts** with Australian date parsing functions
2. **Update calculator hook** to add courtDate to form state
3. **Update calculator screen** to add handler
4. **Update calculator form** to add input field and styling
5. **Update complexity detection** to check if date is within 30 days

### Production Requirements Included:
- Validate dd/mm/yyyy format only (not yyyy-mm-dd)
- Handle invalid dates (31/02/2024 → null)
- Handle empty/undefined dates (no errors)
- Court date is optional
- Alert priority (court date > high value)

### Testing Guidance:
- Specific test dates from December 18, 2024
- Examples of dates that should/shouldn't trigger alerts
- Console log expectations

### Updated Progress Tracking:
- Task 4 now shows 2-3 hours (was 1-2 hours)
- Added sub-steps for Task 4 with court date as 4c
- Updated total time estimate: 16-27 hours (was 15-25)

### Updated Success Criteria:
- Added "Court date feature working (Australian dd/mm/yyyy format)"

## Why This Matters

**Before:** Someone reading the checklist would have no idea how to implement court dates.

**After:** Complete step-by-step instructions that match what was actually built, so:
1. Opus (or future developer) knows exactly what exists
2. Feature is properly documented
3. Time estimates are realistic
4. Testing guidance is specific

## Files Changed

- `/Users/sammcdougal/d/csc/guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md`
  - Added Step 4c (court date implementation)
  - Updated Step 4d (was 4c, now testing)
  - Updated progress tracking with sub-steps
  - Updated time estimates
  - Updated success criteria

## For Opus Handoff

Now when you tell Opus "Tasks 0-4 complete including court date feature", it can read Step 4c in the checklist and see exactly what was built and how it works.

This prevents Opus from:
- Not knowing the feature exists
- Reimplementing it differently
- Breaking it accidentally
- Being confused about formData.courtDate
