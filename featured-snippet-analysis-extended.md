### Query 1: "When does child support end Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ✅ Weak snippet exists (childsupportaustralia.com)

**Snippet Content:**
> "Child support usually stops when the child turns 18 but can be extended until the end of the school year if the child is still in full-time secondary education."

**Opportunity:** 🟢 HIGH - Current snippet is brief, you can provide better answer

2. You can add edge cases (marriage, adoption, disability)

H2: When Does Child Support End in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Child support in Australia ends when the child turns 18, or at the end of the school year if they turn 18 while still in full-time secondary education. Payments can also end earlier if the child marries, enters a de facto relationship, or is adopted. For children with disabilities or those in tertiary education, adult child maintenance may be available through the Family Court, not Services Australia.

2. No dominant snippet holder
3. Common parent question
4. You can provide comprehensive answer

**Recommended Content Structure:**
```
H2: What Does Child Support Cover in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Child support in Australia covers all costs of raising a child, including food, housing, clothing, education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities. The receiving parent has full discretion over how funds are spent—there's no requirement to provide receipts or spend on specific items. Child support is a contribution toward the child's overall living expenses, not itemized reimbursement.

[Add FAQ: "Do I need to show receipts?"]

### Query 3: "Is child support mandatory in Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ✅ Snippet exists (walkerpender.com.au)

**Snippet Content:**
> "In Australia, child support is mandatory under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. This law ensures that children continue to receive financial support from both parents, even if the parents are separated or divorced."

**Opportunity:** 🟡 MODERATE - Snippet exists but you can compete

**Why You Can Win:**
1. Add context about private agreements vs CSA assessment
2. Explain when it's NOT mandatory (equal income + equal care)
3. Add consequences of non-payment
4. More comprehensive answer

**Recommended Content Structure:**
```
H2: Is Child Support Mandatory in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Yes, child support is mandatory in Australia under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. Both parents must financially support their children until age 18, regardless of relationship status or care arrangements. However, parents can choose private agreements instead of Services Australia assessment. The only exception is when both parents have equal income and equal care (50/50), resulting in zero liability.
```

### Query 4: "Can I reduce child support Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ❌ NO CLEAR SNIPPET

**Top Results:** Various law firms, no dominant answer

**Opportunity:** 🟢 VERY HIGH - No clear snippet, high search volume

H2: Can I Reduce Child Support in Australia?

Yes, you can reduce child support in Australia through three main ways: 1) Increase your care time (more nights = lower payments), 2) Apply for a Change of Assessment if special circumstances exist (high contact costs, child's income, etc.), or 3) Negotiate a binding child support agreement with the other parent. Simply earning less or having a new baby doesn't automatically reduce payments.
```

### Query 5: "How far back can child support be backdated Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ✅ Snippet exists (childsupportaustralia.com)

**Snippet Content:**
> "In typical cases, the CSA can backdate these payments up to 3 months from when the request was made. However, in exceptional circumstances—such as illness, threats from the payer, or other significant events that prevented timely action—backdating can be extended to 9 months."

**Opportunity:** 🟡 MODERATE - Snippet exists but you can compete

**Why You Can Win:**
1. Add context about arrears (7 years)
2. Explain difference between backdating new assessment vs collecting arrears

H2: How Far Back Can Child Support Be Backdated in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Child support in Australia can be backdated up to 3 months from your application date, or 9 months in exceptional circumstances (illness, threats, family violence). However, this only applies to new assessments. If you're owed unpaid child support (arrears), Services Australia can collect up to 7 years of back payments. Child support is never backdated before the application date.

## 🎯 MEDIUM-PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES

### Query 6: "Child support vs spousal maintenance Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ✅ Snippet exists (mondaq.com)

**Snippet Content:**
> "In Australia, we don't actually use 'alimony', the law calls it spousal maintenance under the Family Law Act 1975."

**Opportunity:** 🟡 MODERATE - Snippet is weak, focuses on terminology not comparison

**Recommended Content Structure:**
```
H2: Child Support vs Spousal Maintenance in Australia

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Child support and spousal maintenance are separate in Australia. Child support is mandatory, formula-based, and paid for children under 18 through Services Australia. Spousal maintenance is discretionary, court-ordered, and paid to an ex-partner who cannot support themselves. You can pay both simultaneously. Child support is automatic; spousal maintenance requires a court application proving financial need.
```

---

### Query 7: "Do both parents pay child support in Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ❌ NO CLEAR SNIPPET

**Opportunity:** 🟢 HIGH - Common misconception, no clear answer

**Recommended Content Structure:**
```
H2: Do Both Parents Pay Child Support in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Technically yes—both parents contribute to child support in Australia. The formula considers both incomes and care arrangements. However, only the higher-income parent makes actual payments to the other. If you earn more but have less care, you pay. If you earn less but have more care, you receive. With equal income and equal care (50/50), no one pays.
```

**Current Snippet Status:** ❌ NO CLEAR SNIPPET

**Opportunity:** 🟢 VERY HIGH - Complex topic, no dominant answer

**Your Existing Content:** ✅ You have `app/blog/child-support-self-employed.tsx`

**Recommended Optimization:**
```
H2: How Is Child Support Calculated for Self-Employed Parents in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
Self-employed parents in Australia pay child support based on their taxable income from tax returns, not business revenue. Services Australia uses your most recent tax assessment, which can be 12-18 months old. If your income changes significantly, you can request an income estimate. The other parent can apply for a Change of Assessment (Reason 8) if they believe you're hiding income through business structures.
```

---

### Query 9: "What happens if I don't pay child support Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ❌ NO CLEAR SNIPPET

**Opportunity:** 🟢 HIGH - Important compliance question

**Recommended Content Structure:**
```
H2: What Happens If I Don't Pay Child Support in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
If you don't pay child support in Australia, Services Australia can take enforcement action including: deducting payments from your wages or tax refunds, intercepting Centrelink payments, suspending your passport, registering a charge on your property, or referring you to court. Penalties include fines up to $13,200 and potential imprisonment. You cannot avoid child support by quitting your job or leaving the country.
```

### Query 10: "Child support new partner income Australia"

**Current Snippet Status:** ❌ NO CLEAR SNIPPET

**Opportunity:** 🟢 VERY HIGH - Common question, no clear answer

**Your Existing Content:** ✅ You have `app/blog/new-partner-income-child-support.tsx`

**Recommended Optimization:**
```
H2: Does My New Partner's Income Affect Child Support in Australia?

Paragraph (50-60 words):
No, your new partner's income does NOT affect child support in Australia. The formula only considers the biological or adoptive parents' incomes. However, if your new partner pays most household expenses, allowing you to hide income or reduce work hours, the other parent can apply for a Change of Assessment (Reason 8) arguing your actual capacity to pay is higher.
