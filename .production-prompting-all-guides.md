# Production Prompting Guidance - Added to All Guides

## What Was Done

Added production code prompting guidance to ALL guide documents, not just Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md.

## Files Updated

### 1. `guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md` ✅ (Already done)
**Location:** Line 9-60
**Added:**
- Full "💡 CRITICAL: How to Prompt Claude for Production Code" section
- Good vs bad prompt examples
- Why it matters (with real evidence from testing)
- Updated all task prompts (Tasks 1, 3, 5d, 5f) with production requirements

### 2. `docs/CLAUDE.md` ✅ (Just updated)
**Location:** After "Cost Reality" section (line ~120)
**Added:**
- Full production prompting guidance
- Same examples as Phase 1 checklist
- Reference to Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md for detailed examples
- Updated "Creating New Phase Guides" section to require production prompting in ALL future phases

### 3. `guides/README.md` ✅ (Just updated)
**Location:** Top of file (line 5)
**Added:**
- Warning to read production prompting section before using any guide
- TL;DR summary
- Reference to Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md as source of truth

## Why These 3 Files?

### `guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md`
- **Current working document** - Developer uses this now
- Most detailed examples with actual task prompts

### `docs/CLAUDE.md`
- **Instructions for Claude** - Read by AI assistants when opening repo
- Tells future Claudes how to generate code correctly
- Includes instructions for creating Phase 2, 3, 4 guides

### `guides/README.md`
- **Entry point** for all guides - Developer sees this first
- Warning system to read production prompting before proceeding
- Applies to ALL phases

## What This Achieves

### For Current Work (Phase 1):
- Developer knows how to prompt properly NOW
- Updated prompts in CHECKLIST.md guide them

### For Future Phases:
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` instructs Claude to include production prompting in Phase 2/3/4 guides
- Developer reminded by `guides/README.md` when starting new phases
- Consistent quality across all phases

### For Opus Handoff:
- Opus will read `docs/CLAUDE.md` and see production standards
- Opus will read Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md and see examples
- Opus knows to apply these standards to Tasks 1-5

## The Chain of References

```
guides/README.md (warning)
    ↓
    "Read Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md"
    ↓
guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md (detailed guidance + examples)
    ↓
    Referenced by docs/CLAUDE.md
    ↓
docs/CLAUDE.md (instructions for AI + future phase creation)
    ↓
    Ensures Phase 2/3/4 guides include same guidance
```

## Testing the Chain

**Scenario 1: Developer starts Phase 2**
1. Opens `guides/README.md` → sees warning
2. Reads Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md production section
3. Asks Claude for Phase 2 guide
4. Claude reads `docs/CLAUDE.md` → includes production prompting in Phase 2 guide
5. Developer uses production prompts from Phase 2 guide

**Scenario 2: New Claude session on repo**
1. Claude reads `docs/CLAUDE.md` first (standard practice)
2. Sees production prompting guidance
3. Sees instructions for creating future phase guides
4. Creates Phase 2/3/4 guides with production standards built-in

**Scenario 3: Opus reviewing Phase 1 code**
1. Reads handoff message referencing CHECKLIST.md
2. Reads `docs/CLAUDE.md` for repo context
3. Sees production standards in both places
4. Reviews Tasks 1-4 against production checklist
5. Rewrites anything not meeting standards

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Production prompting in `guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md`
- [x] Production prompting in `docs/CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Warning in `guides/README.md`
- [x] `docs/CLAUDE.md` instructs future phase guides to include it
- [x] Examples provided in Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md
- [x] References cross-link properly

## What's NOT Updated

**Don't need updating:**
- `guides/phase1/TESTING.md` - Just testing procedures, no code generation
- `guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Just debugging, no code generation
- `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` - Strategic planning, references guides/
- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Reference material
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - History

These files don't contain Claude prompts, so they don't need production prompting guidance.

## Summary

Production prompting guidance is now:
✅ In current phase guide (Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md)
✅ In AI instructions (docs/CLAUDE.md)
✅ In guides entry point (guides/README.md)
✅ Required for all future phases (via docs/CLAUDE.md)

This creates a self-reinforcing system where good prompting practices propagate through all phases automatically.
