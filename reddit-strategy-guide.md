### Week 3: First Posts (3 hours total)

**Objective:** Launch with 3 carefully crafted posts to highest-value subreddits


**POST 1: r/AusLegal (Monday 9am AEST)**

```
Title: Built a Free Australian Child Support Calculator - Feedback Welcome

Body:
I've built a free calculator that implements the Services Australia 8-step child support formula (2026 rates). Sharing here in case it's useful for anyone navigating the system.

It handles scenarios the government calculator doesn't cover:
- Shared care arrangements (care percentage impacts)
- Multiple children across different relationships
- Income support and Centrelink payments
- Change of Assessment factors
- Court-ordered child support

Link: [your URL]

No registration, no data collection. Built it because the formula is genuinely confusing and I wanted to help people understand their obligations/entitlements.

I'm not a lawyer - this is a calculation tool, not legal advice. For complex situations, always consult a family lawyer.

Happy to answer questions about how the formula works or take feedback on the calculator.

(Mods: Let me know if this violates any rules)
```

**Why this works:**
- Transparent about being the builder (no fake personal story)
- Frames as "sharing" and "feedback welcome" (less promotional)
- Still lists value propositions
- Clear disclaimer about not being a lawyer
- Invites engagement without false pretense
- Honest about purpose: "wanted to help people understand"

---

**POST 2: r/AusFinance (Wednesday 10am AEST)**

```
Title: Free Child Support Calculator - Financial Planning Tool (2026 Formula)

Body:
Built a free calculator for anyone planning separation finances or trying to understand child support obligations.

The government's calculator is basic and doesn't handle:
- How shared care percentages affect payments
- Multiple children across different relationships
- Centrelink income support impacts
- Change of Assessment scenarios

This calculator implements the full Services Australia 8-step formula (2026 rates): [your URL]

No registration, no data collection. Built it to help people understand a genuinely confusing system.

Not financial advice - just a calculation tool. For complex situations, consult a financial planner or family lawyer.

Questions about the formula welcome.
```

**Why this works:**
- Transparent about being the builder
- Frames as financial planning tool (fits subreddit theme)
- Uses bullet points for scannability
- Clear disclaimers
- Less "personal story" that could be fact-checked

---

**POST 3: r/AusParents (Friday 7pm AEST)**

```
Title: Free Child Support Calculator - For Separated Parents

Body:
Built a free child support calculator that might help anyone navigating separation with kids.

The government calculator is basic and doesn't handle:
- Shared care arrangements (like 60/40 splits)
- Multiple children across different relationships
- Income support impacts

This one implements the full Services Australia formula (2026 rates): [your URL]

Completely free, no registration. Built it because the system is genuinely confusing and I wanted to help parents understand their obligations/entitlements.

Not legal advice - just a calculation tool. For complex situations, always consult a family lawyer.

Happy to answer questions about how the formula works.
```

**Why this works:**
- Transparent about being the builder
- Still mentions specific scenarios (60/40) without claiming personal experience
- Supportive tone fits community
- Clear disclaimers
- Honest about purpose

---

**Time commitment:** 1 hour to write posts, 2 hours to respond to comments over 48 hours

**Critical:** Respond to EVERY comment within 24 hours. Engagement drives visibility.

---

### Week 4: Expand & Engage (2 hours total)

**Objective:** Post to remaining TIER 1 subreddits, join TIER 2 subreddits

**POST 4: r/australia (Monday 9am AEST)**

```
Title: Free Australian Child Support Calculator (2026 Formula)

Body:
Built a free calculator that implements the Services Australia 8-step child support formula.

Handles shared care, multiple children, income support, and Change of Assessment factors that the government calculator doesn't cover.

Link: [your URL]

No registration, no data collection. Not legal advice - just a calculation tool.

Hope this helps someone navigating the system.
```

**Why this works:**
- Extremely brief (respects busy subreddit)
- Transparent about being the builder
- No fake personal story
- Clear disclaimers

---

**POST 5: r/AskAnAustralian (Wednesday 2pm AEST)**

```
Title: How does child support actually work in Australia?

Body:
Seeing a lot of confusion about child support, so here's a quick explainer:

**The Basics:**
Services Australia uses an 8-step formula that considers:
- Both parents' incomes
- Number of children
- Care percentage (how many nights each parent has the kids)
- Cost of children (based on combined income)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "50/50 care means no child support" - Not true. Income difference still matters.
- "The government calculator is accurate" - It's basic. Doesn't handle complex scenarios.
- "Child support stops at 18" - Can continue if child is in full-time study.

**Shared Care Impact:**
If you have kids 35%+ of nights, your child support changes significantly. The formula adjusts for both care costs and income.

For anyone wanting to calculate their specific situation, I built a free calculator that implements the full formula: [your URL]

No registration, no data collection. Not legal advice - just a calculation tool.

Questions welcome - happy to explain how the formula works.
```

**Why this works:**
- Educational first, promotional second
- Addresses common misconceptions (high value)
- Q&A format fits subreddit perfectly
- Calculator mentioned naturally, transparently
- Clear disclaimers

---

**Additional tasks:**
- Join TIER 2 subreddits (AusProperty, fiaustralia, city subreddits)
- Continue commenting on child support questions in TIER 1 subreddits
- Monitor analytics: track which posts drive traffic

**Time commitment:** 1 hour for posts, 1 hour for engagement

---

## Critical: Authenticity & Post History

### Your Reddit Account Will Be Scrutinized

**Reality check:** Reddit users WILL check your post history. You cannot hide it.

**What they'll see:**
- How old your account is
- All your previous posts and comments
- Whether you only post promotional content
- If your "personal story" matches your history

**The authenticity problem:**
- ❌ "I recently went through separation" - Looks fake if account is new or only promotional
- ❌ "We do 60/40 care" - Specific claims can be fact-checked against your history
- ❌ "I've been through it" - Empty account history contradicts this

**The solution: Be transparent**
- ✅ "I built this calculator" - Honest, no fake backstory
- ✅ "Sharing in case it's useful" - Transparent intent
- ✅ "Feedback welcome" - Invites genuine engagement
- ✅ "Not legal advice - just a tool" - Clear disclaimers

### Building a Credible Account

**Option 1: Use existing personal account (if you have one)**
- Pros: Real history, established credibility
- Cons: Mixes personal and business

**Option 2: Create new account, be transparent**
- Pros: Separate business identity
- Cons: New account = less credibility
- **Critical:** Build karma for 2 weeks before ANY promotional posts
- Post helpful comments about child support, separation, finance
- Don't mention your calculator until Week 3

**Option 3: Hire someone who genuinely went through separation**
- Pros: Authentic story, real credibility
- Cons: Ethical concerns, still needs disclosure
- **Must disclose:** "I helped build this tool" or similar

### What Works: Transparent Builder Approach

**Frame yourself as:**
- Developer/builder who saw a problem
- Someone who studied the formula extensively
- Tool creator trying to help people understand a confusing system

**Don't claim:**
- Personal separation experience (unless true and verifiable)
- Specific custody arrangements (unless true)
- "I've been through it" (unless your account history supports this)

**Example transparent framing:**
> "I built this after seeing how confusing the child support formula is. Spent weeks reading the Child Support Guide to implement it correctly. Not a lawyer, just a developer trying to help people understand the system."

This is honest, credible, and doesn't require a fake backstory.

## Reddit Posting Best Practices

### Optimal Timing (AEST/AEDT)

**Best times:**
- Weekdays: 8-10am (morning commute, work breaks)
- Weekdays: 7-9pm (evening browsing)
- Weekends: 9am-12pm (lazy morning browsing)

**Worst times:**
- Late night: 12am-6am (low activity)
- Mid-afternoon: 2-4pm (work hours, low engagement)
- Friday nights: 9pm+ (people out socializing)

**Critical window:** First 30 minutes after posting determine visibility. If you get 5-10 upvotes quickly, Reddit's algorithm pushes your post higher.

---

### Title Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Be clear and descriptive
- ✅ Include "Free" and "Australian" 
- ✅ Mention specific benefit ("Calculator", "Tool", "Guide")
- ✅ Use natural language, not marketing speak
- ✅ Keep under 100 characters for mobile readability

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use clickbait or salesy language
- ❌ ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- ❌ Misleading or exaggerated claims
- ❌ Generic titles ("Check this out", "You need this")

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Understanding the Australian Child Support Formula - Free Calculator"
- ✅ "PSA: Free Child Support Calculator (2026 Formula)"
- ❌ "AMAZING Child Support Tool - You Won't Believe This!"
- ❌ "The ONLY Calculator You'll Ever Need"

---

### Body Content Guidelines

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Personal story or problem statement
2. **Value proposition** (bullet points): What your tool does
3. **Link** (1 sentence): Clear, no-pressure invitation
4. **Credibility** (1 sentence): Acknowledge limitations
5. **Engagement** (1 sentence): Invite questions

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with personal story or relatable problem
- ✅ Use bullet points for scannability
- ✅ Mention "free" and "no registration"
- ✅ Acknowledge you're not a lawyer
- ✅ Invite questions and engagement
- ✅ Show respect to moderators

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Pure self-promotion without context
- ❌ Overly technical jargon
- ❌ Claim to replace professional advice
- ❌ Defensive or argumentative tone
- ❌ Multiple links or calls-to-action

---

### Engagement Rules

**Response strategy:**
- Respond to EVERY comment within 24 hours
- Be helpful, not defensive, if criticized
- Acknowledge limitations: "This handles standard cases, complex situations need a lawyer"
- Don't argue with skeptics - thank them for feedback
- Upvote good questions - encourages more engagement

**Comment templates:**

**For skepticism:**
> "Fair question. It implements the official Services Australia 8-step formula from the Child Support Guide. I can share the formula documentation if you'd like to verify. That said, for complex cases, always consult a lawyer."

**For "why not use government calculator?":**
> "You're right! The government calculator is great for basic cases. This one handles more complex scenarios like shared care, multiple children, and Change of Assessment factors that the government calculator doesn't cover."

**For "are you making money?":**
> "No revenue from the calculator itself - it's completely free. I do connect people with lawyers if their situation is complex, but that's optional and separate from the calculator."

**For technical questions:**
> "Great question. The formula works like this: [explain]. If you want to see the official documentation, it's in the Child Support Guide section [X]."

## Reddit Rules & Self-Promotion

### The 9:1 Rule (Critical)

**90% of your Reddit activity should be genuine contribution. Only 10% can be promotional.**

**In practice:**
- For every 1 promotional post, make 9 helpful comments
- Build karma before promoting (50-100 minimum)
- Don't spam the same link across multiple subreddits in one day
- Space out promotional posts (1 per week maximum)

**Violation consequences:**
- Shadowban (your posts invisible to others)
- Subreddit ban (permanent removal)
- Account suspension (Reddit-wide ban)

---

### Subreddit-Specific Rules

**r/AusFinance:**
- No direct advertising or spam
- Must provide genuine value, not just promote
- Financial advice disclaimer required ("I'm not a financial advisor")
- Expect skepticism - be ready to explain methodology
- Moderators actively remove low-effort promotion

**r/AusLegal:**
- NEVER give legal advice (you're not a lawyer)
- Tools and resources generally allowed if genuinely helpful
- Must be accurate - expect questions about formula correctness
- Acknowledge limitations clearly

**r/australia:**
- VERY strict on self-promotion
- Must be relevant to Australians (obvious fit)
- Expect heavy moderation - be respectful if removed
- Political discussions can derail posts - stay neutral

**r/AusParents:**
- Small community, very supportive
- Personal stories work well
- Less strict on self-promotion if genuinely helpful
- Engage genuinely with other parents first

**r/AskAnAustralian:**
- Q&A format - answer questions first, promote second
- Can share tools in answers to relevant questions
- Educational content highly valued
- International audience - clarify Australian context

---

## Handling Common Objections

### "This is spam"

**Response:**
> "I understand it might look promotional. I built this after going through separation myself and genuinely want to help others. It's completely free with no registration. Happy to remove if mods think it's inappropriate."

**Why this works:** Acknowledges concern, shows transparency, defers to moderators

---

### "Why should we trust this?"

**Response:**
> "Fair question. It implements the official Services Australia 8-step formula from the Child Support Guide. I can share the formula documentation if you'd like to verify. That said, for complex cases, always consult a lawyer."

**Why this works:** Provides verification path, acknowledges limitations

---

### "The government already has a calculator"

**Response:**
> "You're right! The government calculator is great for basic cases. This one handles more complex scenarios like shared care percentages, multiple children across relationships, and Change of Assessment factors that the government calculator doesn't cover."

**Why this works:** Agrees first, then differentiates without criticizing government tool

---

### "Are you making money from this?"

**Response:**
> "No revenue from the calculator itself - it's completely free. I do connect people with lawyers if their situation is complex, but that's optional and separate from the calculator."

**Why this works:** Transparent about business model, emphasizes free tool

---

### Post gets downvoted or removed

**Response:**
- Don't repost immediately (looks desperate)
- Wait 1-2 weeks minimum
- Revise approach based on feedback
- Try different subreddit with adjusted messaging
- Learn from what didn't work

---

## Advanced Strategies (Month 2+)

### 1. Answer Existing Questions

**Search for:**
- "child support australia"
- "how much child support"
- "child support calculator"
- "services australia formula"
- "shared care child support"

**Strategy:**
- Answer helpfully WITHOUT immediately mentioning calculator
- Provide 2-3 paragraphs of genuine value
- Mention calculator naturally at end: "If you want to calculate your specific situation, I built a free tool: [link]"

**Why this works:** Helps people who are actively searching, builds credibility

---

### 2. Create Educational Content

**Post ideas:**
- "5 things I wish I knew about child support before separation"
- "Common child support calculation mistakes"
- "How shared care percentages actually affect child support"
- "What the government child support calculator doesn't tell you"
- "Change of Assessment: When to apply and what to expect"

**Format:**
- Educational first, promotional last
- Share calculator as "tool I built to understand this"
- Invite questions and discussion

**Why this works:** Provides value, positions you as expert, natural promotion

---

### 3. AMA (Ask Me Anything) - Month 3+

**After building credibility:**

```
Title: I built a child support calculator and learned way too much about the Services Australia formula - AMA

Body:
After going through separation, I spent months reading the Child Support Guide and building a calculator that implements the full 8-step formula.

I'm not a lawyer, but I've become an accidental expert on how the calculations work - shared care, multiple children, income support, Change of Assessment factors, etc.

Happy to answer questions about how the formula works, common misconceptions, or anything else child support related.

Calculator is here if you want to try it: [link]

Ask me anything!
```

**Strategy:**
- Answer questions for 2-3 hours actively
- Be genuinely helpful, not promotional
- Builds massive credibility and visibility

**Why this works:** Positions you as expert, drives engagement, natural promotion

---

### 4. Cross-Promotion with Blog

**Strategy:**
- Mention Reddit discussions in blog articles
- Share valuable blog articles on Reddit (if genuinely helpful)
- Build ecosystem of content that reinforces each other

**Example:**
- Write blog post: "10 Most Common Child Support Questions (From Reddit)"
- Share on Reddit: "I compiled the most common child support questions I've seen on Reddit - here's a guide"

**Why this works:** Provides value, drives traffic both directions

---

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Required Disclaimers

**Always include:**
- "I'm not a lawyer - this is a tool, not legal advice"
- "For complex situations, consult a family lawyer"
- "This calculator implements the official formula but may not cover all edge cases"

**Why this matters:** Protects you legally, sets appropriate expectations

---

### Privacy & Data Handling

**In Reddit comments:**
- NEVER ask for personal information
- Don't provide specific legal advice to individuals
- Refer complex cases to lawyers via your inquiry form

**Example response:**
> "Your situation sounds complex. I'd recommend using the calculator to get a baseline, then speaking with a family lawyer. If you'd like, I can connect you with lawyers who specialize in this - there's an inquiry form on the site."

---

### Transparency

**Be upfront about:**
- You built the tool (don't hide it)
- You connect people with lawyers (but it's optional)
- The calculator is free, lead generation is separate

**Why this matters:** Reddit values transparency. Hiding commercial aspects backfires.
