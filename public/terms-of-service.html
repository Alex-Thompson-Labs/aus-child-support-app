        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        
        <p><strong>What we provide:</strong></p>
        
        <p>We operate a free online child support calculator that estimates child support payments based on the Services Australia child support formula. Our Service includes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculator Tool</strong>: Implements the official 8-step child support assessment formula with 6 formula variants</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Estimates</strong>: Provides immediate calculations based on information you provide</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity Detection</strong>: Identifies situations that may benefit from professional legal advice</li>
            <li><strong>Lawyer Referral Service</strong>: Connects users with independent family law practitioners (optional)</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Content</strong>: Blog articles and resources about Australian child support law</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What we DON'T provide:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal advice</strong>: We are not lawyers and do not provide legal advice</li>
            <li><strong>Financial advice</strong>: We are not financial advisors or accountants</li>
            <li><strong>Official assessments</strong>: Only Services Australia can provide binding child support assessments</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed accuracy</strong>: Calculator results are estimates only (see Section 3)</li>
            <li><strong>Lawyer services</strong>: Lawyers we refer are independent contractors (see Section 5)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Our role:</strong> We provide a free estimation tool and connect users with independent legal professionals. We do not practice law, provide professional advice, or guarantee outcomes.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>3. Calculator Accuracy & Limitations</h2>
        
        <p><strong>CRITICAL: Please read this section carefully.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Estimates Only, Not Legal Advice</h3>
        
        <p>The calculator provides <strong>estimates only</strong>. Results are not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Official child support assessments</li>
            <li>Legal advice or recommendations</li>
            <li>Financial advice or tax guidance</li>
            <li>Binding determinations of your obligations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Our calculator gives you a rough idea of potential child support amounts, but it cannot replace professional advice or official assessments.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Why Results May Differ from Services Australia</h3>
        
        <p>Our calculator implements the official Services Australia formula, but results may differ from official assessments due to:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Quality Issues:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incomplete or inaccurate information you provide</li>
            <li>Estimates vs. actual income figures</li>
            <li>Missing details about your specific situation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Formula Complexity:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edge cases not fully captured by our implementation</li>
            <li>Rounding differences in multi-step calculations</li>
            <li>Timing differences (assessment periods, income years)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Special Circumstances:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Court orders that override standard formula</li>
            <li>Change of Assessment applications (10 special factors)</li>
            <li>Binding child support agreements</li>
            <li>International cases or reciprocating jurisdictions</li>
            <li>Income from self-employment, trusts, or complex sources</li>
            <li>Relevant dependent children in other relationships</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>System Limitations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our calculator cannot access Services Australia's internal data</li>
            <li>We cannot replicate all nuances of manual assessments</li>
            <li>Software bugs or errors may occur despite our best efforts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.3 Do Not Rely Solely on This Calculator</h3>
        
        <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not make important legal or financial decisions based solely on calculator results.</p>
        
        <p>You should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consult Services Australia</strong> for an official child support assessment</li>
            <li><strong>Seek legal advice</strong> from a qualified family lawyer if your situation is complex</li>
            <li><strong>Get financial advice</strong> if you have questions about tax implications or financial planning</li>
            <li><strong>Verify all information</strong> before taking action based on calculator results</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.4 No Professional Relationship</h3>
        
        <p>Using this calculator does not create:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A lawyer-client relationship</li>
            <li>An accountant-client relationship</li>
            <li>A financial advisor-client relationship</li>
            <li>Any professional duty of care owed to you</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> We're providing a free tool, not professional services. You remain responsible for your own decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>3.5 Formula Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>Our calculator implements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formula 1</strong>: Basic formula (both parents above self-support amount)</li>
            <li><strong>Formula 2</strong>: One parent below self-support amount</li>
            <li><strong>Formula 3</strong>: Both parents below self-support amount</li>
            <li><strong>Formula 4</strong>: Income below minimum annual rate threshold</li>
            <li><strong>Formula 5</strong>: Non-parent carer situations</li>
            <li><strong>Formula 6</strong>: Multiple case adjustments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, we cannot guarantee our implementation matches Services Australia's internal systems in all scenarios.</p>

        <h2>5. Lawyer Referrals</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 How the Referral Service Works</h3>
        
        <p>If our complexity detection identifies that your situation may benefit from legal advice, we may:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Display an alert recommending you speak with a family lawyer</li>
            <li>Offer to connect you with independent family law practitioners</li>
            <li>Collect your contact information (with your consent)</li>
            <li>Share your case summary with lawyers who may be able to assist</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>This is optional.</strong> You can use the calculator without providing any contact information or requesting lawyer referrals.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Lawyers Are Independent Contractors</h3>
        
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Lawyers in our referral network are independent legal practitioners. They are NOT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our employees</li>
            <li>Our partners or joint venture participants</li>
            <li>Our agents or representatives</li>
            <li>Under our supervision or control</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Each lawyer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operates their own independent law practice</li>
            <li>Sets their own fees and terms of service</li>
            <li>Maintains their own professional indemnity insurance</li>
            <li>Is solely responsible for the legal services they provide</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 No Endorsement or Guarantee</h3>
        
        <p>We do NOT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Endorse or recommend any specific lawyer</li>
            <li>Guarantee the quality, competence, or suitability of any lawyer</li>
            <li>Supervise or monitor lawyer conduct or case outcomes</li>
            <li>Verify lawyer credentials beyond basic registration checks</li>
            <li>Guarantee that a lawyer will accept your case</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> We connect you with lawyers, but you must do your own due diligence. Check their credentials, experience, and fees before engaging them.</p>
        
        <h3>5.4 Not Liable for Lawyer Conduct</h3>
        
        <p>We are NOT liable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lawyer negligence, errors, or professional misconduct</li>
            <li>Disputes between you and a lawyer</li>
            <li>Case outcomes or legal results</li>
            <li>Lawyer fees, billing disputes, or refund claims</li>
            <li>Breach of lawyer-client confidentiality by the lawyer</li>
            <li>Any loss or damage arising from lawyer services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Your relationship with the lawyer is separate from your use of our Service.</strong> Any disputes with a lawyer must be resolved directly with them or through appropriate professional complaint channels (e.g., Legal Services Commissioner).</p>
        
        <h3>5.5 Lawyer Terms Apply</h3>
        
        <p>When you engage a lawyer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The lawyer's own terms of service and fee agreement apply</li>
            <li>The lawyer's privacy policy governs their handling of your information</li>
            <li>You are bound by the lawyer's professional obligations and rules</li>
            <li>We are not a party to your lawyer-client relationship</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.2 Consent Mechanism</h3>
        
        <p>When you submit the lawyer inquiry form, you must check a consent box that states:</p>

        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> We've built this tool carefully, but we can't promise it's perfect. Use it at your own risk.</p>
        
        <h3>8.2 Limitation of Liability</h3>
        
        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY AUSTRALIAN LAW:</strong></p>
        
        <p>We are NOT liable for any loss or damage arising from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculator errors, inaccuracies, or miscalculations</li>
            <li>Reliance on calculator results for legal or financial decisions</li>
            <li>Service interruptions, downtime, or technical failures</li>

            <li>Your violation of these Terms or applicable laws</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Types of loss we are not liable for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct losses (e.g., incorrect child support payments made)</li>
            <li>Indirect losses (e.g., legal fees, court costs, financial penalties)</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Maximum liability:</strong> If we are found liable despite these limitations, our total liability is limited to $100 AUD or the amount you paid to use the Service (whichever is greater). Since the Service is free for users, this means $100 AUD maximum.</p>
        
        <h3>8.3 Australian Consumer Law Rights Preserved</h3>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer rights you have under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) or other applicable Australian consumer protection laws that cannot be excluded by agreement.
        </div>
        
        <p>Under the ACL, you have certain guaranteed rights (called "consumer guarantees") that cannot be excluded. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Services must be provided with due care and skill</li>
            <li>Services must be fit for the purpose you tell us about</li>
            <li>Services must be provided within a reasonable time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If we breach a consumer guarantee that cannot be excluded, our liability is limited to (at our option):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Re-supplying the Service, or</li>
            <li>Paying the cost of having the Service re-supplied</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> We're limiting our liability as much as Australian law allows, but we can't take away your basic consumer rights.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> You agree to protect us from legal claims that arise from your misuse of the Service.</p>
        
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Australian Child Support Calculator, its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
            <li>Your violation of any applicable laws or regulations</li>
            <li>Your violation of any third-party rights (privacy, intellectual property, etc.)</li>
            <li>Your provision of false, inaccurate, or misleading information</li>
            <li>Your misuse of calculator results or reliance on inaccurate estimates</li>
            <li>Any dispute between you and a lawyer you engaged through our referral service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you use the calculator to harass your ex-partner, and they sue us, you agree to cover our legal costs and any damages.</p>
        
        <p>This indemnification obligation survives termination of these Terms.</p>

        <h3>12.3 Acceptance of Changes</h3>
        
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>13. General Provisions</h2>
        
        <h3>13.1 Severability</h3>
        
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        
        <p>The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, or if that is not possible, it will be severed from these Terms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> If one part of these Terms is thrown out by a court, the rest still applies.</p>
        
        <h3>13.2 Entire Agreement</h3>
        
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</p>

        <h3>13.3 No Waiver</h3>
        
        <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it in the future.</p>
        
        <p>Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What this means:</strong> Just because we don't immediately act on a violation doesn't mean we've given up our rights.</p>

        <h3>13.4 Assignment</h3>
        
        <p>You may not assign, transfer, or delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent.</p>

        <h3>13.5 Relationship of Parties</h3>
        
        <p>Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us.</p>
        
        <p>You are an independent user of the Service, and we are an independent service provider.</p>
        
        <h3>13.6 Force Majeure</h3>

        <h3>13.7 Interpretation</h3>
        
        <p>In these Terms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Including" means "including but not limited to"</li>
            <li>Singular includes plural and vice versa</li>
