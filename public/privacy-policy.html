      <p class="url"><strong>auschildsupport.com.au</strong></p>
      <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: January 26, 2026</em></p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Australian Child Support Calculator ("we", "us", "our") operates a lead
        generation service that helps parents estimate child support outcomes
        and connect with Australian family law firms.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling personal
        information in accordance with the
        <strong>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</strong> and the
        <strong>Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect
        personal information.
      </p>

      <h3>Business details</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Business name: ChildSupport Direct</li>
        <li>ABN: 27 925 351 253</li>
        <li>Service name: Australian Child Support Calculator</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>How Our Lead Generation Service Works</h3>
      <p>
        When you submit an inquiry for legal assistance, here's what happens:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Admin Review:</strong> Our team reviews your submission (including your name, contact details, and case information) to verify it is genuine and suitable for referral. This typically takes 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lawyer Teaser:</strong> We send a case summary to family law firms that does NOT include your name, email, or phone number. This allows lawyers to assess if your case matches their expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment & Full Disclosure:</strong> If a lawyer wishes to contact you, they pay a $50 lead fee. Only after payment do we provide your full contact details via a secure, time-limited link (called a "Secure Magic Link").
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Contact:</strong> The lawyer contacts you directly to arrange a consultation. From that point, their privacy policy governs how they handle your information.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>You will be asked to provide explicit consent before we share your information with any lawyer.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>Key Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal information:</strong> Information about you that identifies you or makes you reasonably identifiable (e.g., your name, email, phone number, income details)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sensitive information:</strong> Special categories of personal information including health information, information about family violence, criminal records, or membership of professional associations
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lead generation:</strong> Our business model where we connect parents with lawyers. Lawyers pay us a fee to receive your contact details if they are interested in your case
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secure Magic Link:</strong> A time-limited, single-use web link that allows lawyers to securely access your information after they have paid the lead fee
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> Your voluntary agreement to us collecting, using, or sharing your personal information for specific purposes
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. What personal information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal information directly from users when they use our
        calculator, submit forms, or request a legal consultation.
      </p>

      <h3>Information we may collect includes:</h3>

      <strong>Parent details</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Full name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>State or territory of residence</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Financial information</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Income details (gross or approximate)</li>
        <li>Employment status (if provided)</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Family and child details</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of children</li>
        <li>Care arrangements</li>
        <li>Relationship status</li>
        <li>Child support related inputs used in calculations</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Technical data</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Browser and device information</li>
        <li>Pages visited and interaction data</li>
        <li>Cookies and analytics data (see Section 10)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
      <p>
        Under Australian privacy law, "sensitive information" includes information about health, criminal records, family violence, or membership of professional associations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not require you to provide sensitive information to use our calculator. However, if you voluntarily provide sensitive information in your inquiry (for example, mentioning family violence or health issues affecting care arrangements), we will only collect and use it with your explicit consent and only where it is directly relevant to matching you with an appropriate lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Recommendation:</strong> If your matter involves sensitive circumstances, we recommend mentioning this in general terms only (e.g., "safety concerns") rather than providing detailed information until you are in direct contact with a lawyer.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I use the calculator anonymously?</h3>
      <p>
        You can use our calculator without providing any personal information. However, if you wish to be connected with a lawyer, we require your real name, email, and phone number so the lawyer can contact you. Anonymity is not practicable for the legal referral service.
      </p>

      <h3>Unsolicited Information</h3>
      <p>
        If we receive personal information we did not request (for example, if someone emails us sensitive details without being asked), we will determine whether we could have collected it under APP 3. If not, we will destroy or de-identify it as soon as practicable, unless legally required to retain it.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Why we collect this information</h2>
      <p>We collect personal information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide child support estimate calculations</li>
        <li>Match users with suitable Australian family law firms</li>
        <li>Forward leads to lawyers for consultation purposes (with your consent)</li>
        <li>Improve calculator accuracy and user experience</li>
        <li>Communicate with users about their enquiry</li>
        <li>Meet legal and regulatory obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We only collect information that is reasonably necessary for these
        purposes, in line with APP 3.
      </p>

      <h3>What happens if I don't provide information?</h3>
      <p>
        Use of the calculator does not require personal information. However, if you wish to be referred to a lawyer, we cannot provide this service without your name, email, and phone number.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How we use and share personal information</h2>

      <h3>Use of information</h3>
      <p>We may use your personal information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate child support calculation results</li>
        <li>Contact you regarding your enquiry</li>
        <li>Assess suitability for referral to a lawyer</li>
        <li>Improve our services and website functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sharing Information with Lawyers (Requires Your Consent)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We will NOT share your personal information with any lawyer unless you provide explicit, informed consent.</strong>
      </p>

      <h4>How consent works:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>After using the calculator, you may be offered the option to request a legal consultation</li>
        <li>If you choose to proceed, you will be asked to tick a consent checkbox confirming you agree to disclosure</li>
        <li>You can withdraw consent at any time before we share your information by emailing privacy@auschildsupport.com.au</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What lawyers receive:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Your full name, email, phone number, and state/territory</li>
        <li>Case details you provided (income, children, care arrangements, special circumstances)</li>
        <li>Your consent timestamp and IP address (for verification)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Lawyer Obligations and Limitations:</h4>
      <p>Before lawyers can receive leads, they must agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Handle your information in accordance with Australian privacy law</li>
        <li>Use your information only for the purpose of arranging a consultation</li>
        <li>Not use your information for unrelated marketing without separate consent</li>
        <li>Delete your information if you do not proceed with their services</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Important Limitation:</strong> Once we disclose your information to a lawyer, they become responsible for how they handle it. We cannot control or monitor their compliance. Lawyers who receive your information are independent legal practitioners operating under their own privacy policies and professional obligations.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have concerns about how a lawyer has handled your information, you should:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Contact the lawyer directly</li>
        <li>Complain to the Law Society in your state/territory</li>
        <li>Contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) if you believe privacy law has been breached</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        We recommend asking lawyers about their privacy practices before engaging their services.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-party disclosure</h2>
      <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Family law firms and legal practitioners</li>
        <li>
          IT service providers, hosting providers, and analytics providers
        </li>
        <li>Professional advisers where required (legal, accounting)</li>
        <li>Government authorities if required by law</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal information to data brokers or unrelated third
        parties.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse,
        interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>Security measures include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure hosting environments with encryption at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/SSL)</li>
        <li>Access controls and role-based permissions</li>
        <li>Limited access to personal data on a need-to-know basis</li>
        <li>Regular security reviews and updates</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Secure Magic Link System</h3>
      <p>
        When a lawyer pays to receive your information, we provide access via a secure, time-limited link (called a "Secure Magic Link"). This link:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expires after 7 days</li>
        <li>Can only be accessed once</li>
        <li>Requires the lawyer to be logged into our system</li>
        <li>Creates an audit trail of who accessed your information and when</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This ensures your information is not sitting in email inboxes indefinitely.
      </p>

      <h3>Data Breach Notification</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm, we will notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) as required by the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme under the Privacy Act 1988.
      </p>

      <p>
        No system is completely secure, but we take privacy protection seriously
        and regularly review our safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide our services</li>
        <li>Meet legal, regulatory, and reporting obligations</li>
        <li>Resolve disputes or enforce agreements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Typical retention periods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead data: up to 24 months</li>
        <li>Analytics data: aggregated and anonymised where possible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When information is no longer required, it is securely deleted or
        de-identified.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
      <p>Under Australian privacy law, you have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access personal information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate or outdated information</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your personal information, subject to legal limits</li>
        <li>Opt out of marketing communications</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent for disclosure to lawyers (before disclosure occurs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Request Access to Your Information</h3>
      <p>To request access to personal information we hold about you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Email privacy@auschildsupport.com.au with "Access Request" in the subject line</li>
        <li>Provide sufficient detail to identify yourself (name, email, phone number used)</li>
        <li>Specify what information you wish to access</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We will verify your identity before providing access (e.g., by confirming details you provided when submitting your inquiry).
      </p>
      <p>
        We will respond within 30 days. There is no fee for access requests unless the request is complex or voluminous, in which case we will notify you of any charges before proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In limited circumstances, we may deny access (e.g., if disclosure would pose a serious threat to someone's safety, or if the information is subject to legal privilege). If we deny access, we will explain why and inform you of your right to complain to the OAIC.
      </p>

      <h3>Correcting Your Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you believe personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, or misleading, you can request correction by emailing privacy@auschildsupport.com.au.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will respond within 30 days and take reasonable steps to correct the information.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If information has already been shared with a lawyer:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will notify the lawyer of the correction</li>
        <li>However, we cannot force the lawyer to update their records</li>
        <li>You should contact the lawyer directly to ensure they have corrected information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we refuse to correct information, we will provide written reasons and inform you of your right to request that we associate a statement with the information noting your view that it is inaccurate.
      </p>

      <h3>Accuracy of Information</h3>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to ensure personal information is accurate, up-to-date, and complete before disclosing it to lawyers. This includes a brief quality review to identify obviously incorrect or incomplete submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you realize you provided incorrect information, please contact us immediately at privacy@auschildsupport.com.au so we can update it before sharing with lawyers.
      </p>

      <h3>Marketing Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We do not send marketing emails or promotional materials unless you separately opt in.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive marketing from a lawyer you were referred to, this is governed by their privacy policy, not ours. You should contact them directly to opt out.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have opted in to receive updates from us, you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in any email or emailing privacy@auschildsupport.com.au.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our service is intended for adults (parents or guardians). We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 18.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use our calculator, you may provide information about your children (such as their ages and care arrangements). This information is used only to calculate child support estimates and, if you consent, to provide context to lawyers about your case.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not collect children's names, contact details, or other identifying information unless you voluntarily provide it in your inquiry. We recommend using general descriptions (e.g., "Child 1, age 10") rather than children's names when submitting inquiries.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Cookies and analytics</h2>
      <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improve website performance</li>
        <li>Understand how users interact with our calculator</li>
        <li>Measure traffic and usage patterns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This may include third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Vercel Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies
        may affect site functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cross-border disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        Some of our service providers store or process data outside Australia. We are transparent about where your information goes and what protections are in place.
      </p>

      <h3>Database hosting (Supabase):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary database:</strong> Sydney, Australia (your personal information remains in Australia)</li>
        <li><strong>Backup systems:</strong> May include US-based servers operated by Supabase</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Analytics providers:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> United States</li>
        <li><strong>Vercel Analytics:</strong> United States</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What this means for you:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your personal information (name, email, phone, case details) is stored primarily in Australia</li>
        <li>Technical data (IP address, browser info, page visits) may be processed in the United States</li>
