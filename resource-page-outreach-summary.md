## Key Insights from Research

### What Works:
1. **Resource pages exist** - Many organizations maintain "useful links" or "resources" sections
2. **Mission alignment** - Government, legal aid, and CLCs are mission-aligned to help people
3. **Educational value** - Universities appreciate practical tools for students
4. **Credibility matters** - Emphasize "official Services Australia formula" and "2026 rates"

### What Doesn't Work:
1. **Government portals** (myGov, DSS) - Don't link to external sites
2. **Generic searches** - Need specific site: operators and keywords
3. **Calculator-specific searches** - Too narrow, found ATAR calculators instead

### Best Approaches:
1. **Phone calls** - Fastest for Legal Aid organizations (they have phone support)
2. **Direct email** - Best for peak bodies and universities
3. **Contact forms** - Necessary for private firms (no public emails)
4. **Emphasize value** - Focus on helping their audience, not promoting your tool

### Objection Handling:
**"We don't link to external sites"**
- Response: "I understand. Would you consider it if we provided verification of accuracy?"

**"We need to review it first"**
- Response: "Absolutely. I can provide documentation of our formula implementation and testing."

**"We already link to the government calculator"**
- Response: "Great! Ours complements it by handling complex scenarios the government calculator doesn't cover."

**"What's in it for us?"**
- Response: "Better-informed clients/visitors who understand their situation before contacting you, saving time in initial consultations."
