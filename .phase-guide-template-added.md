# Complete Phase Guide Template - Added to docs/CLAUDE.md

## What Was Done

Created a comprehensive template in `docs/CLAUDE.md` that ensures ALL future phase guides (Phase 2, 3, 4) include the same quality standards as Phase 1.

## The Template Includes

### 1. Header Format (Lines 1-7)
```markdown
**Recommended Tool:** Claude Code (with Desktop Commander if needed)  
**Recommended Model:** Sonnet 4.5 ✅ (or Opus 4 for complex tasks)  
**Thinking Mode:** Keep ON/Can turn OFF (reasoning)
**Plan Mode:** See each task for guidance (use sparingly to save cost)
**Goal:** [One-sentence goal]
**Success Metric:** [Measurable metric]
```

### 2. Production Prompting Section (CRITICAL)
- Full copy of Phase 1's production prompting guidance
- Problem/Solution framework
- Good vs Bad prompt examples
- Evidence from testing
- Reminder to apply to EVERY task

### 3. Mode Explanations
- **Plan Mode vs Accept Edits** - Full explanation with visual indicators
- **Plan Mode Quick Reference** - Which tasks use Regular vs Plan mode
- **Shift+Tab cycling** instructions

### 4. Tool Guidance
- Primary: Claude Code (when to use)
- Secondary: Desktop Commander (when to use)
- Cost comparison
- Strategy recommendations

### 5. Thinking Mode Guidance
- When to keep ON vs turn OFF
- Specific task recommendations
- Cost considerations

### 6. Task Format (For EVERY Task)
Each task must include:
- **Difficulty rating:** 🟢🟡🔴 with reasoning
- **Time estimate:** X-Y hours/minutes
- **Prerequisites:** None / Task N complete
- **Plan Mode:** Regular mode ✅ or Plan mode ✅ with reasoning
- **Outcome:** Specific deliverables (bullet list)
- **What you're building:** 1-2 sentence explanation
- **Production-quality Claude Code Prompt:**
  ```
  [Full prompt]
  
  PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
  - Specific error handling
  - Specific validation
  - Edge cases
  
  CRITICAL: Think about what could go wrong:
  - Question 1
  - Question 2
  ```
- **Testing:** How to test
- **Done when:** Checkboxes for verification
- **Common Issues:** Issue → Solution pairs
- **Beginner Tips:** Practical advice

### 7. Supporting Sections
- Learning Resources (technology-specific)
- Tips for Using Claude Code
- Progress Tracking (with sub-steps)
- What Success Looks Like (measurable criteria)

### 8. Verification Checklist
A checklist at the end ensuring:
- All prompts include production requirements ✅
- Each task has Plan Mode guidance ✅
- Difficulty ratings are appropriate ✅
- Time estimates are realistic ✅
- Success metric is measurable ✅
- All links work ✅

## What This Achieves

### For Phase 2 Creation:
When developer completes Phase 1 and asks for Phase 2:
1. Claude reads `docs/CLAUDE.md`
2. Sees complete template with 234 lines of guidance
3. Creates Phase 2 guide matching Phase 1's quality
4. Includes all production prompting automatically
5. Uses same format/structure throughout

### For Phase 3 & 4:
Same process - template ensures consistency across ALL phases.

### For Current Phase 1:
Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md already matches this template perfectly (we built the template FROM Phase 1).

## Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (What Was There):
```markdown
**Example phase guide header:**
# Phase 2: Pilot Program - Implementation Guide
[basic structure, ~30 lines]
```

### AFTER (What's There Now):
```markdown
**Example phase guide header:**
[Complete 234-line template with:]
- Full header format
- Complete production prompting section
- All mode explanations
- Tool guidance
- Thinking mode guidance
- Complete task format with examples
- All supporting sections
- Verification checklist
```

## Files Modified

1. **`docs/CLAUDE.md`** - Lines ~210-477
   - Added complete 234-line template
   - Added 67-item verification checklist
   - Structured to copy Phase 1's format exactly

2. **`guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md`** (already done)
   - Already matches template perfectly
   - Used as source of truth

3. **`guides/README.md`** (already done)
   - Points to Phase 1 as example

## Testing the Template

**Scenario: Developer asks for Phase 2 guide**

Claude will:
1. Read MASTER_PLAN.md for Phase 2 content
2. Read docs/CLAUDE.md for template structure
3. Generate Phase 2 CHECKLIST.md using template
4. Result: Phase 2 guide with:
   - ✅ Production prompting section
   - ✅ All mode explanations
   - ✅ Production-quality task prompts
   - ✅ Same format as Phase 1
   - ✅ All verification items checked

## What's Enforced

The template ENFORCES these standards:
- Every task MUST have Plan Mode guidance
- Every prompt MUST include production requirements
- Every task MUST have Done when checkboxes
- Every task MUST have Common Issues section
- Every phase MUST have measurable success metric
- Every phase MUST have tool/model recommendations

## Summary

Phase 1 quality standards are now **locked in as a template** for all future phases:

✅ Complete 234-line template in docs/CLAUDE.md
✅ Matches Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md exactly
✅ Includes verification checklist (67 items)
✅ Enforces production prompting in every task
✅ Ensures consistency across Phases 2, 3, 4

When developer says "Phase 1 complete, create Phase 2", Claude will follow this template automatically, ensuring Phase 2 has the same quality and structure as Phase 1.

No more incomplete guides! 🎉
