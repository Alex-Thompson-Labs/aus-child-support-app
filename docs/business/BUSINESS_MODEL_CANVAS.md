## Key Strategic Decisions

### Why Database-First Approach?
**Rejected:** Email-only lead routing  
**Chosen:** Supabase database with secure storage  
**Reason:** Privacy Act 1988 compliance requires audit trails, consent tracking, deletion capability, and secure data handling. Professional appearance matters for B2B.

### Why $50 Per Lead (Not Per Booking)?
**Rejected:** $100 per confirmed booking  
**Chosen:** $50 per qualified lead  
**Reason:** Avoids complex calendar integration, simpler tracking, market rate for legal leads, immediate launch capability, no disputes about "no-shows."

### Why Manual Lead Review?
**Rejected:** Automated lead routing  
**Chosen:** Manual quality control via admin dashboard  
**Reason:** Ensures lead quality, builds lawyer trust, prevents refunds, allows personalization, sustainable at <100 leads/month.

### Why Teaser Email Workflow?
**Process:** Send case summary → Lawyer confirms interest → Charge $50 → Send full details  
**Reason:** Lawyer can't contact parent for free, you maintain control, professional appearance, reduces disputes.

### Why Validation-First Approach?
**Rejected:** Sign paying lawyers immediately without proof of lead quality  
**Chosen:** Validate with free leads first, then pitch with proof package  
**Reason:** Reduces financial risk, proves model before asking lawyers to pay, allows pricing validation ($50 may be too high), creates proof package for future pitches, enables Exclusive Partner track (client-funded ads = zero risk). Only proceed to paying lawyers if validation shows 15%+ consultation rate OR Exclusive Partner signs.
