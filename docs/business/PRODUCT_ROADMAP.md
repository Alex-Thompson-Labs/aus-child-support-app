### Key Metrics (Baseline)
- **Users:** 0 (just launched)
- **Leads/month:** 0 (validation phase - not yet generating)
- **Lawyer Partners:** 0 (validation phase - seeking 2-3 validation lawyers + 1 Exclusive Partner)
- **Monthly Revenue:** $0 (validation phase - learning over revenue)

---

## 🗺️ ROADMAP BY PHASE

---

## Phase 3A: PROOF BEFORE PITCH (January 2025)

**Goal:** Validate lead quality with free leads before asking lawyers to pay

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (Weeks 1-8)  
**Success Criteria:** 15%+ consultation rate, 2 testimonials, proof package, OR 1 Exclusive Partner signed  
**Revenue Target:** $0 (validation phase - learning over revenue)

**Philosophy:** This phase prioritizes learning and proof-building before lawyer outreach. Generate real parent inquiries, validate lead quality with 2-3 lawyers, and potentially secure one "Exclusive Partner" to fund Google Ads testing—all while spending $0 of your own money.

---

### 3A.1 Dual Launch: Organic Traffic + Exclusive Partner Outreach (Week 1-2)

**CRITICAL: Start both tracks immediately. No reason to wait.**

#### Track A: Generate Initial Organic Traffic (6-8 hours)

**Content Creation (3-4 hours):**
- [ ] Write 3 targeted blog posts on auschildsupport.com:
  - "Child Support Calculator Australia: Estimate Your Payments in 60 Seconds"
  - "8 Situations Where Child Support Gets Complicated (And You Need Legal Help)"
  - "Child Support Formula Explained: Income, Care %, and Special Circumstances"
- [ ] Answer 10-15 existing questions on:
  - Reddit: r/AusLegal, r/AusFinance (search "child support")
  - Whirlpool Forums: Relationships & Family Law section
  - Facebook: Join 3-5 Australian single parent groups

**Distribution Strategy (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] Post calculator link on Reddit r/AusLegal: "I built a free child support calculator - does this match your Services Australia estimate?" (Not promotional, genuinely asking for validation)
- [ ] Answer Whirlpool threads from past 30 days mentioning child support calculations
- [ ] In Facebook groups: Respond helpfully to posts asking about child support with calculator mention in comments

**SEO Quick Wins (1-2 hours):**
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Add Schema markup for Calculator (SoftwareApplication)
- [ ] Create Google Business Profile for "Australian Child Support Calculator"
- [ ] Get listed on Australian legal resource directories (free listings):
  - Lawpath resources section
  - LawAccess NSW community resources
  - Family Relationships Online

**Success Metrics:**
- 50-100 calculator sessions
- 5-10 inquiry completions
- Traffic costs: $0 (organic only)

#### Track B: Exclusive Partner Outreach (6-8 hours)

**PRIORITY TASK: This could eliminate need for your own ad spend entirely**

**Target Profile:**
- Family law firms with 3-10 lawyers
- Already running Google Ads (search "family lawyer [Melbourne/Sydney/Brisbane]" - note who's advertising)
- Located in major metro areas (Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane)
- NOT premium CBD firms (they don't need help with leads)

**Research firms (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] Google Search: "family lawyer Melbourne" → Identify 10-15 firms running ads
- [ ] Visit their websites → Find partner or senior associate name
- [ ] LinkedIn search: Confirm they're decision-makers
- [ ] Document: Firm name, contact name, email, practice focus

**Send outreach emails (1 hour):**
- [ ] Email 10-15 firms with Exclusive Partner pitch:
  - Subject: "Exclusive pilot: Pre-qualified child support leads for [Firm Name]"
  - Deal: Firm funds $500 in Google Ads (they control account, you manage campaigns)
  - You rebrand calculator as "Powered by [Firm Name]" for their region
  - All qualified child support leads in their city go exclusively to them for 4 weeks
  - You manage system for free during pilot
  - If it works, discuss ongoing fees. If not, they've spent ad budget they'd spend anyway

**Demo calls (3-4 hours over 2 weeks):**
- [ ] Schedule 15-min Zoom calls with responding firms
- [ ] Screen share calculator - show complexity detection
- [ ] Explain CoA reasons = pre-qualification
- [ ] Walk through lead flow: Calculator → Complex → Inquiry → Goes to them
- [ ] Show they'd control Google Ads account (you just manage campaigns)
- [ ] Ask: "Would you be willing to try this for 4 weeks with $500 of your ad budget?"

**Success Metrics:**
- 2-4 demo calls scheduled
- 1 firm interested in pilot by end of Week 2
- At least one path (A or B) showing traction

**Failure Signals:**
- Track A: Zero traffic after 2 weeks = content not reaching audience
- Track B: Zero responses to outreach = pitch wrong or targeting wrong firms
- Both tracks dead = need to rethink approach entirely

---

### 3A.2 Execute Partner Pilot OR Refine Validation Path (Week 3-4)

**Decision point: This week's actions depend on Week 1-2 Exclusive Partner results**

#### If Exclusive Partner Signed (Priority Path)

**Setup co-branded experience (3-4 hours):**
- [ ] Create region-specific landing page variation:
  - Add "[Firm Name] Partner" badge to calculator header
  - Update inquiry form: "This referral goes to [Firm Name]"
  - Add firm's logo (get from their website or request)
- [ ] Configure Google Ads with partner:
  - Help them create Google Ads account OR get added to existing account
  - Set daily budget: $15-20/day ($500 total / 30 days)
  - Create 3-5 ad variations targeting "child support calculator australia"
  - Set up conversion tracking (inquiry form submissions)
  - Geographic targeting: 20km radius around their office
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow:
  - Run test searches
  - Complete test inquiry
  - Verify firm receives email notification

**Ongoing management (2-3 hours/week):**
- [ ] Monitor ad performance daily
- [ ] Send weekly report to partner: spend, clicks, leads generated
- [ ] Forward all leads within 24 hours with context (CoA reasons, income bracket, urgency)
- [ ] Track their feedback on lead quality

**Continue organic traffic efforts (4-5 hours):**
- [ ] Keep answering Reddit/forum questions
- [ ] Monitor early organic leads
- [ ] Use any organic leads for validation lawyers (if found in Week 1-2)

**Success metric:** Partner ads running by end of Week 3, first leads flowing by Week 4

#### If No Exclusive Partner Yet (Validation Path)

**Add property settlement wealth signal (1 hour):**
- [ ] Update `/src/utils/change-of-assessment-reasons.ts`:
  - Add property settlement CoA reason at priority 5
  - ID: `property_settlement`
  - Label: "Property settlement from separation is pending or recently finalized"
  - Official CoA Reasons: ['5.2.5', '5.2.11']
  - Why: Signals wealth, active legal matter, urgency

**Find validation lawyers (8-10 hours):**
- [ ] Target: 2-3 lawyers willing to receive free leads for feedback
- [ ] Where to find:
  - Google "family lawyer [Melbourne/Sydney]" → firms running ads
  - LinkedIn: Search those firms → Find partners or senior associates
  - Law Society directories: Cross-reference firm size (3-10 lawyers)
- [ ] Send outreach email to 15-20 lawyers:
  - Subject: "Quick feedback on child support lead quality?"
  - Pitch: Willing to receive 3-5 inquiries over next few weeks (completely free) and give honest feedback
  - No strings attached - pure learning mode
- [ ] Expect: 2-4 responses, need 2-3 to commit

**Continue Exclusive Partner outreach (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] Send 5-10 more pitches to new firms
- [ ] Follow up with firms from Week 1-2 who didn't respond
- [ ] Goal: Still trying to land a partner even while validating organically

**Success Metrics:**
- Property settlement CoA reason deployed and visible in calculator
- 2-3 validation lawyers agree to receive free leads
- 15-20 inquiry form completions from organic traffic (cumulative from Week 1-4)
- 1+ Exclusive Partner demo call scheduled (still pursuing this path)

**Failure Signals:**
- <10 inquiries total after 4 weeks = organic won't scale, need paid ads
- Zero validation lawyers respond = pitch needs work
- Zero Exclusive Partner interest after 20+ outreach emails = wrong firms or offer not compelling

---

### 3A.3 Scale Whichever Path Is Working (Week 5-6)

**By now you know which experiment is working. Double down on that.**

#### If Exclusive Partner Ads Running (Best Case Scenario)

**Optimize campaign performance (3-4 hours/week):**
- [ ] Review ad metrics: CTR, cost-per-click, conversion rate
- [ ] Pause underperforming ads, scale winners
- [ ] Adjust targeting if leads coming from wrong geography
- [ ] A/B test ad copy variations

**Lead quality management (2-3 hours/week):**
- [ ] Forward all leads to partner within 24 hours
- [ ] Track which CoA reasons correlate with partner's feedback
- [ ] Weekly check-in call: "Which leads converted? What made them good/bad?"
- [ ] Refine complexity detection based on partner's conversion patterns

**Document everything for proof package:**
- [ ] Leads generated per week
- [ ] Partner's consultation booking rate
- [ ] Partner's feedback quotes
- [ ] Cost per lead from their ads

**Continue organic traffic (2 hours/week):**
- [ ] Answer new Reddit/forum posts
- [ ] Any organic leads still go to partner (exclusivity agreement)

**Success metric:** Partner books 2+ consultations from ads, wants to continue in February

#### If Validation Lawyer Path (No Partner Yet)

**Place free leads with validation lawyers (2-3 hours/week):**
- [ ] Each high-quality lead comes in → send within 24 hours with:
  - Contact details, location, income bracket
  - Complexity factors (list CoA reasons, highlight property settlement if checked)
  - Situation description, urgency level
  - Why flagged as complex (1-sentence assessment)
- [ ] Track in spreadsheet:
  - Date sent, lawyer name, lead details, lawyer feedback, consultation booked, client retained
- [ ] Follow-up sequence per lead:
  - Day 3: "Did you contact [Lead Name]? Initial feedback on quality?"
  - Day 10: "Did this convert to a consultation? If not, what was the issue?"
  - Day 30: "If they consulted, did they retain you?"
- [ ] After each lawyer receives 3-5 leads, schedule 15-min call:
  - "Of the [X] leads I sent, how many were worth your time?"
  - "What separated the good ones from bad ones?"
  - "What information was missing that you needed?"
  - "If paying $50/lead, what would make them worth it?"
  - "What conversion rate would you need to justify buying leads?"
  - "Would you pay for leads like [specific good example]?"

**Continue Exclusive Partner pursuit (2-3 hours/week):**
- [ ] Send 5 more pitches to new firms
- [ ] Follow up with previous demo calls
- [ ] If any firm shows interest, prioritize setup

**Success Metrics:**
- 10+ leads sent to validation lawyers
- 15%+ consultation rate (2-3 consultations from 10-15 leads)
- 1+ consultation converts to retained client
- Detailed feedback from 2-3 lawyers
- OR: Exclusive Partner finally signs (switch to that path)

**Failure Signals:**
- <5% consultation rate = leads are garbage, complexity filter broken
- Lawyers stop responding after first lead = quality worse than expected
- Lawyers say "fine but wouldn't pay" = business model fundamentally flawed
- Still zero Exclusive Partner interest = that path is dead

---

### 3A.4 Document Results + Execute Winning Path (Week 7-8)

#### If Exclusive Partner Landed (Client-Funded Path)

**Execute client-funded pilot:**
- [ ] Set up co-branded calculator landing page (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Configure Google Ads with their budget ($500 cap)
- [ ] Send all leads exclusively to partner firm
- [ ] Track conversion weekly with partner

**Build proof package from pilot results (4-5 hours):**
- [ ] Document lead volume generated
- [ ] Track consultation and retention rates
- [ ] Collect testimonial from partner firm
- [ ] Use data to pitch additional firms in February

**This path = zero financial risk, real market validation**

#### If No Exclusive Partner (Validation-Only Path)

**Data Analysis (3-4 hours):**
- [ ] Calculate metrics:
  - Lead→Consultation rate: [X] consultations ÷ [Y] leads sent = Z%
  - Consultation→Retained rate: [X] retained ÷ [Y] consultations = Z%
  - Lead→Retained rate: [X] retained ÷ [Y] leads sent = Z%
  - Average time to contact lead (from lawyer feedback)
  - Most common CoA factors in converted leads
  - Income correlation (do higher income leads convert better?)
- [ ] Identify patterns:
  - Which types of cases converted best?
  - What information was most valuable to lawyers?
  - What red flags predict non-conversion?

**Build Proof Package (4-5 hours):**
- [ ] Create one-page case study PDF:
  - Title: "Child Support Calculator Lead Quality Report: 6-Week Trial Results"
  - Contents: Number of leads generated, conversion metrics, sample lead profile, direct lawyer quotes, cost comparison
- [ ] Get testimonial quotes from validation lawyers:
  - Email: "Thanks for being part of the trial. Would you be comfortable with me using a quote from you when I approach other lawyers?"
  - Aim for 1-2 solid testimonials

**Refine Lead Quality Criteria (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] Update CoA prompt emphasis based on conversion patterns
- [ ] Document "ideal lead profile" for future filtering
- [ ] Identify which CoA reasons correlate with lawyer conversion

**Create Lawyer Pitch Deck (3-4 hours):**
- [ ] Only create this if validation succeeded (15%+ consultation rate)
- [ ] Slides: Problem, Solution, How it works, Trial results, Testimonials, Pricing, Guarantee

**Success Metrics:**
- **If Exclusive Partner:** Ads running, leads flowing, partner satisfied
- **If Validation Only:** 15%+ lead→consultation rate, 2 testimonials, clear ideal customer profile
- Understanding of whether $50/lead pricing is viable or needs adjustment

**Failure Signals:**
- <10% consultation rate = model doesn't work, leads too cold
- No lawyers willing to provide testimonial = they didn't find value
- Wide variance in conversion between lawyers = quality inconsistent

---

### 3A.5 Traffic Reality Check

**Realistic organic traffic (zero budget):**
- Week 1-2: 30-80 sessions
- Week 3-4: 80-150 sessions (Reddit/forum posts gaining traction)
- Week 5-6: 100-200 sessions (SEO starting to kick in)
- Week 7-8: 150-250 sessions
- **Total 6-week traffic: 500-800 sessions**

**Conversion to inquiry form: 2-4%**
- Low end: 500 × 2% = 10 inquiries
- High end: 800 × 4% = 32 inquiries

**Quality filter pass rate (CoA complexity): 40-60%**
- Low end: 10 × 40% = 4 qualified leads
- High end: 32 × 60% = 19 qualified leads

**Realistic outcome: 8-15 qualified leads to distribute**

This is enough to validate if you get 2-3 lawyers on board. Each receives 3-5 leads. If conversion is good, you have proof.

**If Exclusive Partner lands:** Their $500 ads budget generates additional 4-6 leads for them specifically.

---

### 3A.6 When to Spend Your $1000-1500 Budget

**DO NOT spend on Google Ads in Weeks 1-8.**

**Only spend budget if:**
1. Week 8 results show 15%+ consultation rate from organic leads
2. You have 1-2 lawyer testimonials
3. You've identified clear "qualified lead" criteria
4. No Exclusive Partner materialized (otherwise they're funding ads)

**Then allocate in February:**
- $800-1000: Google Ads targeting "child support calculator Australia"
- $200-300: Freelance writer for 3-5 additional SEO blog posts
- $100-200: Paid listings on legal directories

**If Exclusive Partner works:** Don't spend your budget at all. Use their pilot data to sign more partners in February.

---

### 3A.7 Viability Thresholds

**Minimum conversion rates to justify business:**

**Lawyer's math:**
- Pays $50 per lead
- Needs 1 retained client per 5 leads to break even (assuming $3,000 avg case value, 50% profit margin)
- Therefore: 20% lead→retained rate required

**Your math:**
- Lead→consultation: 15% minimum (industry standard)
- Consultation→retained: 50% minimum (typical for family law)
- Combined: 15% × 50% = 7.5% lead→retained rate

**This doesn't work at $50/lead.** Lawyer needs 20%, you're delivering 7.5%.

**To hit viability:**
- Need 40% lead→consultation rate (very high, requires excellent CoA filtering) + 50% retained rate = 20% end-to-end
- Or lower pricing to $25-35 per lead to match 7.5% economics

**Be prepared to discover:**
- $50/lead is too expensive for the conversion rate you achieve
- You need to charge $25-35 to make economics work for lawyers
- Or you need performance pricing (only charge for consultations booked, not leads sent)

---
