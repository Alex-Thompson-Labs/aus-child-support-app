# Australian Child Support Calculator
**B2B Lead Generation for Family Lawyers**

---

## What We Do

**Free child support calculator** at auschildsupport.com that generates qualified legal leads for Australian family law firms.

Parents get instant calculations. Lawyers get ready-to-convert clients. We connect the two and charge $50 per qualified lead.

## The Problem

**For Parents:**
- Child support calculations are confusing and stressful
- Can't afford $300-500 lawyer consultations just to get an estimate
- Need quick answers during separation negotiations

**For Lawyers:**
- Spend hours on "tire-kicker" consultations that don't convert
- Hard to find clients who actually need and can afford legal services
- Generic legal marketing doesn't work - families need trust first

## Our Solution

- Implements official Australian 2024-2025 child support formula
- Detects complex cases: high payment obligations ($15K+/year), disputed care arrangements (35-65%), urgent court dates, Change of Assessment grounds
- Shows instant results - builds trust before asking for contact info

**2. Smart Lead Detection**
