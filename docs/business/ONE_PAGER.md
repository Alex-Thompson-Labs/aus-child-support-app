# Australian Child Support Calculator
**B2B Lead Generation for Family Lawyers**

---

## What We Do

**Free child support calculator** at auschildsupport.com that generates qualified legal leads for Australian family law firms.

Parents get instant calculations. Lawyers get ready-to-convert clients. We connect the two and charge $50 per qualified lead.

---

## The Problem

**For Parents:**
- Child support calculations are confusing and stressful
- Can't afford $300-500 lawyer consultations just to get an estimate
- Need quick answers during separation negotiations

**For Lawyers:**
- Spend hours on "tire-kicker" consultations that don't convert
- Hard to find clients who actually need and can afford legal services
- Generic legal marketing doesn't work - families need trust first

---

## Our Solution

**1. Free Calculator (auschildsupport.com)**
- Implements official Australian 2024-2025 child support formula
- Detects complex cases: high payment obligations ($15K+/year), disputed care arrangements (35-65%), urgent court dates, Change of Assessment grounds
- Shows instant results - builds trust before asking for contact info

**2. Smart Lead Detection**
- Only prompts "Get Legal Help" when complexity detected
- Captures contact details with explicit consent (Privacy Act compliant)
- Stores leads securely in encrypted database

**3. Lawyer Marketplace**
- **Validation Phase (Jan 2025):** Free leads to 2-3 lawyers for feedback, OR Exclusive Partner (firm funds $500 Google Ads, gets exclusive leads)
- **Revenue Phase (Feb 2025+):** Send teaser emails to partner lawyers (case summary without contact details)
- Lawyer responds "interested" → we charge $50 → send full details
- Manual quality control ensures lead quality stays high
