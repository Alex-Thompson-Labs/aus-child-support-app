# 1.1.A.110 Artificial conception


## Definition


A person who is a parent (1.1.P.10) under the FL Act is also considered a parent for the purposes of the CSA Act and applies to children born as a result of an artificial conception procedure.


A woman who gives birth to a child, in Australia or overseas, following an artificial conception procedure is legally a parent of that child. If the child was born to a woman whilst married or in a de facto relationship (either same-sex or opposite-sex) and her partner (1.1.P.20) consented to the procedure, the partner is also a parent of the child. A woman's partner is presumed to consent to the procedure unless it is demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she did not consent.


Prior to 1 July 2009 a same-sex partner of a woman who gave birth to a child born as a result of an artificial conception procedure was not a 'parent'.

# 1.1.A.130 ATI indexation factor


## Definition


TheATI(1.1.A.20) indexation factor is used to calculate a parent's (1.1.P.10) provisional income (1.1.P.130) (3.3) if there is no tax assessment for a parent for the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10) (but a tax return for a previous year of income (1.1.Y.10)). The ATI indexation factor is calculated to 3 decimal places.


The provisional income would be calculated by multiplying the parent's ATI for a previous financial year by the ATI indexation factor.


How the ATI indexation factor (section 58AA) is calculated:

• AWEamount for the December quarter of the last relevant year of income ÷ AWE amount for the December quarter of the tax return year.

Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment for a newCSP(1.1.C.150) from 1 August 2024. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2023–24 and a tax assessment is available for the previous year 2022–23 ($30,000). The AWE amount for:

• 2023-24 is the 2023 amount $1,431.10
• 2022-23 is the 2022 amount of $1,376.60.

The ATI indexation factor is $1,431.10 ÷ $1,376.60 = 1.040.


The ATI indexation factor is calculated with reference to the trend all employees AWE figure for the December quarter (November reference period) published by theABSand is used in the calculation of assessments where required from the following 1 July.


The Australian Statistician temporarily suspended publication of the AWE trend series from May 2020. In consultation with the Australian Statistician, an alternative AWE amount has been determined for this December quarter. Calculations of the ATI indexation factor for CSPs that begin from the following 1 July use the determined amount.


Note:From 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2013, the ATI indexation factor was calculated with reference to the September quarter AWE figure (August reference period). Due to changes in the frequency of AWE publications, the December quarter (November reference period) AWE figure is used to calculate the ATI indexation factor for all CSPs commencing from 1 July 2013.

## Definition


A binding child support agreement is a written agreement between parents (1.1.P.10) (and/or a non-parent carer on the amount of child support (1.1.C.60) to be paid, and how it will be paid.


Each party to the binding child support agreement must have received independent legal advice before entering into the agreement. Binding child support agreements operate in a similar manner to financial agreements that separating parents might make in relation to property, superannuation and spousal maintenance.

# 1.1.C.10 Care


## Definition


Care is not defined in the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation. For child support purposes, care is generally determined based on the amount of overnight care a parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer has provided or is likely to provide for a child over a care period (usually 12 months). However, a broad range of factors can be used to determine care depending on the circumstances of the individual case.


The child support formula (1.1.C.110) recognises how much care a parent or non-parent carer has of a child through the percentage of care (1.1.P.70) which is used to calculate the cost percentage (1.1.C.200).


A parent's percentage of care for a child will change when the care arrangements change, with some exceptions.

# 1.1.C.130 Child support inflation factor


## Definition


Prior to 1 July 2011, the CSA Act provided for an inflation factor, known as the child support inflation factor, to determine incomes to be used in assessments where a parent (1.1.P.10) did not lodge a tax return for the relevant year of income but lodged a tax return for the previous year of income.


Some child support agreements or court orders still specify that the child support inflation factor be used as the indexation value for that agreement or order. These orders and agreements continue to use the inflation factor as per the previous methodology in the CSA Act. Due to a change to theABS' publication frequency ofAWE, from 2013 the child support inflation factor generally refers to the trend AWE figure of the relevant June quarter for child support agreement and court order purposes.


Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, the ABS temporarily suspended publication of the AWE trend series from May 2020. As a result, the 2021 and 2022 child support inflation factors were calculated with reference to the 12-month period to the December quarter 2019. The 2023 child support inflation factor was calculated with reference to the 12-month period to the June quarter 2022.

# 1.1.C.140 Child support percentage


## Definition


A parent's (1.1.P.10) child support percentage is calculated for each child in the assessment and identifies which parent in an assessment is required to pay child support (1.1.C.60). The child support percentage is calculated as follows:

• Child support percentage = income percentage (1.1.I.30) – cost percentage (1.1.C.200)

If a parent's child support percentage for a child is positive, they are not meeting their share of theCOTC(1.1.C.210) (based on their share of the income) through care (1.1.C.10) and may be liable to pay child support for that child. A parent is not required to pay child support if they have more than 65% care of a child.


If a parent's child support percentage for a child is negative, they are meeting more than their share of the COTC through care. They may be entitled to receive child support for that child.


A parent can have different child support percentages for each child in an assessment if the care arrangement for each child is different. In this situation, the child support liability for each child is calculated, and the parent with the net liability will be required to pay child support.


If a non-parent carers is an eligible carer (1.1.E.10)(has at least shared care (1.1.S.40) they may be eligible for child support and will not have a child support percentage calculated because their income is not used in child support assessments (1.1.C.70). If there is more than one carer for a child, a non-parent carer's cost percentage (1.1.C.200) can be used to distribute child support between the carers. See2.2.3for information about assessments with non-parent carers.

# 1.1.C.150 Child support period


## Definition


ACSPis a period of time to which a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) applies.


Each child support assessment applies to a separate CSP. A CSP is a flexible period of time, which cannot exceed 15 months. The length of the CSP for any assessment will vary according to the individual circumstances of the child support case (1.1.C.80) which determines both the start and end date of the CSP.


The rate of child support (1.1.C.60) may change during the CSP as the assessment may be amended to replace default incomes or to take account of various changes such as changes in the care of children, the ages of the children, or the application of an income estimate (1.1.I.20). These amendments may apply to the whole CSP or just part of the CSP, depending upon the nature of the change, when it occurred, and when the Registrar was advised of the change.

# 1.1.C.170 Child support years (pre 1 July 1999)


## Definition


CSP(1.1.C.150) were introduced from 1 July 1999. Before then, the Registrar made assessments that applied to child support years. Child support years were aligned with the financial year and ran from 1 July to 30 June.


The 'last relevant year of income' (1.1.L.10) for a child support year was the financial year 2 years before the child support year. In most cases, this was the most recent income tax assessment available when the Registrar made a new assessment. For instance, the last relevant year of income for the 1998-99 child support year was the 1996-97 financial year.


While child support assessments (1.1.C.70) applied to separate child support years, this did not mean the rate of child support (1.1.C.60)stayed the same for the whole year. The assessment could be amended to replace default incomes (1.1.D.20) or to take into account various changes, such as relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60), changes in levels of care (1.1.C.10) or income estimates (1.1.I.20). Some amendments applied retrospectively to the whole of the child support year (for example, changes to the parent's (1.1.P.10) child support income (1.1.C.120) arising from estimates of income or replacement of default incomes). Other amendments applied from the date of the change in circumstances, no matter when the parents advised the Registrar of that change (for example, new relevant dependent children and changes in levels of care).


## Transitional arrangements for cases with liabilities that commenced on or before 1 July 1999


Transitional arrangements applied to child support cases (1.1.C.80) with liabilities that started on or before 1 July 1999. For these cases the last assessment under the old 'child support year' (1.1.C.170) arrangements ended on 30 June 1999. The Registrar made a new assessment under the CSP arrangements to apply to a CSP starting 1 July 1999 and ending 30 September 2000.


The transitional provisions contained a special definition of the 'last relevant year of income'. Assessments for the CSP commencing 1 July 1999 are based upon parents' income for the financial year 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 (1997-98) increased by an inflation factor.


The transitional provisions also required the Registrar to make a new assessment for these cases when either parent's 1998-99 income tax assessments issued. Up to and including 31 May 2000, the Registrar made a new assessment if:

• the payer's (1.1.P.40) 1998-99 income tax assessment issued and the Registrar had not made a new assessment because the payee's (1.1.P.30) income tax assessment has previously issued, or
• the payee's 1998-99 income tax assessment issued, the payee's income could affect the rate of child support payable and the Registrar had not already made an assessment based on the payer's 1998-99 income.

## WA ex-nuptial children cases


The pre-July 1999 rules continued to apply up to and including 31 December 2000 to cases where the payee and child resided in WA and the payer and payee had never married each other (WA ex-nuptial cases). Special transitional arrangements applied to those cases.


The Registrar made new assessments of child support for WA ex-nuptial cases to apply to a 15-month CSP commencing on 1 January 2001. The last relevant year of income for these assessments was 1999 to 2000.


Special arrangements apply to WA ex-nuptial cases where theATOhad assessed neither parent's 1999-00 taxable income before 16 December 2000. For those cases, the assessment for the CSP that started on 1 January 2001 was based upon the parents' 1998-99 taxable income (1.1.T.20). The Registrar made a new administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) if the ATO issued the payer's income tax assessment for the 1999-00 year before 15 June 2001. If the ATO issued the payee's income tax assessment for the 1999-00 year before 15 June 2001, and before the payer's income tax assessment, the Registrar made a new administrative assessment as long as the payee's income would affect the rate of child support. These assessments applied to a new CSP commencing on the first day of the month following the Registrar's assessment.

# 1.1.C.180 Collection agency maintenance liability


## Definition


Before the child support (1.1.C.60) scheme was established, there were different arrangements in each Australian state and territory for collection of maintenance. Where a state or territory collection agency was responsible for collecting a person's liability to pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) of maintenance for their step-child, child, spouse or former spouse (but not a de facto spouse), that liability meets the definition of a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40). A collection agency maintenance liability does not have to arise under a court order.


In relation to a state or territory, a collection agency maintenance liability means a liability:

• that is a liability ofa parent (1.1.P.10) of a child to pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) for the maintenance of the childa step-parent of a child to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the child, ora party to a de facto relationship to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the other part to the de facto relationship, whether or not the liability arises under a court order or court registered maintenance agreement, and
• a parent (1.1.P.10) of a child to pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) for the maintenance of the child
• a step-parent of a child to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the child, or
• a party to a de facto relationship to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the other part to the de facto relationship, whether or not the liability arises under a court order or court registered maintenance agreement, and
• in relation to which collection nor recovery action is being conducted by or under the control or supervision of, established under the law of the state or territory.

The CSRC Act provides for a collection agency maintenance liability to be a registrable maintenance liability.

## Definition


A carer debt is a debt due to the Commonwealth in relation to an overpayment (1.1.O.20) of a registered maintenance liability.


A carer liability is a type of liability under the CSRC Act that relates to a carer debt. A carer liability can be enforced by the Child Support Registrar in a similar way to registered maintenance liabilities.


Generally, the payer (1.1.P.40) of a carer liability is the payee (1.1.P.30) of the relevant registered maintenance liability and the payee of a carer liability is the payer of the registered maintenance liability.


For further information refer to the definition for overpayments.

# 1.1.C.210 Costs of the child


## Definition


A particular object of the CSA Act is that the level of financial support to be provided by parents (1.1.P.10) for their children should be determined in accordance with theCOTC.


The COTC Table (2.3.1.20) calculates the COTC for:

• the costs for a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) amount
• the multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50), and
• the COTC support children in the assessment.

The COTC for the relevant dependent child amount and/or multi-case child costs is calculated to ensure a parent’s financial responsibility to support other children is recognised when their child support income (1.1.C.120) is calculated. The costs are calculated based on the income of the parent, and the number and ages of the relevant children.


The COTC for the child support children in the assessment is calculated to determine how the costs of each child in a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) will be shared by both parents (either by care (1.1.C.10) and/or the payment of child support). The costs are calculated based on the combined income of the parents (Formula 1 to 4) or the income of one parent if the other parent’s income is not available (Formula 5 and 6). The costs are also based on the number and age of the children.

# 1.1.C.200 Cost percentage


## Definition


The cost percentage is used by the child support formula (1.1.C.110) to determine how much of the costs of a child, a parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer is meeting through care.


A cost percentage is calculated for each child in an assessment (because the care arrangement for each child must be recognised). The cost percentage is used to calculate the child support percentage (1.1.C.140).


The cost percentage is determined according to the person's percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for a child, using the cost percentage table.

• A percentage of care of 11% equates to a cost percentage of 0%.
• A percentage of care of 19% equates to a cost percentage of 24%.
• A percentage of care of 40% equates to a cost percentage of 35%.
• A percentage of care of 50% equates to a cost percentage of 50%.
• A percentage of care of 60% equates to a cost percentage of 65%.
• A percentage of care of 81% equates to a cost percentage of 76%.
• A percentage of care of 88% equates to a cost percentage of 100%.

# 1.1.C.90 Child support debt


## Definition


A child support debt is an amount due to the Commonwealth under a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) that is registered for collection under the CSRC Act.


When a registrable maintenance liability is registered for collection under the CSRC Act, the particulars of the liability are entered into the Child Support Register (1.2.1.10). Some of the particulars that get entered into the Register determine when the amounts are payable to the Commonwealth.


Where a liability to pay periodic amounts (1.1.P.80) is to be registered, the periodic amounts must be converted into a rate of payment in respect of a payment period (1.1.P.50). Amounts are payable to the Commonwealth based on the payment rate for the payment period. The payment period for a liability will vary based on the type of liability and the method of collection (for example, employer withholding (1.1.E.20) or voluntary payments) and this will affect when an amount becomes a debt due to the Commonwealth.


There may also be an initial period that is entered into the Register when the liability is registered. The initial period is the period between when the liability first becomes enforceable and when the first payment period commences.


Unpaid amounts owing to a person under a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) from a private collect (1.1.P.110) period are not child support debts owed to the Commonwealth. A person entitled to amounts under a child support assessment in a private collect arrangement can take action to recover amounts owing to them, including by suing for and recovering those amounts in a court.


Note:Subject to certain conditions and time limits, an application can be made for the enforcement of arrears relating to a private collect period where the liability arises under a child support assessment.

# 1.1.E.10 Eligible carer


## Definition


An eligible carer is a person who has at least 35% care (1.1.C.10) of the child.


Example:Vikram has 2 children Shashi and Jaya. Shashi lives with Vikram all the time. Jaya stays with Vikram 2 nights a week. Vikram is an eligible carer of Shashi, as Vikram has a care percentage (1.1.C.20) of 100% for Shashi. Vikram is not an eligible carer of Jaya because Vikram has less than shared care (1.1.S.40), as Vikram has a care percentage of 28% (2 nights × 52 weeks ÷ 365 = 28).


A non-parent carer (not a parent (1.1.P.10) or legal guardian) can apply for an assessment (2.1.1) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable by the parents of the child if they have at least shared care (1.1.S.40) of the child. If the parent or legal guardian of the child has not indicated their consent for the person to care for the child, the person is not an eligible carer unless it is unreasonable for the parent or legal guardian to care for the child.


The Registrar will deem it is unreasonable for a parent or guardian to care for the child if:

• there has been extreme family breakdown, or
• there is a serious risk to the child's physical or mental wellbeing from violence or sexual abuse in the home of the parent or legal guardian concerned.

If a parent or legal guardian advises the Registrar that they do not consent to the applicant providing care for the child, Services Australia will investigate to establish whether the applicant satisfies the requirements for an eligible carer.


The terms of the legislation imply that if the parent does not agree to the care arrangements they must be prepared to provide care for the child. Some reasonable indication of an alternative living arrangement for the child is required.


## Extreme family breakdown


The Registrar will be satisfied that there has been an extreme family breakdown if:

• the child has never lived with the parent
• there has been a substantial period since the parent has provided care for the child, or
• other circumstances indicate extreme family breakdown.

However, the Registrar is unlikely to be satisfied that there has been an extreme family breakdown if the parent has had frequent and regular contact with the child over a substantial part of the period when another person provided care for the child.


The Registrar may seek evidence of extreme family breakdown.


## Serious risk to child's physical or mental wellbeing


When determining whether there is a serious risk to the child's mental or physical wellbeing as a result of violence or sexual abuse in the home of the parent or legal guardian, the individual circumstances of each case, including any evidence provided, will be considered. Examples of evidence that may assist to substantiate a claim of serious risk of violence/abuse to the child include, but is not limited to, police reports/statements, apprehended violence orders, domestic violence orders, medical reports, or applications for a restraining order.


## Effect of a court order about the child's care


If a court has ordered that the child reside with the non-parent carer, Services Australia will generally not look beyond the order. If a court order says that the child will reside with one of their parents and that parent tells the Registrar they do not consent to the child living with the non-parent carer, the Registrar will presume that the non-parent carer is not an eligible carer unless they can provide evidence that there has been extreme family breakdown or that there is a serious risk to the child's physical or mental wellbeing as described above.

## Definition


Child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are generally based on both parents’ (1.1.P.10)ATIfrom the last relevant financial year and the level of care (1.1.C.10) they provide for their children. If a parent’s income has reduced by 15% or more from the income used in their assessment, they can elect for their assessment to be based on an estimate of their current income. An income estimate is reconciled after the financial year with the parent’s actual income.

# 1.1.I.10 Income amount order


## Definition


An income amount order means:

• a departure order made by a court or change of assessment (Part 5), (1.1.C.50) that eithersets the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable in a child support case (1.1.C.80), orsets theATI(3.1.1), (1.1.A.20), or the child support income (3.1), (1.1.C.120), of a parent (1.1.P.10)
• sets the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable in a child support case (1.1.C.80), or
• sets theATI(3.1.1), (1.1.A.20), or the child support income (3.1), (1.1.C.120), of a parent (1.1.P.10)
• provisions of a child support agreement (Part 6) that have effect as if they were an income amount order made by consent. That is, the provisions of the agreement set the annual rate of child support payable, the ATI, or the child support income of a parent.

An income amount order can relate to only one parent or to both parents and if it is only in relation to one parent it will not prevent the other parent from making an income estimate (3.4), (1.1.I.20) election.


An income amount order is not:

• an agreement that provides for the payment of child support other than in the form of a periodic amount (1.1.P.80)
• an order, agreement or change of assessment decision that varies a parent's child support percentage (1.1.C.140), self-support amount (1.1.S.20), relevant dependent allowance (1.1.R.60) multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30), cost percentage (1.1.C.200), or theCOTC(1.1.C.210).

If a child support agreement is suspended because the payee (1.1.P.30) is no longer an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) of the child (CSA Act section 86), an income amount order is no longer considered to be in force during the period of suspension. A parent is not prevented from making an income estimate in relation to a formula assessment (1.1.F.20) that may take effect during the suspension period (CSA Act section 60(6)).


Example:Sebastian and Ina's child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is based on a court ordered departure order which sets Sebastian's ATI amount at $56,000. This is an income amount order for Sebastian only. Ina can still make an income estimate election.


Example:Jack and Rochelle's child support assessment is based on a change of assessment decision which increases the annual rate payable by Jack by $5,000. As the change of assessment decision does not set the annual rate payable, it is not an income amount order.


Example:Michelle and Owen enter into a child support agreement for their child, Amanda. The agreement states that Michelle will pay Amanda's school fees and the costs of all school excursions and uniforms. It states that an annual amount of $8,000 is to be credited against Michelle's child support liability.


Michelle applies to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement. The Registrar accepts the agreement and starts a newCSP(1.1.C.150) reducing the annual amount that Michelle pays Owen by $8,000. The child support assessment is based on Michelle's ATI for the last relevant year, namely $72,000. Three months later, Michelle's income has reduced. Michelle contacts Services Australia and advises that her current annual ATI is $50,000. Michelle is able to make an income estimate election. The child support agreement is an agreement for the payment of child support by non-periodic payments to the other parent. The provisions of the agreement are not an income amount order.


Example:Ethan and Janine's child support assessment is based on a change of assessment decision. Ethan's relevant dependent child allowance was increased to take into account the special needs of Ethan's relevant dependent child. The change of assessment decision is not an income amount order.

# 1.1.I.50 Interim care period


## Definition


An interim care period is where, in relation to a particular child, the care percentages (1.1.C.20) used in the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) correspond with the care under an applicable written care arrangement for a limited length of time, rather than the actual care.


Interim care periods are available in certain circumstances where a person with reduced care in comparison to their level of care under a written care arrangement is taking reasonable action to have the arrangement complied with.


Several factors determine the duration of an interim period including the type of written care arrangement, when the arrangement was made and the actions of the person with increased care.


See2.2.4for further information.

## Definition


The income percentage indicates the share of the costs of a child each parent (1.1.P.10) is responsible for meeting.

Where both parents (1.1.P.10) in a child support case (1.1.C.80) are assessed as liable to pay child support to the other for different children, the amounts payable by each parent will be offset. This means there will only be one annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable in a child support case.


Example:Siddhi is liable to pay Paul $5,000 for child Zac. Paul is liable to pay $10,000 to Siddhi for child Rebecca. These liabilities are offset. This means that in the child support case involving Siddhi and Paul, Paul is liable to pay Siddhi an annual rate of $5,000.

# 1.1.L.40 Limited child support agreement


## Definition


A limited child support agreement is a type of child support agreement where the parties decide on the rate of child support (1.1.C.60) and how it is to be provided.


There must be an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) in place for the relevant children before a limited child support agreement can be accepted by the Registrar. The rate of child support payable under a limited child support agreement cannot be less than the rate payable under the relevant administrative assessment on the day the agreement is submitted for acceptance.


A limited child support agreement can be accepted by the Child Support Registrar without the need for the parties to seek independent legal advice.

# 1.1.L.50 Lump sum order


## Definition


A court can make an order for a parent (1.1.P.10) to provide child support (1.1.C.60) to a carer entitled to child support in the form of a lump sum payment (1.1.L.60) to be credited against the relevant child support assessment (1.1.C.70) if:

• the liable parent (1.1.L.30) or carer entitled to child support makes an application to a court with jurisdiction under the CSA Act
• the court is satisfied that it would be just and equitable and otherwise proper, in regard to the child, the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support to make such an order
• the amount of the lump sum payment equals or exceeds the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable for the child under the child support assessment.

Note:If the court makes such an order, the lump sum payment is credited under section 69A of the CSRC Act against the amount payable under the payer’s liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the child support assessment).


A lump sum order can include a payment made by way of transfer or settlement of property. A lump sum order must specify:

• the amount of the lump sum payment
• the lump sum payment is to be credited against 100%, or another specified percentage that is less than 100% of the amounts payable under the child support assessment.

In determining the application made, the court must have regard to:

• the child support assessment
• any departure determinations or orders that may be in force in relation to the child or both parents (or non-parent carer entitled to child support)
• if the person entitled to child support is in receipt of an income tested pension, allowance or benefit
• if the person entitled to child support is not in receipt of such a pension, allowance or benefit – if the effect of the proposed lump sum order (1.1.L.50) would mean the person would not be able to support themselves without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.

The court must consider whether the proposed lump sum order is just and equitable (see factors outlined in5.3). The court must consider if the proposed lump sum order is otherwise proper (see factors outlined in5.4).


A binding child support agreement may include lump sum payment provisions. See6.1for further information.

# 1.1.L.60 Lump sum payment provisions


## Definition


The lump sum payment provisions are a way in which child support (1.1.C.60) may be provided under a child support agreement through a lump sum payment (including by way of transfer or settlement of property). An agreement with lump sum payment provisions must be a binding child support agreement (1.1.B.30).


The lump sum payment provisions operate in a similar way to lump sum orders (1.1.L.50). There must be an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) in force for the relevant child and the lump sum amount must equal or exceed the amount payable under that assessment.


If a lump sum amount in a child support agreement does meet the requirements of the lump sum payment provisions, then it can only be included in the agreement if it meets any of the other types of payment provisions that may be included in agreements.


Where an agreement contains lump sum payment provisions, the lump sum amount is credited against the amount payable under the liability.

# 1.1.M.40 Multi-case cap


## Definition


The multi-case cap is calculated on a per child basis and ensures a paying parent (1.1.P.10) with multiple child support cases (1.1.C.80) does not pay more child support (1.1.C.60) for a child than they would if all the children lived in the same household. The cap recognises that the parent may be bearing some of the costs of a child directly through regular or shared care (1.1.R.50) (1.1.S.40) and is adjusted accordingly.


The multi-case cap for each child is the multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50) for the child, multiplied by the costs that the parent does not meet directly through care (1.1.C.10). The methodology to calculate the multi-case cap is below.

• multi-case child costs x (100% − cost percentage) (1.1.C.200)

Example:Amari has 3 children and 2 child support cases. In case 1, child support needs to be assessed for Soraya aged 15, and Estelle aged 12. In case 2, child support needs to be assessed for Leigh aged 6. Amari hasATI(1.1.A.20) of $80,000. The multi case child costs for Amari are $5,468 for Soraya and $4,609 each for Estelle and Leigh.

• Soraya = Amari’s cost percentage is 0% multi-case cap= $5,468 x (100%-0%)= $5,468
• Estelle = Amari’s cost percentage is 0% multi-case cap= $4,609 x (100%-0%)= $4,609
• Leigh = Amari’s cost percentage is 0% multi-case cap= $4,609 x (100%-0%)= $4,609

# 1.1.M.10 Member of a couple


## Definition


A member of a couple for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes means:

• a person who is legally married and living with this person on a permanent basis
• a person who is not legally married but is living on a permanent basis with another person in a genuine domestic relationship, or
• a person whose relationship with another person (whether of the same sex or a different sex) is registered under a law of a state or territory as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section and is not living separately and apart from the other person on a permanent or indefinite basis.

See SS Guide2.2.5.30for information on the factors in establishing whether people are living together as partners on a genuine domestic basis.


A person cannot live with another person as their partner on a genuine domestic basis if they are aged under 16 years. This is because a person is living with another person as their partner on a genuine domestic basis if the relationship has the characteristics of marriage(FO v HAF[2006] QCA 555;Re Kennison and Secretary, Department of Social Security(1985) 8 ALD 560). To have the characteristics of marriage, the persons must be at least 16 years old, which refers to a person's capacity to marry pursuant to theMarriage Act 1961(Cth).

# 1.1.N.10 Non-periodic payment provisions


## Definition


Non-periodic payment provisions are a specific way in which child support (1.1.C.60) may be provided under a child support agreement.


A child support agreement with non-periodic payment provisions must specify how those amounts are to reduce the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable for the child. The ways in which the annual rate of child support payable for a child can be reduced by the non-periodic payment provisions are set out in the CSA Act.


For example, an agreement with non-periodic payment provisions may provide for the liable party to pay school fees directly to a school for the benefit of the child, and that those amounts will reduce the annual rate payable under the relevant administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) by a specific amount.


If a child support agreement does not specify how non-periodic amounts will reduce the rate of child support payable under the relevant administrative assessment, then they are not amounts under the non-periodic payment provisions and can only be accepted in the agreement if they meet any of the other provisions that may be included in agreements.

# 1.1.M.30 Multi-case allowance


## Definition


The multi-case allowance is a component of child support income (3.1) (1.1.C.120) which is deducted from a parent's (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20) when they have more than one child support case (1.1.C.80). The multi-case allowance recognises the parent’s responsibility to financially support a child or children in another child support case.


The multi-case allowance is the sum of the multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50), excluding theCOTCof the case to which the assessment relates.


Example:In 2024, Amari has 3 children and 2 child support cases. In case 1, child support needs to be assessed for Soraya aged 15, and Estelle aged 12. In case 2, child support needs to be assessed for Leigh aged 6. Amari has ATI of $80,000.


Calculate child support income

• ATI less:self-support amount (1.1.S.20)relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) amount
• ATI of $80,000 −self-support amount ($28,463)relevant dependent child amount (not applicable)

CHILD SUPPORT INCOME$80,000 − $28,463= $51,537


For each child, find what all the children would cost if they were all the same age

• use the parent’s child support income
• use the COTC Table
• Costs of Soraya (15 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 13+($51,537 − $42,695) x 31% + $13,662= $16,403
• Costs of Estelle (12 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 0 to 12($51,537 − $42,695) x 26% + $11,528= $13,827
• Costs of Leigh (6 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 0 to 12($51,537 − $42,695) x 26% + $11,528= $13,827
• Soraya’s multi case child costs$16,403 ÷ 3 = $5,468
• Estelle’s multi case child costs$13,827 ÷ 3 = $4,609
• Leigh’s multi case child costs$13,827 ÷ 3 = $4,609

Leigh’s multi-case child costs = $4,609


Case 1 – multi-case allowance = $4,609

• Amari’s child support income$51,537 − $4,609= $46,928

Soraya’s multi-case child costs = $5,468


Estelle’s multi-case child costs = $4,609


TOTAL MULTI-CASE CHILD COSTS$5,468 + $4,609 = $10,077


Case 2 – multi-case allowance = $10,077

• Amari’s child support income$51,537 − $10,077= $41,460

# 1.1.M.50 Multi-case child costs


## Definition


Multi-case child costs are used to calculate the multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) and the multi-case cap (1.1.M.40). The multi-case child costs are the costs of each of a parent’s (1.1.P.10) child support (1.1.C.60) children (in all of their child support cases (1.1.C.80)) based on the parent’s income only.


The multi-case cost of each child is calculated as if all the child support children were the same age as that child. To work out this cost:

• work out the total number of the parent's child support children
• look up the parent's (individual) income and the age of the child on the relevantCOTC(1.1.C.210) Table (2.3.1.20) to find what all the children would cost if they were all the same age
• divide this amount by the total number of the parent's child support children.

Example:In 2024, Amari has 3 children and 2 child support cases. In case 1, child support needs to be assessed for Soraya aged 15, and Estelle aged 12. In case 2, child support needs to be assessed for Leigh aged 6. Amari hasATI(1.1.A.20) of $80,000 and child support income (1.1.C.120) of $51,537 for the purposes of calculating multi-case child costs (ATI less self-support amount).


Calculate child support income

• ATI less:self-support amount (1.1.S.20)relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) amount
• ATI of $80,000 −self-support amount ($28,463)relevant dependent child amount (not applicable)

CHILD SUPPORT INCOME$80,000 − $28,463= $51,537


For each child, find what all the children would cost if they were all the same age

• use the parent’s child support income
• use the COTC Table (2024)
• Costs of Soraya (15 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 13+($51,537 − $42,695) x 31% + $13,662= $16,403
• Costs of Estelle (12 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 0 to 12($51,537 − $42,695) x 26% + $11,528= $13,827
• Costs of Leigh (6 years old)Costs for 3 children aged 0 to 12($51,537 − $42,695) x 26% + $11,528= $13,827
• Soraya’s multi case child costs$16,403 ÷ 3 = $5,468

## Definition


In most circumstances a parent (1.1.P.10) liable to pay child support (1.1.C.60) in a case is required to pay at least theMAR. The MAR exists to reinforce the principle that all parents must contribute to the financial support of their children.


A MAR of child support is payable when:

• the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) works out to less than the minimum rate, or
• a parent does not have at least regular care (1.1.R.50) of any of the children in the child support assessment, and

A notional assessment is the child support (1.1.C.60) amount that would be payable under a child support administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) if a child support agreement was not in place.


A notional assessment will apply to all child support agreements (other than lump sum payment provisions (1.1.L.60)), where the application for acceptance is received by the Registrar on or after 1 July 2008.


The notional assessment amount is used when determining the relevant amount ofFTBPart A payable (FA Guide1.1.N.45) to a payee (1.1.P.30).

# 1.1.P.120 Protected earnings


## Definition


When employer withholding (1.1.E.20) is in place, protected earnings is the amount of income an employer is required to leave a payer (1.1.P.40) with after they have deducted child support (1.1.C.60) from their salary or wage. Protected earnings is deducted from a parent’s (1.1.P.10) salary or wage after taxation. In circumstances where the payer would be left with less that the protected earnings amount an employer should not deduct the full specified amount of the periodic deduction from an employee’s salary or wage.


The protected earnings rate is a weekly rate prescribed by regulation. The weekly rate is prescribed as 75% of the maximum fortnightly basic rate ofJSPpayable on 1 January each year, to a person who has turned 21 years of age and is partnered, with no dependent children. The protected earnings rate is used to calculate the amount of the deductions for salary or wage payments made in each respective calendar year.


Example:In March 2022, Anna earns $500.00 a week and pays tax of $33.00 a week. Anna's employer is required to deduct child support of $60.00 a week. Anna is paid after-tax wages of $467.00 a week. The protected earnings rate at 1 January 2022 is $429.98. To deduct $60.00 in child support would leave Anna with less than the protected earnings rate. For that week, Anna's employer can only deduct $37.02 ($467.00 less $429.98).


The protected earnings amount for recent years is:

# 1.1.P.110 Private collect


## Definition


In a private collect arrangement Services Australia is responsible for assessing the amount of child support (1.1.C.60) that is payable for a child support case (1.1.C.80), but is not responsible for collecting and transferring the amount of child support. Instead, the transfer of child support is managed privately between the parties.


Most commonly, a private collect period applies to a liability arising from a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) that has:

• not been registered for collection under the CSRC Act, or
• has been registered for collection under the CSRC Act but relating to a period where an election has been made for the registered liability to not be enforced under the CSRC Act.

The person entitled to receive child support under a child support assessment during a private collect period has the right to sue for and recover amounts owing to them in court.


The payee (1.1.P.30) of a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) in a private collect period may apply to have the liability registered under the CSRC Act. If the liability has previously been registered and an election was made for the liability to not be enforced, the payee may apply to have the liability again be enforceable. They may also ask for arrears (1.1.A.100) to be collected (7.3.2).

# 1.1.P.130 Provisional income


## Definition


Provisional incomes may be used in a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) to ensure a parent’s (1.1.P.10) financial capacity is reflected as accurately as possible when a parent has not yet lodged a tax return for a relevant financial year.

• ensure child support assessments are accurate despite a parent not lodging a tax return
• encourage timely lodgement of tax returns
• recognise that due dates for tax lodgement due dates can be delayed if the parent lodges their tax return through a tax agent
• minimise the risk of either parent being assessed with a debt or overpayment (1.1.O.20) when a child support assessment is retrospectively updated when the parent lodges their tax return.

A provisional income may be updated retrospectively if new information is received about a parent’s taxable income depending on the period the income will apply to.


For more information on how a provisional income is used in a child support assessment see3.3.1.

# 1.1.P.140 Provisional notional assessment


## Definition


A provisional notional assessment is the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) that would be payable for a child for a particular day in aCSP(1.1.C.150) if that annual rate were payable under an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30).


The provisional notional assessment is calculated using both parents' (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20) and the most recent care (1.1.C.10) details of the child. It will also take into account any relevant change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision and also any departure order made by a court. If the assessment is based on a parent's estimate of income (1.1.I.20), the estimate is disregarded, and the provisional notional assessment will use the parent's ATI for the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10) for the child support period.


If a provisional notional assessment does not reflect a parent’s circumstances, they may seek a variation within 14 days of receiving the written notice. After 14 days a provisional notional assessment will become a notional assessment (1.1.N.20).


For more information refer to6.3.

# 1.1.P.50 Payment period


## Definition


A payment period is the period at which amounts under a registered maintenance liability are payable.


When the Registrar registers a periodic liability arising under a court order or court registered maintenance agreement, a daily rate payable under that maintenance liability must be calculated. Depending on the payment period, a weekly, fortnightly, 4-weekly or monthly rate must also be calculated.


When registering a liability arising under a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), the Registrar must calculate a weekly, fortnightly, 4-weekly or monthly rate of payment based on the daily rate of child support (1.1.C.60) under the assessment. Child support debt (1.1.C.90) will accrue at particular times, depending on the payment period.


The payment period for a registered maintenance liability will depend on how the liability is collected and the circumstances of the payer (1.1.P.40).


Note:This definition does not apply to the term 'payment period' where it appears in section 76 of the CSRC Act, which deals with the entitlement of payees (1.1.P.30) to receive collected amounts.

## Definition


The pension parenting payment (PP) (single) maximum basic amount is used as a measure of whether a person is assessed to pay the fixed annual rate (1.1.F.10) of child support (1.1.C.60). A description of PP is available at SS Guide1.2.4.10.


The pension PP (single) maximum basic amount is the sum of:

• maximum basic rate of PP (single) – the amount that would have been a person’s maximum basic rate under Module B of the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator if the person was receiving PP under the SSAct, and
• basic pension supplement (single) - the amount that would have been the person’s pension supplement under Module BA of the Pension PP (Single) Rate Calculator if the person was receiving PP under that Act.

This figure is calculated on an annual basis on 1 January.

# 1.1.P.70 Percentage of care


## Definition


The percentage of care is used in the child support formula (1.1.C.110) to take into account the amount of time a parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer is responsible for providing care for the child.


A parent's or non-parent carer's care percentage (1.1.C.20) is the percentage of care of the child the person is likely to have over the care period. A care period is generally a 12-month period, but may be shorter or longer than this in some circumstances.


A person's percentage of care for a child will generally be determined according to the actual care that they have of the child. The actual care may be reflected in care arrangements agreed upon by the parents, including non-parent carers. This agreement might take the form of a written agreement, parenting plan or court order in relation to a child's care.


In limited circumstances where care is disputed (4.2), a person's percentage of care for both child support (1.1.C.60) andFTBpurposes may be determined according to a written agreement, parenting plan or court order for an interim period (4.2), rather than being based on actual care.

# 1.1.R.10 Reciprocating jurisdictions


## Definition


A reciprocating jurisdiction is a foreign country; or a part of a foreign country, that is prescribed by the regulations to be a reciprocating jurisdiction.


If a country is a reciprocating jurisdiction the Registrar can:

• make and continue a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) where the payer (1.1.P.40) resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction, provided that the other parent (1.1.P.10) is a resident of Australia
• accept an application for assessment from a payee (1.1.P.30) or payer (1.1.P.40) overseas when transmitted through the overseas central authority (1.1.O.30)
• accept an application for assessment from an overseas central authority applying on behalf of a payee in a reciprocating jurisdiction
• accept an application for assessment made directly by the payer who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction
• register and enforce an overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) made in a reciprocating jurisdiction and/or arrears (1.1.A.100) that have accrued from the liability
• transmit a request for enforcement of a registered maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) to a reciprocating jurisdiction, either upon application by the payee or at the Registrar's initiative
• transmit an application for review/variation of a liability made in an overseas country, and
• assist overseas authorities (1.5.1) with location and service requests for parents in Australia.

The below table lists reciprocating jurisdictions.


*These are excluded jurisdictions for the purposes of making or continuing a child support assessment where the payee is in Australia but the payer resides in that jurisdiction. A court order under theFL Actis still required.

# 1.1.R.70 Reportable fringe benefits total


## Definition


A parent's reportable fringe benefits total is a component ofATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20), and is the amount of reportable fringe benefits as defined in theFringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986for the year of income (1.1.Y.10).


A fringe benefit is a benefit that is provided to an employee or an associate of the employee (such as a family member) as part of the employment arrangement. An employee can be a current, future or former employee. The term benefit is broad and includes any right, privilege, service or facility.


Common examples of fringe benefits provided from employment are:

• provision of a car, house or equipment for private purposes
• a novated lease for purchase of a motor vehicle
• giving somebody ownership of something, for example, items of clothing
• permitting somebody to enjoy a privilege or facility, for example, a discounted loan or discounted airfares, and
• provision of a service, for example, use of skill or labour.

Income derived by the provision of a fringe benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act is exempt income and is not taxable income (1.1.T.20) (Income Tax Assessment Act 1936section 23L). An employer has to pay tax on the taxable value of a fringe benefit. The taxable value of a fringe benefit is usually reduced by the amount of any payment by the recipient or employee towards the fringe benefit. There are specific valuation rules for each category of a fringe benefit (Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act Part III).


Employers are required to report on an employee's payment summary all fringe benefits with a total taxable value of more than $2,000 a year (Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act section 135P). The total taxable value means the amount that the employer paid or assigned as the value of the benefit. However, the grossed up taxable value (which is the total taxable value as determined by the employer multiplied by a figure pre-determined by theATO) will appear on the employee's payment summary. The grossed up taxable value is known as the 'reportable fringe benefits' amount.

# 1.1.R.60 Relevant dependent child


## Definition


A parent's (1.1.P.10) relevant dependent child is:

• a biological child
• an adopted child
• a child born as a result of an artificial conception (1.1.A.110) procedure
• a child born under surrogacy arrangements
• in certain limited circumstances, their step-child.

The parent must have at least shared care (1.1.S.40) of the child during the relevant care period.

• be either under 18 years of age
• have turned 18 and still be in secondary school (1.1.S.10) and the last day of secondary school year has not yet occurred, and
• not be a member of a couple (1.1.M.10)

The parent must not be assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210). If the parent is assessed in respect of the COTC, then that child is included in the calculations as a multi-case child.


In the case of a step-child, the parent has a duty to maintain that child by order of the court under either the FL Act or the WA Family Court Act 1997. If the parent does not have such an order, they may be able to apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if their capacity to provide financial support for the child/ren of the assessment is significantly reduced because of the responsibility of the parent to maintain the step-child.

# 1.1.R.90 Resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction


## Definition


A person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction if they are habitually resident in the reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10).


In making a decision about whether a person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction the ordinary meaning of 'resident' needs to be considered. The Macquarie Dictionary defines 'reside' as 'to dwell permanently or for a considerable time; have one's abode for a time'.

• A person who has always lived in a reciprocating jurisdiction will be resident there.
• A person who has moved to a reciprocating jurisdiction from another country intending to reside there permanently will generally be a resident of that country from the time they arrive.

Where a person has arrived in a reciprocating jurisdiction and they are not intending to reside there permanently or their intention is not clear, the following factors will be considered when deciding if they are resident in the reciprocating jurisdiction for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes:

• the reason for the person's presence in the country
• the actual and intended length of the person's stay
• the person's family and business/employment ties in the reciprocating jurisdiction and any other country, and
• the person's social and living arrangements in the reciprocating jurisdiction and any other country

The weight given to each factor will vary according to the circumstances of the individual.

However, any payment of Defence Force Income Support Allowance under Part VIIAB of the Veterans' Entitlements Act made before, on or after 1 January 2022 remains part of ATI for child support purposes.

# 1.1.T.50 Total net investment loss


## Definition


Total net investment loss of an individual for an income year means the sum of:

• the amount (if any) by which the individual's deductions for the income year that are attributable to financial investments exceed the individual's gross income for that year from those investments, and
• the amount (if any) by which the individual's deductions for the income year that are attributable to rental property exceed the individual's gross income for that year from rental property.

Financial investments include shares, managed investment schemes, forestry managed investment schemes, and a right or option in respect of any such investment.


In calculating the loss amount relevant to financial investments the gross income and related deductions are considered to determine if there is a net financial investment loss. A similar exercise is undertaken to identify if there is a net rental property loss. Both loss amounts (if any) are then added together to identify the total net investment loss.


Example:If Kristyna has an income from wages of $40,000, an income from financial investments of $15,000 and investment deductions of $10,000, Kristyna's taxable income (1.1.T.20) is $45,000. As Kristyna's investment deductions do not exceed Kristyna's investment income, there is no investment loss. Kristyna'sATI(1.1.A.20) is $45,000 for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes.


Example:If Brooke has an income from wages of $40,000, an income from financial investments of $15,000 and investment deductions of $20,000, Brooke's taxable income is $35,000. The investment loss of $5,000 is then added back to Brooke's taxable income to arrive at an ATI of $40,000 for child support purposes.


Example:If Andre has an income from wages of $10,000 and a net rental property loss of $15,000, Andre's taxable income is $0. The net rental property loss of $15,000 is then added back to Andre's taxable income of $0 to arrive at an ATI of $15,000 for child support purposes.


Note:Prior to the 2009-10 financial year only net losses incurred in relation to rental property investments were included when calculating an ATI.

# 1.2.1.20 Child Support Account


## Context


The Child Support Account (the Account) is established under the CSRC Act to enable Services Australia to receive payments in relation to child support debts, carer debts and enforceable maintenance liabilities from payers which are then transferred to payees.


## Description


Any payments Services Australia receives are credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (consolidated revenue). Services Australia must transfer the following amounts from consolidated revenue into the Account (CSRC Act section 74(1)):

• payment received to pay a child support debt or carer debt, including payments received from employers
• amounts received from a payers of an enforceable maintenance liabilities as a voluntary payment, and
• amounts equal to amounts that are to be debited where the Registrar has determined certain amounts are payable to persons under the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 75(1)(c)).

The purposes of the Account are to make payments:

• to payees of registered maintenance liabilities
• to payees of registrable carer liabilities (to repay a child support overpayment)
• to make payments to payees of enforceable maintenance liabilities voluntarily paid by a payer, and
• to make other payments the Registrar has determined for the purposes of the CSRC Act are payable to persons in respect of child support.

In cases where the Registrar has credited the Account in relation to an unremitted deduction made by an employer (CSRC Act section 77) or in relation to an unexplained remittance from an employer (CSRC Act section 78(3)), the Registrar may debit amounts from employers and payers from the Account.

# 1.2.2.10 Objects of the CSA Act


## Context


The CSA Act is an Act to make provision for determining the financial support payable by parents for their children, and for other purposes.


## Principal object of the CSA Act


The principal object of the CSA Act is to ensure that children receive a proper level of child support from their parents (CSA Act section 4).


## Particular objects of the CSA Act


The CSA Act should ensure that (CSA Act section 4):

• the level of financial support to be provided for children should be based on the financial capacity of each parent. Parents with a like capacity to support their children should provide like amounts of financial support
• the level of financial support that is provided by parents for their children should be determined in accordance with the costs of the children
• parents and carers who provide ongoing daily care for children should be able to have the level of financial support to be provided for the children readily determined without the need for court proceedings
• children share in changes in the standard of living of both of their parents, whether or not they live with both or either of them, and
• Australia is in a position to give effect to its obligations under international agreements or arrangements which relate to maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage or marriage.

## Intention of the Parliament


It is the intention that the CSA Act should be interpreted and administered, to the greatest extent consistent with the attainment of its objects, (CSA Act section 4):

• to permit parents to make private arrangements for the financial support of their children, and
• to limit interferences with the privacy of parents and carers.

## Duty of parents to maintain their children


It is a long-standing principle that parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children. The CSA Act therefore specifies that the parents of a child have the primary duty to maintain the child (CSA Act section 3).


The duty of a parent to maintain a child:

• is not lower in priority than the duty of a parent to maintain any other child or person
• has priority over all commitments of the parents apart from necessary commitments for self-support or necessary commitments to support another child or person that the parent has a duty to maintain, and
• is not affected by the duty of any other person to maintain the child or any entitlement the child, or another person may have to receive an income tested pension, benefit or allowance.

# 1.2.3 Types of child support arrangements


## Administrative assessment (including change of assessment)


### Administrative assessments


In Australia, most child support assessments are calculated according to an administrative formula (child support formula) (2.2). The child support formula determines how the costs of each child in a child support assessment are to be shared by each parent (either by care and/or the payment of child support).


The child support formula identifies the costs of the children based on the parents’ combined child support income as well as the number and age of the children in the assessment. The child support formula is based on extensive research into how much parents spend on children, which found that expenditure on children is different in households with different income levels, numbers of children and children of different ages.


### Change of assessment & orders varying assessments


If parents believe that a formula-based assessment does not reflect the special circumstances of their case, they may apply to Services Australia for a change of assessment (Part 5). The change of assessment process allows Services Australia to examine the broader financial circumstances of both parents and make a decision to depart from the formula assessment.


In some circumstances a parent may apply to a court for departure from the formula assessment. A parent who has an assessment may also apply to a court for other orders, including for an order for child support to be provided in a form other than periodic amounts or for an order for a lump sum amount.


Policy reference:CS Guide2.2The formulas,Part 5Change of assessment,10.4.2Applications & orders about decisions under the CSA Act


## Child support agreements (binding or limited)


Parents may choose to negotiate their own child support arrangements through a child support agreement (6.1). A child support agreement is a written agreement between parents (and/or a non-parent carer) on the amount of child support to be paid, and how it will be paid.


Agreements can specify the amount, frequency and method of payments but must meet the requirements of the legislation in order to be accepted by Services Australia.


Act reference:CSA ActPart 6—Consent arrangements


Policy reference:CS GuidePart 6Agreements


## Maintenance under family law


A person can only apply for a court order for child maintenance under Australian family law if they are not eligible to apply for a child support assessment for that child under the CSA Act.


A financial agreement under the FL Act can also be a binding child support agreement for child support purposes if it complies with the necessary requirements in the CSA Act ('Child support agreements’).


Act reference:FL ActPart VII Division 7—Child maintenance orders, Part VIIIA—Financial agreements


## Self-managed


Parents are able to make private arrangements for the financial support of their children, and are not required to formalise a financial arrangement through the Child Support Scheme or family law.

# 1.2.1.10 The Child Support Registrar & the Child Support Register


## Context


This topic explains the role of the Child Support Registrar and the purpose of the Child Support Register.


## Child Support Registrar


The CSRC Act establishes the position of the Child Support Registrar.


The Child Support Registrar is the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia. If that position ceases to exist, the Child Support Registrar is to be a person appointed by the Governor-General by written instrument.


The CSRC Act also makes arrangements for a person to act as the Child Support Registrar (if there is an acting Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia).


The acting Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia is to act as the Child Support Registrar during a vacancy in the position, or during any period that the Child Support Registrar is absent from duty from Australia or is unable to perform their duties.


If the position of Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia ceases to exist, the Secretary may, in writing, appoint a person to act as the Child Support Registrar.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 10 Child Support Registrar, section 10A Acting Child Support Registrar

# 1.3.1.10 History of the Scheme


## History of the Scheme


Prior to the introduction of an administrative Child Support Scheme in 1988, it was generally recognised that the system where child maintenance was dealt with by the courts was not working for the benefit of all separated parents and their children. For example:

• Obtaining a court order was too expensive for many separated parents.
• The courts were ordering consistently low levels of maintenance which did not reflect the capacity of parents to provide financial support for their children.
• Orders made by the courts could not be easily updated to take account of inflation or changes in the parents' capacity to pay.
• It was difficult to enforce court orders and less than 30% of child maintenance was being paid.
• There had been a rapid increase in the divorce rate with a corresponding increase in the number of parents receiving government benefits.

In October 1986 the Australian Government proposed reform in 3 areas:

• enforcement of maintenance collection through theATO
• use of a formula to determine the level of maintenance, and
• the application of this formula by an administrative process.

In February 2006 the Federal Government announced further reforms to the Child Support Scheme. These reforms represented the first major reforms to the scheme since its inception. The reforms were prompted by changing social trends and a desire to place increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility. These reforms aim to recognise the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives after separation.


These reforms to the Scheme were implemented in a 3-stage process with the first stage reforms commencing in July 2006, the second stage in January 2007 and the final stage in July 2008.


The complete history of legislative changes (including both minor and significant reforms) made to the CSRC Act and the CSA Act from 1988 to the present are outlined in1.3.2.10and1.3.2.20respectively.

## From 14 October 2024


Commencement of theART, which replaced theAATas the Commonwealth body for merit review of administrative decisions. As with the AAT, most child support objection decisions are subject to ART review and second review is also available for some child support decisions, including care percentage decisions. A key feature of the ART reforms is the introduction of the guidance and appeals panel, which is available in certain circumstances for child support decisions where there is an issue of significance to administrative decision-making, or the ART decision contains an error of fact or law materially affecting the ART decision. The ability to apply for a referral to the guidance and appeals panel varies depending on whether ART second review is available for a child support decision. There are arrangements governing the transition from the AAT to the ART.


## From 1 July 2023


Amendments to allow the Registrar to refuse applications made on or after 1 July 2023 for aDACwhere security has been offered, if the Registrar is not satisfied that theDPOwould be required to be revoked within a reasonable period of time. In most cases, this would be where the debtor has failed to make satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge the debt.


Amendments to allow the Registrar to commence deductions from a parent’s salary or wages via employer withholding (EW) where a person does not have an ongoing child support liability (payer or payee), but they still have outstanding child support, carer and/or related debts. This will enable debts to be collected via EWs even after an enforceable maintenance liability period has ended.


## From 17 August 2022


Amendments to procedures and powers relating to AAT first review, including providing that the AAT Act now applies for summoning parties and obtaining evidence.


In relation to a first review, the AAT may require a person who is not a party to the review to give information that is relevant to the review if the AAT reasonably believes the party has such information.


## From 18 February 2022


Amendments to clarify that any parent or non-parent carer entitled to be notified of an objection to a care percentage decision can seek review of the objection decision at the AAT. Where the objection decision is a not a care percentage decision, any person entitled to be served a copy of the objection is entitled to seek review.


Amendments to ensure procedural fairness and consistency for matters heard in the Social Services and Child Support Division of the AAT.


## From 1 January 2022


References to Defence Force Income Supplement Allowance (DFISA) were removed from the CSRC Act by Schedule 1 of theVeterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Act 2021. DFISA was an income support payment paid by the Department of Veteran's Affairs, which has now ceased due to changes made by the amending Act to how 'adjusted disability pension' would be treated by income tests under social security law. Therefore, DFISA is no longer considered a tax-free pension or benefit for purposes of Child Support.


However, savings provisions - which allow some or all of a repealed law to remain in force under specific circumstances - contained in the amending Act operate to preserve Services Australia’s ability to request deductions be made from any DFISA payments which may still be made on, or after, 1 January 2022 relating to a claim period prior to 1 January 2022.


## From 1 September 2021


The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia was created to bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as an overarching, unified administrative structure. The Family Court continues in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 1), and the Federal Circuit Court continues in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 2). The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia was created by theFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021.


TheFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2021made consequential amendments to the CSRC Act to reflect the creation of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and its role in hearing child support matters.


## From 21 November 2020


The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Services Australia will automatically be the Child Support Registrar and a person appointed as acting CEO will automatically be the acting Child Support Registrar.


If the position of CEO of Services Australia has ceased to exist:

• the Governor-General may appoint a person as Child Support Registrar, and
• the Secretary ofDSSmay appoint a person to act as Child Support Registrar when necessary.

## From 1 October 2020


If employers choose to report EWs and garnishee amounts from salary or wages to theATOthrough single touch payroll, they do not also have to report the amounts to Services Australia. The Registrar can require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information that is in the possession of the Commissioner, or that may come into the Commissioner's possession, including tax file numbers. This requirement may be of a standing nature and allows for the ongoing disclosure of information through single touch payroll.


## From 13 June 2020


The CSRC Regs were amended to:

• replace the reference to newstart allowance withJSPfor the purpose of working out the protected earnings rate
• update the list of reciprocating jurisdictions, and
• update the list of powers of the Registrar that the AAT must not exercise for the purposes of an AAT first review to include certain powers related to carer debts, for consistency with the treatment of child support debts.

## From 1 February 2020


The definition of Human Services Department was amended to reflect the establishment of Services Australia and the definition of Human Services Secretary was amended to reflect the abolition of this position and the establishment of the position of the CEO of Services Australia. Amendments were also made to ensure that information about a person that was obtained from the records of the formerDHSor Services Australia is protected by the secrecy provisions in the Act.


## From 1 July 2018


The CSRC Act was amended to:

• align the Registrar's ability to recover a child support overpayment from a payee with the methods for recovering a child support debt from a payer
• ensure that backdated reductions to a child support assessment collected by the Registrar are recoverable, and
• include new provisions in relation to backdating of assessments and provide a fairer basis for retrospectively creating a child support overpayment or underpayment due to some changes of circumstances.

## From 1 May 2018


The CSRC Act was amended to allow deductions from a person's Veteran Payment where they owe a child support debt, which is consistent with other income support payments under theVeterans' Entitlements Act 1986.


## From 1 July 2016


The definition of 'resident of Australia' was amended by theNorfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015and theTerritories Legislation Amendment Act 2016. These amendments provide that residents of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables residents of these external territories to apply for child support (1.6.1).


## From 1 July 2015

• The AAT, Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) and Migration Review Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal were merged. The amalgamated tribunal was established under the AAT Act and is called the AAT.
• Child support decisions previously reviewed by the SSAT are now reviewed by the amalgamated tribunal in its Social Services and Child Support Division.
• The amendments preserved the right for child support care percentage decisions to undergo a 2-stage review process within the amalgamated tribunal. Previously an applicant would have appealed to the SSAT for a review of a child support care percentage decision and then potentially to the AAT. They will now instead apply for an AAT first review to the amalgamated tribunal and potentially an AAT second review to the amalgamated tribunal.
• Other child support decisions which were previously only reviewable by the SSAT and then appealable directly to a court, will now instead be subject to an AAT first review by the amalgamated tribunal and would then be appealable to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law. Where the amalgamated tribunal decision did not involve a presidential member (that is, a Deputy President or the President), parties may choose whether to appeal to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit Court.

## From 12 April 2013


The Federal Magistrates Court of Australia became known as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The following references in the CSRC Act were changed:

• Federal Magistrates Court to 'Federal Circuit Court of Australia'
• Federal Magistrates Rules to 'Federal Circuit Court Rules'
• Federal Magistrate to 'Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia'.

## From 30 June 2012


Any automated decisions using a computer program are considered to have been made by the Registrar.


## From 5 August 2011


If an employer is required to make an EW (7.4.3.20) deduction and fails to remit the payment, the Registrar can impose penalties on the employer. Alternatively the Registrar may also take court action against employers for this breach of duty.


## From 1 July 2011


The services of the Child Support Agency, Medicare Australia, Centrelink and CRS Australia are delivered by the integrated Australian GovernmentDHS.


## From 27 June 2011


All references to 'month' have been clarified to 'Calendar month'.


## From 1 October 2010


The Registrar can give written notice to the Secretary of the department to deduct an amount from a parent's parental leave pay (7.4.4.40) to collect the parent's child support or spousal maintenance debt. Payment of parental leave pay commences from 1 January 2011 for eligible parents.


## From 1 July 2010

• The way that care percentage decisions are reviewed has changed as a result of sharing care decisions (4.3) acrossDHSfor child support andFTBpurposes. A party to an assessment can object (10.2.2) to DHS for review of a care percentage decision. The objection to the Registrar to the care decision can be made either orally or in writing. A party may object to the care decision any time, however the date of effect of the objection care decision will vary depending on whether the objection was lodged within, or outside, the 28 days from the date of the original care decision (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction).
• A party to an assessment who is dissatisfied with the department's objection care percentage decision can apply to the AAT or the SSAT for review of the decision, at any time.
• A parent can object to the Registrar's decision to refuse to accept an election for a new year to date income amount (10.2.2).
• A parent can object to the Registrar's determination of a year to date income amount (10.2.2).

## From 1 March 2009


The definition of registrable maintenance liability at CSRC Act section 18 is extended to include a liability of a party to a de facto relationship to pay periodic maintenance (9.1.3) to the other party of the de facto relationship.


## From 10 December 2008

• The DPO (8.3.3) provisions are extended to allow the Registrar to issue a DPO to prevent a person from leaving Australia if the person owes child support in another country and the liability and any arrears have been registered with the Registrar.
• Selected SSAT decisions about child support matters may be published. All identifying information will first be removed.

## From 1 July 2008

• A new Child Support Scheme comes into operation from 1 July 2008. This is the most significant change since the inception of the Child Support Scheme.
• The changes to the Scheme build on the Government's reform of the family law system which seek to encourage shared parenting, reduce conflict and make sure child support is paid in full and on time.
• In changing the Scheme the Government has accepted the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson (In the Best Interests of Children, May 2005). This review was conducted in response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on child custody arrangements in the event of family separation (Every picture tells a story, December 2003).
• The Taskforce found that the Scheme needed to be updated to reflect the substantial changes in our society since the Scheme was first established in 1988. It highlighted the need for a much greater emphasis on shared parental responsibility and a growing recognition of the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives after separation.
• The changes to the Scheme are significant and therefore the child support legislation has been amended extensively to bring these changes about. A summary of some of the more significant changes to the CSRC Act that are operative from 1 July 2008 are outlined below:Prescribed non-agency payments (7.5.1) (7.5.2) do not apply to parents whose child support liability reflects at least regular care of any of the children to whom the relevant administrative assessment relates.The provisions for objecting (10.2.2) to Registrar decisions have been updated to reflect the new formula and notional assessments.A party aggrieved by a decision of the SSAT under CSRC Act Part VIIA relating to a party's percentage of care for a child has appeal rights to theAAT.Lump sum payments (7.5.3) are credited against the payer's liability under CSRC Act section 69A (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment). As at 1 July each year, the remaining lump sum credit is then indexed in accordance with changes in theCPI.A payee's application to have a child support liability again collected by the Registrar (7.4.1.10) will be granted unless the payer can demonstrate that it should not be granted for one of the reasons specified in CSRC Act section 39(5).The Registrar can request the Repatriation Commission to make deductions from certain Veterans' Affairs (7.4.4.30) payments in order to pay child support debts.
• Prescribed non-agency payments (7.5.1) (7.5.2) do not apply to parents whose child support liability reflects at least regular care of any of the children to whom the relevant administrative assessment relates.
• The provisions for objecting (10.2.2) to Registrar decisions have been updated to reflect the new formula and notional assessments.
• A party aggrieved by a decision of the SSAT under CSRC Act Part VIIA relating to a party's percentage of care for a child has appeal rights to theAAT.
• Lump sum payments (7.5.3) are credited against the payer's liability under CSRC Act section 69A (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment). As at 1 July each year, the remaining lump sum credit is then indexed in accordance with changes in theCPI.
• A payee's application to have a child support liability again collected by the Registrar (7.4.1.10) will be granted unless the payer can demonstrate that it should not be granted for one of the reasons specified in CSRC Act section 39(5).
• The Registrar can request the Repatriation Commission to make deductions from certain Veterans' Affairs (7.4.4.30) payments in order to pay child support debts.

## From 1 January 2008

• The Registrar can issue a notice to someone who owes a child support debtor money requiring that the money be paid to the Registrar in satisfaction of child support related debts (CSRC Act section 72A notice (8.3.2)) for less than the total amount of outstanding child support.
• The Registrar is not required to serve a copy of the objection (10.2.6) and accompanying documents on the other parent where the objection is to the making of, or refusal to make, a departure determination under CSA Act Part 6A if the Registrar is satisfied that the rights of the other parent will not be affected by any decision made by the Registrar.
• Parents can apply for an extension of time (10.2.5) to submit an objection over the phone as well as in writing.
• Payers can object (10.2.2) to the acceptance of their application for a child support assessment.
• Range of debts collectable via tax refund intercepts is extended (8.3.1).

## From 19 July 2007


The CSRC Act was amended to incorporate measures relating to Australia's international obligations (1.5) in relation to maintenance, these measures were previously contained in separate regulations. There were also minor amendments to the legislation as follows:

• A maintenance liability cannot be registered under the CSRC Act unless one party resides in Australia.
• One registered maintenance liability will cease to have effect if a second maintenance liability is registered in relation to the same child, payee and payer. The Registrar is able to refuse to accept an application for an Australian child support assessment that would override an overseas liability already registered.
• A payer is able to apply for registration of a maintenance liability provided that either the payer or the payee resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction.
• There are some increased time allowances in relation to various processes where one party to a maintenance liability is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction. Generally these increased time allowances apply only to the party who is resident in the reciprocating jurisdiction.
• A person who has a liability to pay child support to the Registrar because of an overseas maintenance liability is able to apply for non-enforcement of the liability during a period of low income.

## From 22 June 2007

## From 29 March 2024


From 29 March 2024 interim period arrangements were restored to address the unintended consequences of theFamily Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018(Protecting Children Act), which had prevented an interim period where there was a care change after the initial child support assessment. This severely limited the circumstances in which an interim period determination could be made. Since the amendments made by theSocial Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support and Family Assistance Technical Amendments) Act 2024(the Technical Amendments Act), interim period determinations are available as they are intended to be, consistent with the longstanding policy to encourage carers of a child to comply with a written care arrangement where one is in place.


The validity of certain interim period determinations that were made between the commencement of the Protecting Children Act amendments and the commencement of the amendments made by the Technical Amendments Act, are protected. This minimises the impact on parents and caregivers of children who may otherwise be disadvantaged by having past decisions disrupted.


## From 1 July 2023

• Where a parent has lodged a 'RNN' advice for a financial year with theATOfor the 2022-23 and subsequent financial years, the Registrar may determine that parent’sATIto be equal to the relevant self-support amount.
• The relevant self-support amount is the amount that applied as at 1 January of the financial year the RNN advice applied to.
• These provisions apply in relation toCSPsstarting on or after 1 July 2023.

## From 1 January 2022


References to Defence Force Income Supplement Allowance (DFISA) were removed from the CSA Act by Schedule 1 of theVeterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Exempting Disability Payments from Income Testing and Other Measures) Act 2021. DFISA was an income support payment paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has now ceased due to changes made by the amending Act to how ‘adjusted disability pension’ would be treated by income tests under social security law.


However, savings provisions - which allow some or all of a repealed law to remain in force under specific circumstances - contained in the amending Act operate to preserve Services Australia’s ability to request deductions be made from any DFISA payments which may still be made on, or after, 1 January 2022 relating to a claim period prior to 1 January 2022.


## From 1 September 2021


The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia was created to bring together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as an overarching, unified administrative structure. The Family Court continues in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 1), and the Federal Circuit Court continues in existence as the Federal Circuit and Family Court (Division 2). The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia was created by theFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021.


TheFederal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 2021made consequential amendments to the CSA Act to reflect the creation of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and its role in hearing child support matters.


## From 14 November 2020


The Minister may determine an appropriateAWEamount for child support assessment purposes, where publication of the trend AWE figure has been suspended. This allows for child support assessment processes to continue in extraordinary circumstances that prevent the Australian Statistician from publishing the relevant AWE figure, for example due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market.


## From 1 October 2020


The Registrar can require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information that is in the possession of the Commissioner, or that may come into the Commissioner's possession, including tax file numbers. This requirement may be of a standing nature and allows for the ongoing disclosure of information through single touch payroll.


## From 13 June 2020


The CSA Regs were amended to prescribe National Redress Scheme payments, so that these payments are not included when determining a parent's income under CSA Act subsection 66A(4).


## From 20 March 2020


Subsection 5(1) was amended to remove wife pension under Part 2.4 of the SSAct from the definition of 'tax free pension or benefit' due to the cessation of this payment.


## From 1 February 2020


Amendments were made to ensure that information about a person that was obtained from the records of the formerDHSor Services Australia is protected by the secrecy provisions in the Act.


## From 1 July 2018


The CSA Act was amended to:

• allow for courts to set aside child support agreements made before 1 July 2008, as well as allowing all child support agreements to be set aside without having to go to court if certain circumstances change, and
• make consequential amendments related to overpayments (1.3.2.10), includingthe amendment of CSA Act section 143 to extend the ability to apply for a court recovery order for overpayments of child support for registered maintenance liabilities (which can include other types of child maintenance liabilities that have originated outside the CSA Act but collected under the CSRC Act) where a decision is made that the liability should have never existed in the first instanceincome date of effect, andcare date of effect.
• the amendment of CSA Act section 143 to extend the ability to apply for a court recovery order for overpayments of child support for registered maintenance liabilities (which can include other types of child maintenance liabilities that have originated outside the CSA Act but collected under the CSRC Act) where a decision is made that the liability should have never existed in the first instance
• income date of effect, and
• care date of effect.
• remove the requirements for the Secretary (Chief Executive of Centrelink) to approve a CSA Act section 151 election to end an assessment.

The following references in the CSA Act were amended by theTreasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Act 2017in relation to the First Home Super Saver Scheme:

• for the purposes of working out a parent's ATI CSA Act section 43(1)(a) was amended to insert 'disregarding the parent's assessable First Home Super Saver released amount (within the meaning of theIncome Tax Assessment Act 1997) for that year of income', and
• for the purposes of when a parent elects to estimate an income, the definition of income component amounts (CSA Act section 60(2)(a)) was amended to disregard any assessable First Home Super Saver released amount (within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act) that may be included in the parent's assessable income.

## From 23 May 2018


The CSA Act was amended to:

• extend the interim period that applies for recently-established court-ordered care arrangements and provide incentives for the person with increased care to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution where a care dispute relates to an older court order, a parenting plan or a written agreement, and
• allow the Registrar to take into account an amended tax assessment in an administrative assessment of child support if it results in a higher taxable income or, where it results in a lower taxable income, if certain conditions are met based on the reason for the amended tax assessment and the timeliness of action taken to obtain an amended tax assessment.

## From 1 July 2016


The meaning of 'resident of Australia' was amended by theNorfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015and theTerritories Legislation Amendment Act 2016. These amendments provide that residents of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are residents of Australia for child support purposes, and enables the residents of these external territories to apply for child support (1.6.1).


TheChild Support (Assessment) Amendment (Territories) Regulation 2016removed Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands from regulation 4 of theChild Support (Assessment) Regulations 1989(now section 6 of the CSA Regs). Section 6 excludes a child from being an eligible child if the child is cared for under a child welfare law of Western Australia or South Australia.


## From 1 July 2013


The AWE (2.3.2) amount used in the ATI indexation factor will be based on the relevant December quarter and will apply to CSPs starting on or after 1 July 2013.


## From 12 April 2013


The Federal Magistrates Court of Australia became known as the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. The following references in the CSA Act were changed:

• Federal Magistrates Court to 'Federal Circuit Court of Australia'
• Federal Magistrates Rules to 'Federal Circuit Court Rules'
• Federal Magistrate to 'Judge of the Federal Circuit Court of Australia'.

## From 1 January 2013


The annualisedMTAWE(2.3.2) amount used in child support assessments will be based on the June quarter and will apply to CSPs starting in 2013.


## From 17 November 2012 (with retrospective effect)


An amendment to CSA Act section 107 altered the implementation of declarations made for children during periods when a liability existed for that child only and the payer continues to be liable for other children in the assessment. The amendment specifies that a payer needs to seek a parentage overpayment order to be repaid monies paid for the child during such a period.


## From 1 July 2012


The Registrar may decide in special circumstances that a parent or non-parent carer's percentage of care for a child should be immediately based on the care that is actually occurring, despite a person taking reasonable action to reinstate care in accordance with a written agreement, parenting plan or court order.


## From 30 June 2012


Any automated decisions using a computer program are considered to have been made by the Registrar.


## From July 2011


### Amendments to income provisions

• Changes to the rules used to determine ATI (Part 3) for CSPs starting on or after 1 July 2011 where a parent has not lodged a tax return for the last relevant year of income.
• A new default income rule uses a parent's previous taxable income ATI, multiplied by the ATI indexation factor (2.3.2), if that amount is greater than two-thirds of the MTAWE, when the parent has not lodged tax returns for the last relevant year of income or the previous year.

## From 1 July 2010


### Amendments to care provisions

• Care determinations (4.3) for child support andFTBpurposes can be shared where there is a child recognised in a child support assessment and a person receives FTB for the child. Where care determinations are shared for a child, parents and carers need to inform either the Registrar or the Secretary of any changes in care.
• A new percentage of care can be determined whenever the care of a child has changed. A care period (4.1.1) will generally be a period starting 12 months from the day on which an application for assessment is made or from the day on which the change in the actual care for a child changed (the date of event). However, the date of effect (4.3) of the care change will be applied differently for child support and FTB purposes.
• The types of care determinations (4.1.5) that the Registrar can make have changed. The Registrar will usually determine a percentage of care based on the actual care (4.3) that each parent or carer has of the child. A written agreement, parenting plan or court order can only be used to determine the percentage of care in limited circumstances where care is disputed (4.2).

### Amendments to income estimate provisions


An income estimate (3.4) can be made for a year of income, or part of a year of income. A year of income is the financial year, that is 1 July to 30 June.


## From 1 July 2009


### Amendments to recognise same sex couples


The parentage provisions (2.1.3) were amended to reflect the changes made to the FL Act to recognise that the members of a same sex couple may be the parents of a child, and if so, could be assessed as parents for child support.


### Amendments to the definition of income used for child support purposes

• The income component of 'net rental property losses' was replaced by a new component 'the total net investment loss' which includes rental property losses and net financial investment losses, and
• a new income component 'reportable superannuation contribution amounts' is included when calculating a parent's ATI (Part 3).

## From 6 January 2009


### Amendments to care provisions

• Changes in care arrangements that are less than one night per fortnight (7.1%) can be reflected by the Registrar if the change is because the care has fallen above or below 35%, or if the change is because an agreement, parenting plan or court order has been made.
• Changes in care can be reflected by the Registrar from the date the change happened if the Registrar is notified within 28 days of that date.
• Interim care determinations made on or after 6 January 2009 do not need to be reviewed if there are special circumstances that justify not doing so.

### Amendments to change of assessment provisions

• Both receiving and paying parents are able to apply for a change to their assessment because their childcare costs (5.2.6) significantly affect their ability to support a child.
• Non-parent carers who have childcare (5.2.6) costs that are equal or greater than 25% of theCOTC(as defined by the child support formula) will also be able to apply for their assessment to be changed in recognition of those costs.
• If parents reach an agreement about child support whilst the Registrar is considering a change of assessment application, the Registrar will accept the agreement (5.6.1) as long as the Registrar considers it is just and equitable to both parties to the agreement and the child. An agreement can be accepted even if it provides for child support at a rate less than the annual rate in place at the time.

### Amendments to provisions for reducing theMARto nil.


A parent may apply for their minimum assessment to be reduced to nil (2.3.4) for a whole CSP or they may nominate a portion of the period (not less than 2 months) to which the reduction may apply. For the application to be accepted, the parent must show that their annualised income for the period they nominated will be or was less than the MAR multiplied by the number of cases the parent has.


### Amendments to recognise overseas liabilities


Parents who have administrative assessments for children under the laws of a reciprocating jurisdictions can have these children reflected in their Australian assessment for the purposes of calculating their Australian child support obligation, including the calculation of the multi-case allowances and cap and apportionment of the MAR.


## From 1 July 2008

• A new Child Support Scheme comes into operation from 1 July 2008. This is the most significant change since the inception of the Child Support Scheme.
• The changes to the Scheme build on reform of the family law system which seeks to encourage shared parenting, reduce conflict and make sure child support is paid in full and on time.
• In changing the Scheme the Government accepted the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson (In the Best Interests of Children, May 2005). This review was conducted in response to the House of Representatives Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on child custody arrangements in the event of family separation (Every Picture Tells a Story, December 2003).
• The Taskforce found that the Scheme needed to be updated to reflect the substantial changes in society since the Scheme was first established in 1988. It highlighted the need for a much greater emphasis on shared parental responsibility and a growing recognition of the importance of both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives after separation.
• The changes to the Scheme are significant and therefore the child support legislation has been amended extensively to bring these changes about. A summary of some of the more significant changes to the CSA Act that are operative from 1 July 2008 are outlined below.

### New formula

• The Registrar will calculate child support using new formulas (2.2). There are several formulas which operate depending on whether the parties are parents of the child, or non-parent carers; and whether the parents have multiple cases; and whether a parent is deceased; or lives outside of Australia.
• Child support assessments will be based on the actual costs of children which have been determined according to Australian research showing that, as parental income rises, spending on children rises in dollar terms but falls as a percentage of income, and that expenditure on children increases as they get older. The costs of children represent the best estimate of the amount that parents on average spend on their children according to their income.
• The 'costs of children' based on the combined income of the parents are set out in the 'Costs of Children' table (2.3.1).

Some attributes of the new formula include:

• It uses an 'income shares'(Part 3)approach to calculate and share the costs of children.
• Both parents will have the same self-support amount(Part 3)(equal to one-third of the MTAWE).
• TheCOTCwill be derived from the parents' combined incomes.
• The COTC will be divided between the parents in proportions equal to their share of the combined income.
• It recognises the costs of contact (1.1.C.200) as a contribution to the COTC. Where a parent has care of the child for between 14 and 34% of the nights of the year, 24% of the COTC will be taken to be met.
• Where a parent has care of the child for 35% of the nights of the year, 25% of the COTC is taken to be met. This rises to 50% of the COTC being met when care is shared equally.
• It treats the children of first and second families as equally as possible by using the actual COTC from the second family in determining the child support payable (rather than a flat increase to the self-support amount).
• The income definitions (Part 3) used in the formula and to calculate FTB will be aligned. That is, the definition of 'ATI' will be broadened to include certain tax-free pensions and benefits that already apply for FTB purposes.

### Exclusion of additional income earned after separation


For the first 3 years after separation (3.5), parents will be able to apply to have additional income, such as their income from second jobs and overtime, excluded from child support calculations.


### Changes to child support agreements


There are new provisions relating to child support agreements (Part 6).

• From 1 July 2008, there are 2 types of child support agreements. These are:binding child support agreements (6.1) (including lump sum payment provision agreements), andlimited child support agreements (6.1).
• binding child support agreements (6.1) (including lump sum payment provision agreements), and
• limited child support agreements (6.1).
• FTB Part A payable to the payee will be calculated using a 'notional assessment' (6.3) of what the assessment would have been had there not been a child support agreement in place.
• Notional assessments will apply to all child support agreements (other than lump sum provisions) where the application is received after 1 July 2008, and where child support is already payable and the annual rate is affected by the provisions of the agreement.

### Lump sum orders


A person may apply to court for an order either that child support be provided otherwise than in the form of periodic payments (this type of lump sum payment was already in existence before 1 July 2008) or that child support be provided in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the liability (7.5.3) (this new type of lump sum payment order commences from 1 July 2008).


### Suspension of liability when parents reconcile


Where parents reconcile the Registrar may suspend child support payments for up to 6 months (2.6.1). If the parents separate again within that 6 months the assessment may be reinstated without the parents having to make a new application for child support.


### New change of assessment reason


Parents who have financial responsibility for a step-child (5.2.11) in a second family are able to apply to have the step-child considered when calculating child support for the parent's first family, if no one else can financially support the step-child.


### Minimum payments

• Parents who pay child support to 2 or more families will have to pay the minimum payment (2.3.4) to each family rather than dividing it between them.
• Parents who appear to be deliberately minimizing their income entitlements to avoid paying child support (that is, where a liable parent has a low income but does not receive any income support payments) will generally have aFARof child support (2.3.5) of $1,060 per annum (subject to indexation) per child.

## From 1 January 2008

• The definition of an income amount order (3.4) narrowed which provides parents an increased opportunity to lodge an estimate of income.
• Alteration of estimate provisions (3.4) to allow parents to lodge an estimate for the remainder of the CSP, after an income amount order expires.
• Parents can apply to extend the time a relevant dependent child (2.5.3) is taken into account in their child support assessment until the end of the school year if the child will turn 18 during that year and is still in full-time secondary education.
• A payer is able to have their relevant dependent child (2.5.4) taken into account in their child support assessment from the date the assessment started if they advise the Registrar within 28 days of the notice of assessment being issued to them and where notice issued after 4 December 2007.
• The rental property definition is updated.
• Assessment notices (3.5) to include only age range of relevant dependent children and children from other child support cases.

## From 19 July 2007


The CSA Act was amended to incorporate measures relating to Australia's international obligations in relation to maintenance. These measures were previously contained in separate regulations. There were also minor amendments to the legislation as follows:

• An application for assessment can only be accepted where at least one party resides in Australia. A terminating event occurs in relation to a child support assessment if both parties cease to be resident in Australia.
• An application for assessment from a payee who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction must be made through the central authority in the country where the payee resides. The application may be initiated by the payee and given to the central authority to forward to the Registrar, or may be initiated by the central authority.
• An application for assessment from a payer who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction may be made by the payer giving an application directly to the Registrar, or by giving an application to the central authority to forward to the Registrar.
• Where the application was initiated by a central authority on behalf of the payee, the central authority has power to veto the ending of the assessment by the payee.
• A child support agreement may be made between parents, one of whom is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction.
• A registered maintenance liability ceases to have effect if a second maintenance liability is registered in relation to the same child, payee and payer. The Registrar is able to refuse to accept an application for an Australian child support assessment that would override an overseas liability already registered.
• Provisions relating to determining overseas income apply in relation to a payee who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction but is covered by an Australian child support assessment.
• There are some increased time allowances in relation to various processes where one party to a maintenance liability is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction. Generally these increased time allowances apply only to the party who is resident in the reciprocating jurisdiction.
• The date from which an overseas maintenance liability first becomes enforceable is the date that the Registrar receives the application for registration.

## From 22 June 2007

• Some changes to the secrecy provisions (11.4.3) including the following:The Registrar can communicate protected information to persons as necessary to prevent a credible threat to the life, health or welfare of a person.The Registrar can communicate protected information to brief the Minister in respect of a range of circumstances relating to the Minister's duties.The Registrar can communicate protected information to a person who has the consent of the person to whom the information relates to obtain that information.The Registrar can communicate protected information in specific circumstances relating to missing people and locating a relative or beneficiary of a deceased person.A new offence for unauthorised disclosure (11.6.6) of information.
• The Registrar can communicate protected information to persons as necessary to prevent a credible threat to the life, health or welfare of a person.
• The Registrar can communicate protected information to brief the Minister in respect of a range of circumstances relating to the Minister's duties.
• The Registrar can communicate protected information to a person who has the consent of the person to whom the information relates to obtain that information.
• The Registrar can communicate protected information in specific circumstances relating to missing people and locating a relative or beneficiary of a deceased person.
• A new offence for unauthorised disclosure (11.6.6) of information.
• Removal of the restriction that information gathering by the Registrar (under CSA Act section 161) in respect of third parties is limited to financial information.
• Stay order provisions (10.4.6) have been removed from the CSA Act. All of the stay order provisions are located within the CSRC Act regardless of whether the relevant proceeding has commenced under the CSA Act or the CSRC Act.

## From 1 January 2007

• If a court grants a declaration that a person is not a parent of a child (under CSA Act section 107), the court must, as soon as practicable, consider making an order for repayment of child support (10.4.2) to the person who is not the parent of the child.

• Changes to levels of care of a child will have effect from the date the Registrar is notified of the change (4.1.5).

• The payer's exempt income amount is increased to 110% of the unpartnered rate of social security pension.

The Registrar made another new assessment if the payer's 1998-99 tax assessment issued before 1 June 2000, or if the payee's 1998-99 tax assessment issued first and the payee's income would affect the rate of child support.

## From 23 December 1997


A parent's election to use an estimate (3.4) of their taxable income has a limited retrospective effect.

The Registrar can now be satisfied that a person is a parent of a child (2.1.3) if:

• The Registrar can be satisfied that a person is a child's parent if one of a number of 'presumptions' (2.1.3) apply.
• The Registrar must refer a child support agreement to the Secretary if the payee receives more than minimum family payment or sole parent pension. The Registrar can only accept these agreements if the Secretary decides that the agreement passes the 'reasonable action to obtain maintenance' test.
• The Registrar must refuse to accept an agreement if the payee has not applied for a child support assessment and receives more than the minimum family payment or sole parent pension.

## From 1 July 1993

• A person who cares for a child between 30% and 40% of the nights in a child support year is now considered to be an eligible carer, with 'substantial contact'. The other person caring for the child has 'major contact'. The formula provisions are modified to give effect to this change.
• A payer or payee can no longer revoke their estimate of taxable income unless they made a new estimate election (3.4) (before 1 July 1993 a parent could revoke their estimate and have their case return to the previous assessment based upon their income 2 years prior).
• A parent can make a new estimate for a child support year (3.4) every 2 months instead of 3 months.
• Penalties apply for parents who underestimate (3.4) their taxable income.

## From 11 December 1992

• Court orders and court registered agreements for child support cease to have effect when the Registrar makes an administrative assessment of child support for that child (9.1.1) (before 6 April 1992, the Registrar would offset any amount payable under a court order with amounts payable under an administrative assessment).

# 1.3.2.30 History of the application of the CSRC Act to WA ex-nuptial cases


## Context


Prior to 15 May 2019, the arrangement by which the WA Parliament adopted child support laws meant that, from time to time, the Registrar needed to treat WA ex-nuptial cases differently to other cases.


The WA Parliament has adopted the CSRC Act and all amendments made to this Act. This means that the CSRC Act and all amendments made to this Act apply to WA ex-nuptial cases. With theChild Support (Commonwealth Powers) Act 2019(WA)(CS(CP)Act)receiving Royal Assent on 15 May 2019, the WA Parliament has also referred legislation power for matters in respect of the maintenance of ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth.

## WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 15 May 2019


From Royal Assent on 15 May 2019, the CS(CP)Act adopted all Commonwealth child support laws not previously adopted, referred legislative power in respect of the maintenance of ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth, and repealed theChild Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990(WA), as there is no further need for the WA Parliament to incrementally adopt Commonwealth amendments to child support legislation. Legislative powers over unmarried persons and their children in family law proceedings were not referred.


From 15 May 2019 the CS(CP)Act adopted the amended CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2018, including amendments made by theFamily Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018, including the application provisions in that Act.


On 23 May 2018, the CSA Act was amended by the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act to:

• extend the interim period that applies for recently-established court-ordered care arrangements and provide incentives for the person with increased care to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution where a care dispute relates to an older court order, a parenting plan or a written agreement (Part 3)
• allow the Registrar to take into account an amended tax assessment in an administrative assessment of child support if it results in a higher taxable income or, where it results in a lower taxable income, if certain conditions are met based on the reason for the amended tax assessment and the timeliness of action taken to obtain an amended tax assessment (3.2.2).

On 1 July 2018, the CSA Act was amended by the Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act to:

• allow for courts to set aside child support agreements made before 1 July 2008 (10.4.2), as well as allowing all child support agreements to be set aside without having to go to court if certain circumstances change (6.4)
• make consequential amendments related to overpayments (8.1.1)
• make changes to care date of effect (4.1.5)
• make changes to income date of effect (3.2.3)
• make changes to section 151 elections (2.6.2), and
• make changes to terminating events (2.6.3).

On 1 July 2018, the CSA Act was amended by theTreasury Laws Amendment (Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Measures No. 1) Act 2017. These amendments provide that for child support purposes, First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSS) released amounts will be disregarded from a parent'sATIfor the last relevant year of income in relation to theCSP(section 43(1)(a)), and in relation to the income component amounts as estimated by a parent for the year (section 60(2)(a)).


As these amendments occurred after the WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act as it existed on 1 July 2017, they apply from 15 May 2019, as a result of the passage of the CS(CP)Act. Prior to 15 May 2019, the 'ATI' definition in section 43(1)(a) of the CSA Act and the 'Income Component Amounts as Estimated by a Parent' definition in section 60(2)(a) of the CSA Act that applied to WA ex-nuptial cases did not disregard any FHSS released amounts for the last relevant year of income in relation to the CSP.

• The repeal of the definition of 'eligible carer' in section 5 and its replacement by section 7B.

• Either parent in WA ex-nuptial cases may now apply to a court for an order for departure from administrative assessment (10.4.2) (section 116), or appeal against an incorrect assessment (section 110), or appeal against the acceptance or non-acceptance of a child support agreement (section 132) providing at least one of the parents has objected to the Registrar's decision and the Registrar has disallowed the objection or allowed it in whole or in part.

## New child support assessments commencing 1 January 2001

The Registrar based the new child support assessment upon the parents' taxable income for 1999-00 if theATOhad issued an assessment of taxable income for that year for either parent. If neither parent's 1999-00 taxable income was available, the Registrar based the new assessment on the 1998-99 taxable income for each parent inflated by the relevant child support inflation factor.


## WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 1 January 2001


The following amendments applied to WA ex-nuptial cases from 1 January 2001:

• Child support for WA ex-nuptial cases is assessed in CSPs rather than child support years. A CSP may last up to 15 months.
• The assessments are based on taxable income for the most recent taxation year rather than taxable income for the financial year before last.
• The payee's disregarded income is based on the 'all employees average weekly earnings' figure rather than the usually higher AWE figure and extra amounts according to the age of the children were no longer added to it.
• The payer's exempt income amount was increased to 110% of the unpartnered rate of social security pension relevant to the one payable for the CSP.
• When the liable parent has relevant dependent children the exempt income amount is increased to 220% of the annual amount of the partnered rate of social security pension relevant to that payable for the CSP.
• The minimum child support rate payable is $260, not nil, and will not be reduced below $260 per annum unless the person's total income in the first 12 months of a CSP is less than $260.
• A payee can apply for a change of assessment if the child care costs they incur are high and cost more than 5% of their child support income amount.
• The Registrar cannot make a decision on a change of assessment application that the annual rate of child support in a case is to be reduced to nil.
• In calculating the amount payable in an assessment the payer's adjusted income is reduced by 50c for every dollar of the carer parent's income above the disregarded income amount.
• Any supplementary income (exempt foreign income, net rental losses and reportable fringe benefits) is added back to the liable parent's taxable income amounts.
• When the parents share care of the children of a relationship, additional amounts are added to the liable parent's exempt income for any children in their sole, major or shared care.

The Registrar may refuse, review or amend a payer or payee's estimate of income.


## WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 30 June 2000


The WA Parliament adopted further amendments to the CSA Act from 30 June 2000. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:

• The start date of the liability arising from acceptance of an application for an assessment in a WA ex-nuptial case is the date the application was lodged.
• Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can apply for the administrative assessment of child support for a child in secondary education to continue to the end of the school year in which the child turns 18.
• Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can now provide information and make some applications over the telephone, which the Registrar previously required in writing.
• The Registrar can now be satisfied that a person is a parent of a WA ex-nuptial child ifthe child is born within 44 weeks of a marriage being annulledthe child is born after a marriage has been dissolved but within 44 weeks after a period of cohabitation by the 2 people concerned, orthe child is born to a woman who lived with the man anytime during the period beginning 44 weeks and ending 20 weeks before the child's birth.
• the child is born within 44 weeks of a marriage being annulled
• the child is born after a marriage has been dissolved but within 44 weeks after a period of cohabitation by the 2 people concerned, or
• the child is born to a woman who lived with the man anytime during the period beginning 44 weeks and ending 20 weeks before the child's birth.
• Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases can object to decisions of the Registrar under the CSA Act.
• Payers and payees in WA ex-nuptial cases may only apply to a court for a departure from administrative assessment (section 116), or appeal against an incorrect assessment (section 110), or appeal against the acceptance or non-acceptance of a child support agreement (section 132) providing they have personally objected to the decision and it has been disallowed or partly allowed.
• The Registrar can make a decision to either increase or decrease the amount of child support payable when making a change of assessment decision on an application by a payer or payee in a WA ex-nuptial case.
• The Registrar can initiate a change of assessment in special circumstances for a WA ex-nuptial case.
• A liable parent in a WA ex-nuptial case can apply for an administrative assessment.
• The Registrar will include relevant dependent children in a child support assessment for a WA ex-nuptial case from the date of notification unless the Registrar is notified within 28 days of the child becoming a relevant dependent child, or within 28 days of a notice of assessment.
• Changes to levels of care of a child in a WA ex-nuptial case will have effect from the date the Registrar is notified of the change.
• Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases who receive more than the base rate ofFTBPart A can elect to end their assessment if the Secretary approves the election. The Secretary must be satisfied that the payee is taking reasonable action to obtain maintenance for the child.
• The Registrar must refer an agreement between the payer and payee in a WA ex-nuptial case, if the payee receives more than the base rate of FTB Part A, to the Secretary. The Registrar can only accept these agreements if the Secretary decides that the agreement passes the 'reasonable action to obtain maintenance' test.

## WA adoption of CSA Act amendments from 9 December 1994


The WA Parliament adopted amendments made to the CSA Act since the last adoption from 9 December 1994. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:

• Parents in a WA ex-nuptial case can apply to the Registrar for a change to their assessment in the special circumstances of the case for any child support year commencing 1 July 1992 onwards rather than applying to the court.
• Payees in WA ex-nuptial cases who receive more than minimum family payment can no longer elect to end their child support assessments.
• The Registrar no longer offsets overlapping liabilities for WA ex-nuptial cases. Instead, a court order for child support ceases to have effect when child support becomes payable under an administrative assessment for the child.
• A person is considered an eligible carer of a WA ex-nuptial child if they cared for the child for at least 30% of the nights in the child support year.
• If the payer or payee's taxable income for the last relevant year is not available when the Registrar is making a new child support assessment for a WA ex-nuptial case, the Registrar can choose an appropriate default income for that person. Before 9 December 1994, the Registrar was required to use a default income figure equivalent to 2.5 times AWE.
• A payer or payee in a WA ex-nuptial case can no longer revoke their estimate of taxable income unless they make a new estimate election. Before 9 December 1994 a person could revoke their estimate and have their case return to the previous assessment based upon their income 2 years prior. Estimates could also be replaced by new estimates every 2 months rather than 3 months.
• Courts are required to give reasons for making orders by consent for a change of assessment in special circumstances, or the provision of 'in kind' child support in cases where the payee in a WA ex-nuptial case received an income tested pension, benefit or allowance.

## WA adoption of CSA Act from 19 January 1991


WA Parliament adopted the CSA Act from 19 January 1991. From that date the following arrangements applied to WA ex-nuptial cases:

• Ex-nuptial children living in WA are eligible children for the purposes of the CSA Act and the people who care for them are able to apply for an administrative assessment of child support.

Carers of WA ex-nuptial children can no longer apply to the court for variations to existing court orders and registered agreements. A carer in a WA ex-nuptial case could have a court order for maintenance and be entitled to apply for an administrative assessment of child support payable by the same payer for the same child. In these cases, the Registrar offsets the overlapping court orders (or agreements) and administrative assessments.


## Commencement of the CSA Act


The CSA Act came into operation on 1 October 1989. It did not apply to WA ex-nuptial children immediately. Carers of ex-nuptial children resident in WA could still apply to the WA Family Court for orders for child maintenance. The Registrar could register these court orders under the CSRC Act.

# 1.5.2 International agreements & conventions


## Context


Australia is a party to a number of international agreements and conventions about international maintenance obligations.


## Act references


FL RegsPart 10 Division 5, Schedule 4


## On this page

• Australia and New Zealand agreement
• Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations
• Agreement between Australia and the United States of America
• United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance(UNCRAM)

## Australia & New Zealand agreement


The Australian and New Zealand governments entered into an agreement to facilitate the collection of liabilities under administrative assessments (1.1.A.30) of child support (1.1.C.60) from 1 July 2000. Under theAgreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Child and Spousal Maintenance, the Registrar and New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support can each collect child support liabilities assessed by the other authority.


The agreement limits the jurisdiction of the 2 Contracting States (that is, Australia and New Zealand). The Contracting State where the payee (1.1.P.30) is habitually resident (1.6.4) will issue and administer the assessment, and the Contracting State where the payer (1.1.P.40) resides will be responsible for collection. The agreement provides that a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) made in one Contracting State will end from the day before the date that Contracting State receives written notice that the payee is habitually resident in the other Contracting State. The notice can be from the payer, payee or the other Contracting State.


Article 24 of the agreement provides for the Registrar and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for New Zealand to make arrangements (the Service Arrangement) to facilitate the implementation of the agreement. The Service Arrangement deals with matters including procedural issues and the exchange of information. The full text of the agreement appears at Schedule 1 of the CSRC Regs.


## Hague Convention on the Recognition & Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations


On 1 February 2002 Australia became a Contracting State to the 1973 HagueConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to Maintenance Obligations(the Hague Convention). The Hague Convention applies to both spousal and child support obligations. It has the effect of establishing reciprocal agreements with other Contracting States to recognise and enforce maintenance decisions made by judicial or administrative authorities in Convention countries.


Like the New Zealand agreement, the Hague Convention provides for the recognition of administrative assessments (rather than just court orders or court registered agreements). The Hague Convention provides for the relatively simple and speedy enforcement of existing Australian liabilities by overseas courts and administrative authorities. However, a Contracting State will only recognise a decision of an administrative authority such as the Registrar if the laws of that State support that recognition.

## Agreement between Australia & the United States of America


TheAgreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America for the Enforcement of Maintenance (Support) Obligationscame into force on 12 December 2002. It replaces the former non-treaty arrangements between Australia and some individual states of the USA.


The agreement provides for:

• the enforcement of each State's court orders and administrative assessments by the other State
• the establishment of maintenance decisions, including in relation to parentage
• administrative assistance, and
• the sharing of information between the relevant State authorities.

For Australia, the agreement applies in Australia, Norfolk Island and the territories of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. For the USA, the agreement applies in the fifty states, American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and any other jurisdiction of the United States participating in Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.

## United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance


Australia is a Contracting Party to theUnited Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance(UNCRAM), which was signed in New York on 20 June 1956. UNCRAM aimed to overcome the legal and practical difficulties involved in establishing claims for maintenance abroad where other reciprocal arrangements did not exist.


Provisions under child support legislation, as well as FL Act section 111 and provisions of the FL Regs, are relevant to the operation of the Convention.


A payee in an UNCRAM State can make an application to an UNCRAM State where the liable parent resides for that State to establish a maintenance liability on their behalf. An UNCRAM State may also register an existing liability under this Convention but only where their domestic law allows.


A payee who resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) that is an UNCRAM State can make an application via the relevant overseas authority (1.1.O.30) if the payer resides in Australia. The application can be for registration of an existing overseas liability, or an application to establish a child support assessment.


If the payee does not have an existing overseas liability and is not eligible for an Australian assessment (for example, because the child is over 18), the payee can still make an application for establishment of a liability in Australia under the Convention, as provided for under Division 5 of Part 10 of the FL Regs.


A payee in Australia may need to make an UNCRAM application for establishment of a liability if they are seeking maintenance from a payer, but cannot otherwise do so (for example, because the laws of the reciprocating jurisdiction do not currently allow that jurisdiction to recognise a child support assessment). The Registrar will transmit the application to the relevant State.


The Registrar may also transmit an existing registered child support assessment or maintenance order to a reciprocating jurisdiction under UNCRAM if that is the only arrangement that exists between Australia and the reciprocating jurisdiction.


A court in the receiving UNCRAM State (that is, where the payer resides) will decide the level of maintenance payable under the relevant law in that jurisdiction (Article 6 of the Convention). It may take into account the information provided by the Registrar in making that decision.


A list of Convention countries is in Schedule 4 to the FL Regs.

# 1.4.3.20 Frequently asked questions – care


## On this page

• I have care of my child exactly half of the time – why does my child support assessment show I have 49% or 51% care?

## I have care of my child exactly half of the time – why does my child support assessment (1.1.C.70) show I have 49% or 51% care?


A parent’s (1.1.P.10) care percentage (1.1.C.20) is, in most cases, based on the number of nights they care for the child over a 12 month period. If the parent provides care for 50 per cent of the time, their care percentage is calculated by dividing the number of nights in a year (365 nights in a standard year) by two which results in 182.5 nights. Child support (1.1.C.60) legislation requires care percentages must be rounded to a whole number. If the percentage is less than 50 per cent, it is rounded down to the nearest whole number, and rounded up if it is greater than 50 per cent. This is why care percentages will be recorded as 49 per cent and 51 per cent where the care is shared equally between the parents. Please note that the lower percentage can be recorded for either parent.


Each parent’s care percentage is then converted to a cost percentage according to the Cost percentages (1.1.C.200) table. The cost percentage represents the proportion of the child's costs the person meets directly through care (1.1.C.10). For parents who have between 48 per cent to 52 per cent of care, their cost percentage is 50 per cent. Therefore, regardless of whether a parent has 51 per cent or 49 per cent care, the cost percentage for both parents is 50 per cent.

# 1.4.3.10 Frequently asked questions – income


## On this page

• Why is ATI used in child support assessments?
• Do I pay child support on tax I have paid?
• Why are parents allowed to have their child support assessment based on an estimate of income?
• Is there any discretion as to how a parent’s ATI is determined during an estimate review?
• How is an estimate reviewed when a lump sum has been received?

## Why isATIused in child support assessments?


Child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are generally based on both parents’ ATI (1.1.A.20) for the last relevant financial year because this is generally the most up-to-date and accurate income information available to Services Australia. The inclusion of supplementary amounts in the income base ensures that child support assessments are calculated according to each parent’s (1.1.P.10) financial capacity to provide for their children, regardless of how their income is structured.


The Australian Government supports families to make financial and investment decisions through the taxation system, and while these arrangements are legitimate for taxation purposes, they should not diminish a parent’s fundamental responsibility to support their children in line with their financial capacity to do so. Such financial options are generally the result of discretionary expenditure and often not available to other families, particularly those with low incomes.


## Do I pay child support on tax I have paid?


Parents are not expected to pay child support (1.1.C.60) on income that is subject to taxation. The child support liability generated by the child support formula (1.1.C.110) is based on costs of children research which identified the expenditure patterns of families with children at different levels of income. These patterns are derived from parents making expenditure decisions based on their post-tax income.


## Why are parents allowed to have their child support assessment based on an estimate of income?


A key objective of the Child Support Scheme is that parents financially support their children after separation, based on their financial capacity.


Income estimates (1.1.I.20) recognise that larger reductions in a parent’s income (that is, at least 15%) may affect their capacity to meet their financial obligations and ability to provide financial support to their children. Smaller changes to a parent’s income are considered to have less of an immediate impact on their financial circumstances, and will be reflected in their ATI for their child support assessment in the following year. This helps to maintain a reasonable level of stability in assessments and changes in income will still be reflected in future assessments without the need for frequent readjustments.


## Is there any discretion as to how a parent’s ATI is determined during an estimate review?


No. The ATI must reflect the parent's ATI that will be earned from the event date (or notification date) until the end of the estimate period.


## How is an estimate reviewed when a lump sum has been received?


Lump sums are treated no differently to 'regular' assessable income. Receipt of a lump sum will usually be an event for reviewing purposes. The Registrar needs to work out the income earned from the event date (or notification date) until the end of the original estimate period taking into account any assessable lump sum payment within that period.

# 1.4.1 Family & domestic violence


## Introduction


Services Australia operates in a sensitive environment and prioritises customer safety. This chapter contains information relevant to child support customers who are experiencing, or at risk of, family and domestic violence. This includes decisions a person affected by family and domestic violence may need to make about their child support case.


Child support andFTBare closely linked. It is important to understand how the decision to apply for a child support assessment (or not) may affect a parent’s FTB entitlement because of theMAT. It is also important to know that exemptions to the MAT are available if a parent is at risk of or experiencing family and domestic violence.


More information on how the Child Support Scheme interacts with FTB is found at1.4.2.


Policy reference:CS Guide1.4.2How do child support payments interact with FTB?


## On this page

• Child support customers at risk of family & domestic violence
• MAT for FTB Part A
• Applying for child support
• Ending a child support assessment due to family & domestic violence
• Reporting threats of family & domestic violence

## Child support customers at risk of family & domestic violence


Services Australia supports parents and carers who are experiencing, or at risk of, family and domestic violence through a trauma informed family and domestic violence identification and case management approach, and by offering referrals to organisations that can provide help. Support is available to parents who pay child support (payers), and parents and carers who receive child support (payees).


Services Australia's family and domestic violence identification approach includes targeted support for customers where the risk of family and domestic violence might be more prevalent. At these interactions, customers are asked a safety question and are provided an opportunity to discuss their circumstances. If family and domestic violence is evident, customers may be referred to a Services Australia Social Worker or external agency for assistance.


Where appropriate for specific cases, Services Australia will limit staff access to case information.


## MAT for FTB Part A


To receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A (andRA) for a child from a previous relationship, a parent is required to take reasonable action to meet the MAT. Generally, this will involve applying for a child support assessment.


The MAT does not apply to individuals who have care of a child, but are not considered to be their parent for child support purposes (that is, a non-parent carer, such as a grandparent of the child).


If a parent is experiencing or at risk of family and domestic violence, they can apply to Services Australia for a full or partial exemption from the MAT (FA Guide3.1.5.70). If a full exemption is granted the parent does not need a child support assessment in order to receive more than the base rate of FTB Part A.


FA Guide3.1.5provides information on the MAT which applies to separated parents who receive FTB Part A. CS Guide1.4.2provides information on the interaction between child support and FTB.


Policy reference:CS Guide1.4.2How do child support payments interact with FTB?


FA Guide3.1.5Maintenance action test for FTB Part A,3.1.5.70Exemptions from the maintenance action test


## Applying for child support


Either parent (or a non-parent carer) can apply for a child support assessment. When a person who makes a child support application is identified as being at risk of family and domestic violence, Services Australia will discuss their administrative options with them. There may be different options available depending on whether the applicant is likely to be the payer or payee once the child support assessment is made. This discussion could include details and consequences of:

• Proceeding or withdrawing an application
• Child support collection options

Services Australia will support the person’s decision about whether and how to pursue collection of child support.


Services Australia recognises that a person at risk may adopt one course of action for a period of time and may later adopt another course if the situation has changed. Services Australia will provide a person at risk with their options and encourage them to discuss their case if their situation changes.


### Proceeding or withdrawing an application


During an initial discussion with the child support applicant, an officer may become aware that the applicant may be at risk. The applicant will be advised that continuing with the application means that Services Australia will need to contact the other party to the assessment.


If the applicant has concerns about that contact, they can choose to withdraw the application and apply for an exemption from the MAT. The applicant will be advised of the option to reapply for child support if an exemption is not granted. A child support assessment will only apply from the date an application is made. A later application means a child support assessment will start from the later date.


If the applicant chooses not to withdraw their application, the application process will proceed.


### Child support collection options


The person who receives child support (the payee) determines if child support will be paid directly to them by the payer (private collect), or if Services Australia will be responsible for collecting the child support and paying it to them (agency collect). In either case, if one parent is at risk of, or experiencing, family and domestic violence Services Australia will take particular care to manage the case in a sensitive and appropriate manner and may refer the parent to other organisations for support.


In an agency collect arrangement, Services Australia is responsible for collecting child support from the payer and paying it to the payee.


Services Australia has extensive enforcement powers to collect child support. These powers include the ability to deduct child support from salary or wages (7.4.2) and certain income support payments (7.4.4.10), intercept tax refunds (8.3.1) and garnishee funds from bank accounts (8.3.2).


When a payee has an agency collect child support arrangement they can choose what method is used to estimate the child support they will receive during a year for the purposes of applying the maintenance income test. There are 2 ways to estimate how much child support will be received - the disbursement or entitlement method. The disbursement method may be more appropriate for payees who receive their child support payments irregularly or who are not being paid.


CS Guide1.4.2provides information on the interaction between child support and FTB, including the disbursement and entitlement method.


In a private collect arrangement, the payee and payer have joint responsibility for agreeing to and managing the payment of child support from one parent to another. Services Australia is unable to enforce the payment of child support in a private collect arrangement. If the private collect arrangement is not working – if payments are not being made in full or in a timely manner – the payee can ask Services Australia to collect their child support payments.


If a payee asks Services Australia to collect their child support payments, they can also apply for Services Australia to collect amounts the payer did not pay in the 3 months immediately before the date the payee requests agency collect (up to 9 months in exceptional circumstances) (7.3.2).


Services Australia will explain to parents how private collect arrangements interact with a payee’s FTB entitlement, and potential impacts on their entitlement if there are retrospective changes in the child support assessment (particularly if the payee becomes eligible for more child support) (FA Guide3.1.5.55) (CS Guide7.3.2).

FA Guide3.1.5.55Reasonable maintenance action completed - private collect


## Ending a child support assessment due to family & domestic violence


A payee can elect to end their child support assessment (2.6.2).


If a payee elects to end their child support case, Services Australia will end the assessment for children in the payee’s care and advise the payee they can reapply for a child support assessment at any time in the future.


If the payee is identified as at risk of family and domestic violence, they may be granted an exemption from the MAT (FA Guide3.1.5.70). A payee can elect to end their child support assessment whether or not a MAT exemption is granted.


When Services Australia accepts a payee's election to end a child support assessment due to the threat of family and domestic violence, details of why the case was ended will be recorded in their case records.


A payer who is at risk of, or experiencing family and domestic violence is not able to elect to end their child support assessment.


Policy reference:CS Guide2.6.2Electing to end an assessment


FA Guide3.1.5.70Exemptions from the maintenance action test


## Reporting threats of family & domestic violence


Services Australia will make a record of any conversation with a person threatening violence. The record may be required as evidence in court proceedings.


Where a person makes a threat against another person, including children, Services Australia will consider whether the matter should be reported to the police. Services Australia is not required to consult with a threatened person before reporting the matter to the police (CSRC Act section 16(3) and CSA Act section 150(3)).


The secrecy provisions in the child support legislation allow Services Australia to disclose the threat of family and domestic violence to the police. (CSRC Act section 16(3) and CSA Act section 150). The disclosure for the purposes of the child support legislation is necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the life, health, or welfare of a person to a relevant authority.

# 1.5.1 Australia's international maintenance arrangements


## Context


Arrangements commenced on 1 July 2000 that increased Australia's ability to give effect to its international obligations in relation to maintenance obligations arising from family relationship, parentage or marriage. The arrangements facilitated a change from court-based processes for overseas maintenance cases to predominantly administrative arrangements, and transferred responsibility for most child support (1.1.C.60) matters to the Registrar.


From 1 July 2000, the arrangements modified the operation of the CSA Act and the CSRC Act for cases where one parent resides abroad in a reciprocating jurisdiction while the other parent resides in Australia. The modifications were originally contained in regulations for both Acts but have since been incorporated into the primary legislation with effect from 19 July 2007.


The arrangements apply when the child lives with a parent (1.1.P.10) in Australia and also when the child lives with a parent in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10).


Act reference:Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Actsection 51 Legislative powers of the Parliament.

## Actions that may be taken by an overseas authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction


An overseas authority can give an application for an administrative assessment of child support to the Registrar and, in some circumstances, can apply for an assessment on behalf of a person. See2.1.1for more information.


If an overseas authority gives an application to the Registrar or makes an application on behalf of a person, the overseas authority may take certain prescribed actions for the person.


If an overseas authority gives an application to the Registrar, the overseas authority may take the prescribed actions with the person's consent (CSA Act section 29B(3)).


If an overseas authority makes an application on behalf of a person, the overseas authority may take the prescribed actions without the person's consent (CSA Act section 29B(2)).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 29B Applications by residents of reciprocating jurisdictions


## Prescribed actions


The following actions are prescribed by CSA Regs section 8:

• making an election of any kind under the CSA Act
• applying to the Registrar for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50)
• filing an application for leave to appeal to a court
• appealing against a decision to a court
• applying to court for a departure order
• lodging an objection to a decision
• applying to theARTfor review of a decision, and
• appealing a decision of the ART.

## Frequently asked questions


### What assistance does Services Australia provide for parents where the liability is administered overseas?


The Registrar provides assistance to the relevant overseas authority as required (for example, parent location, service of notices, and collecting the liability). The Registrar will direct enquiries about the administrative issues for an overseas liability to the overseas authority that issued the liability. The Registrar can also assist an Australian parent by transmitting any notifications or objections.


### Why are some reciprocating jurisdictions treated differently?


The Registrar cannot make or continue a child support assessment payable by a payer in Brunei Darussalam, Cook Islands, Israel, Niue, Papua New Guinea, the Yukon Territory of Canada and Samoa (previously Western Samoa) despite these countries being reciprocating jurisdictions. These countries have formally advised that under their laws, they can only commence maintenance proceedings on the basis of a court order.

TITLE: 1.4.2 How do child support payments interact with FTB?
WORD COUNT: 1909

The Guides to Social Policy Law is a collection of publications designed to assist decision makers administering social policy law.

# 1.4.2 How do child support payments interact with FTB?


## Context


The Child Support Scheme andFTBare closely linked to reflect the long-standing principle that parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children, with the Australian Government providing family assistance where needed.


The interactions between child support payments and FTB can affect how much FTB a person receives during an entitlement year, and may result in retrospective changes in a person's FTB entitlement if their child support assessment is updated for a past period.


This page explains the interactions. If a person wishes to discuss their individual circumstances in relation to FTB, they can contactServices Australiaon 136150.

• MAT for FTB Part A
• MIT for FTB Part A
• Impact of maintenance income estimation method on FTB Part A
• Impact of retrospective child support assessment changes on FTB Part A
• Impact of child support paid on FTB ATI

## How the Child Support Scheme interacts with FTB


The Child Support Scheme interacts with FTB through the:

• MATfor FTB Part A (FA Guide3.1.5) – applies to all parents who receive FTB Part A for a child from a previous relationship
• MITfor FTB Part A (FA Guide3.1.7) – applies to persons (payees) who receive child support
• FTBATI(FA Guide3.2.7) – a parent's (payer's)DCMEwill be considered when calculating their ATI.

Policy reference:FA Guide3.1.5Maintenance action test for FTB Part A,3.1.7Maintenance income test,3.2.7Deductible child maintenance expenditure


## MAT for FTB Part A


A separated parent who receives FTB Part A for a child from a former relationship must take 'reasonable maintenance action' in order to receive their full rate of FTB Part A (FA Guide3.1.5.30). Generally, this will involve applying for a child support assessment.


It is important to know that a parent can apply for an exemption from the MAT. There are a number of exemptions to the requirement that a person take reasonable maintenance action for a child (FA Guide3.1.5.70), including if a parent has a fear of family and domestic violence.


If a parent does not meet the MAT for a child, only the base rate of FTB Part A (FA Guide1.1.B.15) is payable in respect of the child, and the child is not included for rent assistance purposes.


FA Guide3.1.5provides information on the MAT. The MAT does not apply to non-parent carers.


Parents who have a senior secondary school child turning 18 are required to take reasonable action to obtain an extension of their child support assessment (FA Guide3.1.5.40).


Policy reference:FA Guide1.1.B.15Base FTB child rate,3.1.5Maintenance action test for FTB Part A,3.1.5.30Taking reasonable maintenance action,3.1.5.40Maintenance action in progress


## MIT for FTB Part A


The MIT may reduce the amount of FTB Part A a person is entitled to, based on the amount of child support they receive, or are entitled to receive.

• assesses whether an individual's maintenance income is greater than theirMIFA(FA Guide3.1.7.10), and
• reduces the rate of FTB Part A by 50c for every dollar of maintenance over the MIFA until the base rate (FA Guide1.1.B.10) is reached (the MIT only affects the amount of FTB Part A over the base rate).

Maintenance income is estimated during the financial year for people who receive FTB via instalments, as the actual amount assessed or received is not known until reconciliation occurs after the end of the financial year. The actual amount of maintenance received is assessed for past period claims.


If the parents have made a child support agreement, a 'notional assessment amount' is used in calculating the relevant amount of FTB Part A payable to the payee. Topic6.3and FA Guide3.1.7.14provides more information on the effect of notional assessments on FTB part A.


### Methods used to estimate maintenance income during a financial year


The methods used by Services Australia to estimate a payee's maintenance income depend on if the payee's child support assessment has a private collect or an agency collect arrangement.

• Private collect cases - the entitlement method is always used (FA Guide1.1.E.35).
• Agency collect cases – the payee has the choice of themodified entitlement method (FA Guide1.1.M.65), ordisbursement method (FA Guide1.1.D.100).
• modified entitlement method (FA Guide1.1.M.65), or
• disbursement method (FA Guide1.1.D.100).

The entitlement method is always used to estimate the maintenance income for private collect cases. In a private collect arrangement, the payee chooses the child support collection arrangement and has agreed that the parents are responsible for the transfer of child support. For this reason, in a private collect arrangement, all child support is deemed to be paid.


A payee with an agency collect arrangement can choose to have either the modified entitlement method or the disbursement method used to estimate their maintenance income.


The default method in agency collect cases is the modified entitlement method. Under the modified entitlement method, Services Australia will automatically switch between the entitlement method and the disbursement method depending on which method results in a higher MIT reduction.


A payee can ask Services Australia at any time to change their method to the disbursement method where they are receiving less child support than that estimated under the entitlement method.


Payees who have more than one agency collect case can nominate different methods for each case. A payee who has both a private collect case and an agency collect case can choose between the modified entitlement method and the disbursement method for their agency collect case, but must use the entitlement method for their private collect case.

## Impact of maintenance income estimation method on FTB Part A


The method used to estimate a payee's maintenance income has different impacts on their FTB Part A entitlement.


### Private collect – entitlement method


Services Australia will apply the payee's assessed child support entitlement to the FTB Part A MIT even if the amount of child support collected by the payee is less than what they are entitled to receive (FA Guide1.1.E.35).


At reconciliation, a payee's FTB Part A entitlement is reconciled based on the assessed amount of maintenance income for that entitlement (plus the family income test).


### Agency collect – modified entitlement method


Services Australia determines a payee's FTB Part A rate by using the estimated maintenance income worked out by applying the higher of the entitlement method and the disbursement method formula.


This means that Services Australia will use the method that produces the highest estimated maintenance income amount (FA Guide3.1.7.23). The modified entitlement method allows Services Australia to use a payee's assessed amount of child support, and update their estimated maintenance income if and when child support arrears are collected and paid. At reconciliation, a payee's FTB Part A entitlement is reconciled based on what the payee actually received during the financial year (and the family income test).


### Agency collect – disbursement method


The disbursement method (FA Guide3.1.7.22) may be appropriate where the payee does not know how much child support they are likely to receive, or if the amount paid by the payer is substantially less than they should be paying.


The payee must ask Services Australia for the disbursement method to be used, otherwise the modified entitlement method will be used.


The payee's rate of FTB Part A is recalculated each time the monthly amount of child support they receive from Services Australia changes. This means that their FTB rate can change every month.


The payee's estimated maintenance income is worked out by adding the amount of child support the payee has already received during the financial year to the amount projected for the rest of the relevant period. This second amount is worked out by multiplying the latest Services Australia monthly payment the payee has received (less any arrears) by the number of months left in the financial year.


The amount of estimated maintenance income for the financial year is then annualised when applying the MIT for the relevant period.


At reconciliation, a payee's FTB Part A entitlement is reconciled based on what the payee actually received during the financial year (and the family income test).


Policy reference:FA Guide1.1.E.35Entitlement method (FTB),3.1.7.22Maintenance income - disbursement method,3.1.7.23Maintenance income - modified entitlement method


## Impact of retrospective child support assessment changes on FTB Part A


If a child support assessment retrospectively changes (that is, because one party to the assessment lodges their tax returns), the payee's new rate of child support for that past period, may result in their FTB entitlement for a past period being re-reconciled (FA Guide6.4.2.30). This may result in an FTB debt or top-up payment.


The table below provides information on how a person's FTB entitlement is affected by a retrospective change in a child support assessment, by the collection type, and if the person's child support entitlement increases or decreases.


A higher child support entitlement can result in a higher MIT reduction and reduce a payee's FTB Part A entitlement for a past period.


The payee is deemed to have received the underpaid child support entitlement, even if the updated amount has not been paid by the payer. This may result in an FTB debt in respect of the year/s affected.


A lower child support entitlement can result in a lower MIT reduction and increase a person's FTB Part A entitlement.


The payee is deemed to have repaid the overpaid child support entitlement. This may result in an FTB top-up in respect of the year/s affected.


A higher child support entitlement for a past year will only be applied to the FTB Part A MIT in the financial year it is collected and paid to the payee.


This can result in an update to the payee's estimated maintenance income and result in a reduced rate of FTB Part A.


A higher estimated maintenance income may result in mandatory continuous adjustment (FA Guide4.3.1.30) during the year to offset the risk of an FTB debt and/or cause an FTB debt at reconciliation. A lower child support entitlement for a past year will reduce the payee's estimated maintenance income and be removed from the FTB Part A MIT in the financial year it is repaid.


This can result in an increase to their FTB and may result in a top-up at reconciliation.


Policy reference:FA Guide4.1.3.30Responsibilities of nominees,6.4.2.30FTB reconciliation due to maintenance income


## Impact of child support paid on FTB ATI


ATI is used in the FTB income tests when assessing a payer's eligibility for FTB Part A and FTB Part B (FA Guide3.2.1). A payer's ATI is reduced by 100% of their 'child maintenance expenditure' for that financial year. (FA Guide3.2.7).


Example:Mary has estimated that she will have taxable income of $36,500 for the income year. She estimates that she will pay $4,500 to her ex-partner as child maintenance. Mary's ATI for FTB purposes is $32,000 ($36,500 - $4,500).

# 1.5.3.10 Registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


## Context


The Registrar can register overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40) arising in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (1.5.1) for collection, in the same way that Australian court orders and child support assessments (1.1.C.70) can be registered.


## Types of registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


The Registrar can register certain overseas child maintenance liabilities and spousal maintenance liabilities for collection.The following are registrable overseas maintenance liabilities for a child:

• a maintenance order made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) requiring a person to pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) for the maintenance of their child or step-child
• a maintenance agreement registered by a judicial or administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction requiring a person to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of their child or step-child
• a maintenance assessment issued by an administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction requiring a parent (1.1.P.10) or step-parent to pay a periodic amount of maintenance for a child
• an agency reimbursement liability (that is, an amount that an overseas authority (1.1.O.30) has paid to the carer for which it seeks reimbursement from a parent)
• a penalty for late payment or incorrect estimate payable by a liable parent under New Zealand laws, and
• arrears (1.1.A.100) of periodic amounts of child maintenance payable under an overseas maintenance order, registered maintenance agreement, maintenance assessment or agency reimbursement liability (1.1.A.60).

The following are registrable overseas maintenance liabilities for a spouse:

• a maintenance order made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) requiring a person to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the person to whom they are or were married
• a maintenance agreement registered by a judicial or administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction requiring a person to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the person to whom they are or were married
• a maintenance assessment issued by an administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction requiring a person to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the person to whom they are or were married, and
• arrears of periodic amounts of spousal maintenance payable under an overseas maintenance order, registered maintenance agreement, or maintenance assessment.

See1.5.3.20for information about registering overseas maintenance liabilities for collection, as well as processes for overseas maintenance liabilities that are not registrable.

# 1.5.3.20 Registering overseas maintenance liabilities for collection


## Context


The Registrar can register a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (1.5.3.10) arising in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (1.5.1) for collection, in the same way that Australian child support assessments (1.1.C.70) and court orders can be registered.


The Registrar must register a registrable overseas maintenance liability within 90 days of receiving the application for registration.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25(2A) Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability


## On this page

• Application and registration requirements
• Preventing dual liabilities
• Terminating events for overseas maintenance liabilities
• Overseas maintenance liabilities that are not registrable

## Application & registration requirements


A payee (1.1.P.30) or payer (1.1.P.40) of an overseas maintenance liability may apply for registration of an overseas maintenance liability. The Registrar may only register an overseas maintenance liability if either the payee or the payer is a resident of Australia.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25C Limitation on inclusion of liabilities in Register


### A payee can apply


A payee can apply directly to the Registrar if:

• they are a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100), or
• they are a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, and the registrable overseas maintenance liability arises under an order made by, or registered in, a court of the same reciprocating jurisdiction.

If the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction an application for registration of a registrable overseas maintenance liability that arises under an order made by, or registered in, a court of the reciprocating jurisdiction may also be made by the payee and given to the Registrar by the overseas authority (1.1.O.30), or made by the overseas authority on behalf of the payee.


If the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction an application must be given to the Registrar by the overseas authority, or made by the overseas authority on behalf of the payee, if the registrable overseas maintenance liability does not arise under an order made by, or registered in, a court of the same reciprocating jurisdiction.


An overseas maintenance liability may arise under a court order made by another reciprocating jurisdiction that is not registered in a court of the payee’s reciprocating jurisdiction.


Overseas maintenance liabilities can also arise under administrative assessments (1.1.A.30) made by a reciprocating jurisdiction or agreements registered with a court or administrative authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction, whether or not those liabilities originate from the reciprocating jurisdiction of the payee.


An overseas authority that is seeking reimbursement from a parent (1.1.P.10) of the child, of amounts paid to a carer of the child for the child's maintenance (1.5.3.10), can apply as the payee in their own right. In this situation, the overseas authority applies for registration of an 'agency reimbursement liability' (1.1.A.60).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 18A Liability in relation to …, section 25 Application for registration of registerable maintenance liability


### A payer can apply


If the payer is a resident of:

• Australia, they can apply directly to the Registrar, provided the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.90)
• a reciprocating jurisdiction, they can apply directly to the Registrar or the overseas authority in their jurisdiction can give their application to the Registrar for them.

An application can be made to the Registrar for registration of an existing overseas maintenance liability, including arrears (1.1.A.100) payable under the liability. An application can also be made to the Registrar for registration of arrears only. However, arrears are only registrable if they have accrued as a result of a periodic liability.


The Registrar must not register an ongoing registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) that relates to a particular payer, payee and child/ren, if this is notified only after a later liability (that relates to the same individuals) has already been registered. However, the Registrar can register the arrears that arose under that earlier liability.


Example:Mohamed and Jana have one child, Ayesha. Mohamed successfully applied for a child support assessment for Ayesha against Jana on 1 April 2013. Jana informed the Registrar on 1 June 2013 that a court order was made for child support (1.1.C.60) between herself and Mohamed for Ayesha in the UK on 1 February 2009. Jana advised that they would like to apply to have the child support assessment replaced by the periodic amounts (1.1.P.80) set in the court order. The Registrar will refuse to register the ongoing periodic amounts set in the court order, as the Registrar only became aware of the court order after the child support assessment was made.


Mohamed applied to have the arrears from the court order registered. The Registrar will register any arrears that arose under the court order between 1 February 2009 and 31 March 2013.


The Registrar can refuse to register an overseas maintenance liability if the Registrar is satisfied that the liability arises in a manner that is inconsistent with the relevant international maintenance arrangement.


Example:Alicia lives in New Zealand and has a child support assessment made under the New Zealand child support system with her former partner, Alvin, who also lives in New Zealand. Alicia is the payee under the New Zealand assessment. Alicia moves to Australia to live with her children and applies to the Registrar to register the New Zealand assessment. Under the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Child and Spousal Maintenance, Australia has jurisdiction to make the child support assessment for Alicia, as the State where the payee habitually resides is responsible for assessing child support under the Agreement (1.5.2). Alicia instead applies for an Australian assessment, which can be registered and sent to the New Zealand child support authority for collection from Alvin.


A registered overseas maintenance liability, including an amount in arrears under such a liability, first becomes enforceable on the day on which the Registrar receives the application for the liability to be registered.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25 Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability, section 18A Liability in relation to registrable overseas maintenance liabilities, section 28 Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


## Preventing dual liabilities


The Registrar may have already registered a maintenance liability for the same payer, payee and child/ren. That previous liability ceases to have effect when a subsequent maintenance liability is registered, to the extent that it relates to that same child. The previous liability may continue to have effect in relation to another child who is not subject to the subsequent liability. Any arrears payable under the previous liability are still payable.


If the Registrar accepts an application for a child support assessment, and both parties are residents of Australia, any previously registered overseas maintenance liability will cease to have effect. Any arrears under the overseas maintenance liability will remain payable.


Act reference:CSRC Actsections 28 Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act, section 30AA Rule to avoid dual liabilities


CSA Actsection 152(2) Court order etc. to cease to have effect where child support becomes payable


## Terminating events for overseas maintenance liabilities


If both, or one of, the payee and/or payer of a registered overseas maintenance liability cease to be residents, or a resident, of Australia, the liability ends from the date that neither party is a resident of Australia (see the definition of a 'terminating event in relation to an enforceable maintenance liability' (1.1.E.30)).


If either the payee or the payer of a registered overseas maintenance liability ceases to be a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction and does not become a resident of another reciprocating jurisdiction or Australia, the liability ends from the date that party ceases to be a resident of the reciprocating jurisdiction.


Although in these cases the liability will cease to be enforceable in Australia by the Registrar, the liability may continue to be enforceable in the country where the liability arose.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 4(1)-‘terminating event’ (cb) to (cd)


## Overseas maintenance liabilities that are not registrable


A payee of an overseas maintenance liability that is not registrable can apply to the Registrar for the particulars of the liability to be entered in the Register. Overseas maintenance liabilities that are not registrable include lump sum spousal or child maintenance orders and other maintenance liabilities where a periodic amount is not specified, such as for the payment of insurance, medical or dental costs as they arise. Other maintenance liabilities may not be registrable, depending on the circumstances of the international maintenance arrangement on which the jurisdiction relies.


If an overseas maintenance liability is not registrable and the Registrar enters the particulars of the liability in the Register, amounts payable under it become a debt due to the applicant (payee), not the Commonwealth. The liability can be recovered in a court of competent jurisdiction, as if the liability were a court order made under Part VII or Part VIII of the FL Act. The payee can start their own enforcement proceedings, or they can ask the Attorney-General's Department to initiate proceedings on their behalf.

# 1.5.3.30 Overseas maintenance liabilities that cannot be registered


## Context


An overseas authority (1.1.O.30) may send the Registrar a provisional overseas maintenance order made in a court of their jurisdiction.


Authorities in the United States of America may also send the Registrar a United States petition (US petition). The Registrar cannot register a provisional order or a US petition until it is confirmed by an Australian court.


## On this page

• Provisional overseas maintenance order
• US petitions

## Provisional overseas maintenance order


An overseas authority may send the Registrar a provisional overseas maintenance order made in a court of their jurisdiction. The Registrar can only register a provisional overseas order if an Australian court confirms it. However, an Australian court cannot confirm a provisional order if an application for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) could properly be made.


If the Registrar is satisfied that an application for a child support assessment could properly be made, it will return the provisional order to the sending overseas authority. The Registrar will advise the overseas authority that it can accept:

• a request to register a final order made overseas
• a request to register an overseas maintenance assessment, or
• an application for a child support assessment.

If the Registrar is satisfied that an application for a child support assessment could not be properly made in relation to the case, it will refer a copy of the provisional order to the Attorney-General's Department. The Attorney-General's Department is responsible for making an application to an Australian court to have the provisional order confirmed. The Attorney-General's Department must serve a copy of the application upon the parent (1.1.P.10) in Australia (who is the respondent to the application). The respondent can oppose the application. The Registrar can register the confirmed provisional order, including any modifications that the Australian court may make.


Act reference:FL Regssection 102 Reciprocating jurisdictions, section 105 Provisional overseas maintenance orders …, section 106 Determination of Secretary’s application …, section 107 Effect of order …


CSRC Actsection 17 Liabilities in relation to children that are registrable maintenance liabilities


## US petitions


A US petition is not a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40). It is a petition (or application) for a support order filed in a court of a State or Territory of the United States of America. The Attorney-General's Department can make an application to an Australian court for a maintenance order in accordance with the terms set out in a US petition. However, a court in Australia cannot make an order on a US petition if an application for a child support assessment could properly be made.


If the Attorney-General's Department receives a US petition for parties who appear to be eligible for a child support assessment, it will refer the matter to the Registrar. The Registrar will advise the overseas authority that it can accept:

• a request to register a final order made overseas
• a request to register an overseas maintenance assessment, or
• an application for a child support assessment.

# 1.5.3.40 Overseas maintenance liabilities & changes in circumstances


## Context


The Registrar cannot vary an overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (1.5.3.10). This page explains the actions a parent (1.1.P.10) can take to account for changes in their circumstances.


## On this page

• Applying to an overseas judicial or administrative authority
• Applying for a child support assessment
• Applying to an Australian court

## Applying to an overseas judicial or administrative authority


Parents can apply to the judicial or administrative authority in the country where the overseas parent resides for variation of an overseas liability. Where the application is made directly to an overseas authority, the applicant parent may apply to the Registrar for assistance in transmitting the application for variation.


Act reference:CSRC Regssection 12 Transmission of variation claims to overseas authorities


## Applying for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70)


A registered overseas maintenance liability ceases to have effect in Australia when a child support assessment made under the CSA Act is registered. The overseas liability would no longer be enforceable in Australia (except for any arrears (1.1.A.100) for the period before the assessment). The liability may remain enforceable in the originating jurisdiction.


To minimise repeated new liabilities, the Registrar is able to refuse to accept an application for a child support assessment that would override an overseas maintenance liability already registered in relation to the same parties and child, where either party is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10).


An example of where the Registrar may exercise this discretion, is where the liability that is already registered was made in the jurisdiction in which the payee resides and it would be unreasonable to allow a child support assessment to override that liability. This may be relevant where the liability has recently been registered and the circumstances of the parties have not changed.


Note:If the application giving rise to the child support assessment is made by the parent by whom child support (1.1.C.60) is payable under that assessment, the liability will not be registered upon the making of the assessment. However, the payee (1.1.P.30)can subsequently apply for the child support assessment to be registered and where either the payer or the payee resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction, the payer may subsequently apply for the child support assessment to be registered.


Note:Where child support is payable under an overseas maintenance liability and child support later becomes payable under an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) under the CSA Act, the overseas maintenance liability will cease to have effect if the liable parent and other person are both residents of Australia.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A(2)(c) the application giving rise …, section 25(1) The payee of a registrable …, section 25(1C) If either the payer or the payee …, section 30AA Rules to avoid dual liabilities


CSA Actsection 30B Registrar may refuse …, section 152(2) Court order etc. to cease …


## Applying to an Australian court


Either parent can apply to an Australian court exercising family law jurisdiction for an order varying, discharging, suspending or reviving an overseas maintenance liability registered under the CSRC Act, if the liability originates from an overseas jurisdiction that is considered to be a reciprocating jurisdiction under Schedule 2 of the FL Regs. The Australian variation order is provisional if the original order was made in a jurisdiction specified under the FL Regs. A provisional order has no effect unless and until a court in the relevant reciprocating jurisdiction confirms it. If the overseas court confirms the provisional order (makes a final order) with or without modification, that final order has effect in Australia.


The following reciprocating jurisdictions are listed under FL Regs section 121:

• Brunei Darussalam
• a Canadian Province or Territory specified in an item of the table in Schedule 2
• Cook Islands
• Cyprus
• Fiji
• Gibraltar
• Hong Kong
• India
• Kenya
• Malawi
• Malaysia
• Malta
• Nauru
• New Zealand
• Papua New Guinea
• Republic of Ireland
• Sierra Leone
• Singapore
• South Africa
• Sri Lanka
• Tanzania (excluding Zanzibar)
• the Territory of Christmas Island
• the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands
• Trinidad and Tobago
• the United Kingdom, including Alderney, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey and Sark.

In other reciprocating jurisdictions not listed above, such as the United States of America, a parent can seek a variation to their liability in an Australian court, and the Registrar can give effect to that variation as a final order. However, the overseas jurisdiction from which the liability originates may not recognise the Australian variation and, if so, arrears will continue to accrue under the original liability in the overseas jurisdiction. For this reason, it may be preferable for a parent with a liability from such jurisdictions to seek a variation in the jurisdiction that made the original liability.


The Registrar will vary the Register entry to give effect to a final court order, or a confirmed provisional order.


In instances where a party who wishes to vary, suspend or discharge a maintenance liability made by a jurisdiction that is not considered to be a reciprocating jurisdiction under Schedule 2 of the FL Regs, that party may apply to the Child Support Registrar to have their claim transmitted to the foreign jurisdiction.


Act reference:FL Regssection 119 Party in Australia may apply …, section 121 Status of variation etc. order, section 122 Provisional variation etc. order must be confirmed …, Schedule 2—Reciprocating jurisdictions etc.

# 1.6.1 Australian residence - parent or non-parent carer


## Context


The Registrar must determine if a parent is a resident of Australia (1.1.A.100) in order to determine, among other things:

• whether an application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) is properly made and able to be accepted (2.1.1)
• whether the appropriate income rules are being used to determine an assessment (2.2)
• whether an overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) can be registered (1.5.3.20), and
• whether a terminating event has occurred (2.6.3).

The Registrar applies the same tests as theATOwhen deciding if a person is a resident of Australia for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 10-'resident of Australia', section 12 Interpretation—happening of child support terminating events, section 25 Persons who may apply—parents, section 25A Persons who may apply—non-parent carers


CSRC Actsection 4(1)-‘resident of Australia’


## On this page

• Resident of Australia
• Australian resident leaving Australia

## Resident of Australia


A person is a 'resident of Australia' for child support purposes if they are a resident of Australia for the purposes of the IncomeTax Assessment Act 1936.


The primary test of if a person is a resident of Australia is whether the person resides in Australia. Where a person has always lived in Australia and continues to live in Australia they will clearly be a resident of Australia. From 1 July 2016, this includes a resident of Norfolk Island, the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands or the Territory of Christmas Island.


For the purposes of the CSRC Act only, the definition of a resident of Australia does not include a person who is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10). See1.6.3for more information about when a person is considered to be a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 4 Objects of Act, section 10-'resident of Australia'


CSRC Actsection 4(1)-‘resident of Australia’


Income Tax Assessment Act 1936section 6(1)-‘resident of Australia’


## Australian resident leaving Australia


Where a person who was an Australian resident leaves Australia, the Registrar will consider whether the person continues to be a resident of Australia according to:

• the ordinary meaning of 'resident'
• the statutory domicile test, or
• the statutory superannuation test.

### Ordinary meaning of 'resident' - resident leaving Australia


The word 'resides' has its ordinary meaning for this test. The Macquarie Dictionary defines 'reside' as 'to dwell permanently or for a considerable time; have one's abode for a time'. When considering whether a person has ceased to be a resident of Australia according to the ordinary meaning of the word 'resides', the Registrar will take into account the person's intention in going overseas and the length of their intended stay overseas. A person who usually resides in Australia but is overseas on holidays continues to reside in Australia during their absence.


Where it is not clear that the person who has left Australia continues to be a resident of Australia according to ordinary concepts of residency, the statutory tests will be considered.


### Statutory domicile test


A person whose domicile is in Australia continues to be a resident of Australia unless their permanent place of abode is outside Australia.


A person acquires a domicile of origin at birth which is the domicile of their parents. A person whose domicile is Australia will maintain their Australian domicile unless they acquire a different domicile by choice or by operation of law.


Generally, a person will have acquired a new 'domicile of choice' in a particular country if:

• they are legally present in a country, and
• they have formed an intention to remain in that country for the foreseeable future, and for a period that they regard as indefinite.

A person will generally not have acquired a new 'domicile of choice' in a country if:

• they intend to leave the country in the foreseeable future, for example on the completion of a contract of employment or other project, or
• they intend to return to their country of origin on the occurrence of some definite future event, such as retirement (even if the timing for their retirement is distant and uncertain).

However, a willingness to move to another country if better opportunities present themselves, or a hope of returning to one's homeland at some unspecified time in the future, will not defeat an intention to acquire a new domicile of choice.


Generally, for the Registrar to be satisfied that a person has acquired a new domicile of choice, the person needs to have demonstrated by their actions that they genuinely do have an intention to reside in the new country indefinitely, for example, obtaining a migration visa or citizenship in the new country.


If a person's domicile is outside Australia they will not be considered to be a resident of Australia under this test, and there is no need to consider their 'permanent place of abode', which is the second part of the test. If the person's domicile is Australia, their permanent place of abode needs to be considered.


Permanent place of abode


A permanent place of abode does not have to be 'everlasting' or 'forever'. A person who intends to return to live in Australia in the foreseeable future can still set up a 'permanent place of abode' elsewhere. If a person whose domicile is in Australia is residing elsewhere, the Registrar will take into account the following factors when deciding if that other country is their permanent place of abode:

• The intended and actual length of the person's stay in the overseas country; as a broad rule of thumb a period of 2 years or more may be regarded by the ATO as a substantial period for the purposes of a person's stay in another country. However, the duration of a person's actual or intended stay overseas is not of itself conclusive, and must be considered in conjunction with the other factors listed.
• The person's intention to return to Australia at some definite point in time or to travel to another country; generally if a person has an intention of returning to Australia at the end of a 'transitory' stay overseas, they will not be considered to have established a permanent place of abode outside Australia. Whether a stay overseas is 'transitory' depends on the circumstances of the case, but as a general rule of thumb a stay of less than 2 years may be considered 'transitory'.
• Whether the person has established a home outside Australia; if a person has established his or her home in an overseas country (for example, purchased a house or apartment to live in or entered into a long-term lease on a home), this would tend to show the place of abode in the overseas country is permanent.
• Whether the person has abandoned their residence or place of abode in Australia; if a person maintains a home in Australia that is available for them to live in while they are outside Australia, it may tend to suggest (in conjunction with other factors) that the person remains resident in Australia. If a person has sold or rented out their home in Australia it may tend to suggest that the person has established a permanent place of abode overseas.
• The duration and continuity of the person's presence in the overseas country; if a person has no fixed or habitual place of abode overseas but moves, for example, from one country to another, this may tend to suggest that the person has not established a permanent place of abode outside Australia.
• The durability of the person's association with a particular place in Australia; it is not necessary for a person to close all Australian bank accounts in order to establish a permanent place of abode overseas. For example, if a person closes their 'everyday use' accounts in Australia but maintains a long term investment account in Australia, it is still possible to establish, on the basis of other factors, that the person has a permanent place of abode outside Australia. If a person's children are enrolled at and attend school in the overseas country, this may tend to suggest that the person has established a permanent place of abode overseas. However, if a person's children continue their schooling in Australia despite the presence of adequate educational facilities in the overseas country this would tend to show that the person has not established a permanent place of abode outside Australia.

The weight to be given to each factor will vary with individual circumstances of each case and no single factor will be decisive.


## Superannuation test


This test applies to current Australian Government employees. The test states that a person is a resident of Australia if the person is:

• an eligible employee under theSuperannuation Act 1976, or
• a member of the superannuation scheme established under theSuperannuation Act 1990.

The test is designed to ensure that Australian Government employees working at Australian posts overseas are still Australian residents for tax purposes. If a person is a resident of Australia under this test, the person's spouse and any children under 16 years are also Australian residents for income tax purposes.


The effect of this test is that current Australian Government employees who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme created by the Superannuation Act 1976 or the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme created by the Superannuation Act 1990 are residents of Australia.


A person working overseas and who is not a current Australian Government employee is not a resident of Australia pursuant to this test.


This test does not deem a person who is a member of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme created by theSuperannuation Act 2005to be a resident of Australia.


## Non-resident entering Australia


Where a person who was not previously a resident of Australia enters Australia, the Registrar will consider whether the person has become a resident of Australia according to:

• the ordinary meaning of 'resident,' or
• the statutory 183 day test.

### Ordinary meaning of 'resident' - Non-resident entering Australia


When considering whether a person who was not previously a resident of Australia has become a resident of Australia according to the ordinary meaning of the word 'resides' the Registrar will take into account:

• the person's intention or purpose of presence in Australia and overseas. For example, a migrant who comes to Australia intending to reside here permanently is a resident from arrival. A person who has travelled to Australia for a holiday will generally not be a resident of Australia.
• the person's family and business/employment ties in Australia and overseas. For example, a person who is in Australia for employment or education purposes is more likely to be considered a resident of Australia.
• the location of the person's assets and the arrangements they have made to maintain them.
• the person's social and living arrangements in Australia and overseas. Arrangements that may indicate that a person is residing in Australia may include joining sporting or community organisations, enrolling children in school, or committing to a residential lease.
• the period the person has been physically present in Australia. In most cases a visit of less than 6 months is not a sufficient time to consider that a person is residing in Australia.

The weight given to each factor will vary according to the circumstances of the individual.


### 183 day test


Under this test, a person who is actually present in Australia for more than half the income year (that is, Australian financial year), whether continuously or intermittently, is a resident of Australia unless:

• the person's usual place of abode is outside Australia, and
• the person has no intention to take up residence in Australia.

Note:The phrase 'usual place of abode' does not have the same meaning as 'permanent place of abode'. The terms 'usual' and 'abode' should be given their ordinary and natural meanings.


The Macquarie Dictionary gives the following definitions:

• 'usual' means habitual or customary, and
• 'abode' means a dwelling place; a habitation.

The 183 day test must be applied to each income year separately, and for that reason it cannot be used to determine a person's residency status beyond the end of the particular income year being considered.

# 1.6.2 Residence & citizenship - child


## Context


The Registrar can make or continue a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) for a child who meets the residence and citizenship requirements of the CSA Act. These requirements are modified if the payee (1.1.P.30) or payer (1.1.P.40) is in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (1.5.1).


## Act references


CSA Actsection 12, section 24


Australian Citizenship Act 2007


## Residency & citizenship for child support purposes


A person can apply for a child support assessment for an eligible child who is under 18 years of age and not a member of a couple (1.1.M.10) and who is (CSA Act section 24(1)):

• present in Australia on the day the application is made, and/or
• an Australian citizen, or ordinarily resident in Australia on the day the application is made.

This requirement does not apply if the payee (including if the payee is a non-parent carer) is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (CSA Act section 24(2)).


Unless an international maintenance arrangement (CSRC Act section 4(1)) applies in respect of a child (CSA Act section 12(4A)(a)), a terminating event occurs for the child if the child no longer meets any of the following requirements (CSA Act section 12(1)(f)):

• the child is present in Australia
• the child is an Australian citizen
• the child is ordinarily a resident in Australia.

## Present in Australia


This term has its ordinary meaning. It means physically present in Australia.


## Australian citizen


Australian citizenship can be acquired automatically or by application and there are also circumstances where a person ceases to be an Australian citizen. Provisions relating to citizenship are contained in theAustralian Citizenship Act 2007, to which the Registrar will have regard when making decisions on a child’s citizenship for child support assessment purposes.


## Ordinarily a resident in Australia


This term also has its ordinary meaning. It applies to a child who is not physically present in Australia, but who usually lives here. The Registrar will take into account the same factors that it considers when deciding whether a parent resides in Australia (that is, in the ordinary meaning of that term, see1.6.1for further information).

# 10.2.3 Decisions made under the CSRC Act to which a person may object


## Context


A payer (1.1.P.40) or payee (1.1.P.30) may object to certain decisions made under the CSRC Act. In limited cases an employer can object to certain decisions made under the CSRC Act.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 4, section 79D, section 80


## Objection rights & processes


Objections can be lodged to the following decisions made by the Registrar under the CSRC Act:

• a decision to register or refuse to register a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40)
• a decision to refuse to enter the particulars of a liability
• a decision about the particulars of a registrable maintenance liability entered in the Register
• a decision to vary or refuse to vary the particulars in the Register
• a decision to delete an entry from the Register
• a decision to credit all or part of a non-agency payment under section 71, 71A or 71C of the Act (payee only) (7.5.1)
• a decision to refuse to credit all or part of a non-agency payment, under section 71, 71A or 71C of the Act (7.5.1)
• a decision to refuse an election that employer deductions not be made
• a decision to refuse to grant an application for collection of arrears (1.1.A.100) for more than 3 months
• a decision to refuse an election to end collection of child support (1.1.C.60) by the Registrar
• a decision to refuse an election to have child support collected by the Registrar
• a decision to refuse an overall non-care period
• a decision to make deductions fromFTBpayments to repay child support debts or carer debts
• a decision to start or refuse to start a low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4)
• a decision which results in failure to collect an amount payable that has been unpaid for 6 months if legal proceedings have not commenced for recovery of the amount or proceedings have commenced and at least 3 months has elapsed since the proceedings were commenced (payee only), and
• a refusal to remitLPPs (1.1.L.20) imposed on payers.

An employer can object to a decision made by the Registrar under the CSRC Act to refuse to remit late payment penalties imposed on employers.


CSRC Act section 26 sets out the particulars that the Registrar must enter in the Child Support Register in relation to each liability. As noted above, a parent may object to a decision to vary or refuse to vary those particulars. For example, following a Registrar-initiated decision to end collection (7.4.1.40).


The particulars entered in the Register include the following:

• details of the child support assessment, court order or maintenance agreement (including matters such as the name of the parents, the periodic amount and the basis of the liability)
• details of the payment period (1.1.P.50) and the payment rate (including the initial period, payment period and rate of payment)
• details of the enforcement period and any suspension of the liability, and
• any other particulars that the Registrar chooses to include (such as the daily rate or statement concerning employer withholdings).

The Registrar can use CSRC Act section 42 to correct errors rather than requiring parents or non-parent carers to use the objection process, but is not obliged to do so in every case. See11.3for further information.

# 10.1 The stages of seeking review of a decision made by the Registrar


## Context


The first stage of seeking review of a decision made by the Registrar is usually to lodge an objection (1.1.O.10) to the decision. An objection is an internal review process conducted by Services Australia. See10.2for further information on the objections process.


Objection decisions made by the Registrar may be appealable to theART(1.1.A.40) for external merits review. See10.3for further information on the process for external reviews at the ART.


Decisions made by the ART may be appealed to a court on a question of law. The courts also have jurisdiction to make a range of orders that may affect a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) or other liability (including decisions made by the Registrar under the CSA Act and the CSRC Act). See10.4for further information about court applications, appeals and orders.

# 10.2.2 Decisions made under the CSA Act to which a person may object


## Context


A parent or non-parent carer may object to certain decisions under the CSA Act.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 80, section 80A


CSA Actsection 54K, section 54L


## On this page


A parent or non-parent carer may object to particular decisions made under the CSA Act. A person generally cannot apply to theARTfor review of a decision unless they have already objected to that decision. In most cases, a person cannot apply to court about a child support assessment unless they have already objected to a decision about that assessment and have also sought review by the ART.


CSRC Act section 80(1) provides that parties to an assessment can object to the following decisions by the Registrar that were made under the CSA Act:

• A decision to accept an application for assessment(unless the ground of objection is that the person is not the parent of the child).
• A decision to refuse to accept an application for assessment(unless one of the reasons for refusal was that the Registrar was not satisfied that a person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child is a parent of the child).
• A decision as to the particulars of a child support assessment.
• A decision as to the particulars of a notional child support assessment.
• A decision to make or refuse to make a determination under CSA Act Part 6A (change of assessment).
• A decision to accept or refuse to accept a child support agreement.
• A decision to terminate a limited child support agreement.
• A decision to refuse to accept an election of a new year to date income for an income estimate.
• A decision to determine a new year to date income for an income estimate.
• A decision to refuse to remit an estimate penalty in whole or part.

CSRC Act section 80A provides that parties to an assessment can object to a care percentage decision made under the CSA Act. See10.2.8for more information.


An objection may not be required to correct an obvious error in an assessment. Refer to2.5.4for more information.


## A decision to accept an application for assessment


A parent who is assessed in respect of the costs of the child can object to the Registrar's decision to accept an application for a child support assessment. The objection can be on any grounds other than the ground that the person is not a parent of the child (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 9 and section 80(4)).


Example:The Registrar accepts Maria's application for an assessment of child support for their child Varinia, payable by Ricarda.


Ricarda advises the Registrar that they do not accept that they are Varinia's parent.


Ricarda can't object to the Registrar's decision to accept the application for assessment. Their objection is on the basis that they are not a parent of the child concerned.


Example:The Registrar accepts Cyrus's application for an assessment for child support for their child Mathilda, payable by Yasar.


Yasar advises the Registrar that they do not believe they should have to pay child support for Mathilda, who is aged 17, as the child is living in a de facto relationship.


Yasar can object to the Registrar's decision to accept the application for assessment. The ground of their objection is that Mathilda is not an eligible child as they are a member of a couple.


Where a parent who has been assessed in respect of the costs of the child wishes to contest the decision to accept an application for assessment on the grounds of parentage, they can apply to a court under CSA Act section 107 (10.4.2) for a declaration that they should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because they are not a parent of the child (Bixby and Farraday (SSAT Appeal)(2009) FMCAfam 647).


The Registrar may suspend payments to the payee while the Registrar considers the payer's objection to the validity of a child support assessment for reasons other than the parentage of the child concerned. See10.2.9for more information on suspending payments to payees.


If there is an obvious administrative error in a decision to accept an application for assessment, the Registrar may be able to correct the decision without the need for court action.


Example:The Registrar accepts Arlene's application for an assessment for child support for their child Alan, payable by Valentin but was not able to contact Valentin. The Registrar based the decision on a statutory declaration from Arlene that Valentin was named on the birth certificate as a parent of Alan.


Valentin subsequently contacts the Registrar and contradicts Arlene's claim about the birth certificate. The Registrar later confirms that Valentin is not named on the certificate and that the declaration was false. The Registrar can correct this error, Valentin does not need to apply to court for a declaration under section 107.


## A decision to refuse to accept an application for assessment


An applicant can object to the Registrar's decision to refuse to accept their application for an administrative assessment unless one of the reasons for refusal was that the Registrar was not satisfied that the person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child is a parent of the child (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 10 and section 80(5)).


If an applicant disagrees with the Registrar's decision to refuse their application because the Registrar is not satisfied that the person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child, they can apply to a court under CSA Act section 106A (10.4.2) for a declaration that the person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child. If a court grants the declaration, the Registrar is taken to have accepted the application for assessment (CSA Act section 106A(6)(a)).


If there was more than one reason for refusing the application, the applicant can apply to a court for a declaration that they are entitled to have the Registrar reconsider the application because the person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the child is a parent of the child. If the declaration is granted, then the Registrar must reconsider the application (section 106A(6)(b)).


If there is an obvious administrative error in a decision to refuse an application for assessment, the Registrar may be able to correct the decision without the need for court action.


Example:The Registrar refuses Viviane's application for an assessment for child support for her child Thaddeus, payable by Vlad. The application is refused because Viviane did not provide the necessary evidence to satisfy the presumption of parentage (2.1.3) rules.


Viviane subsequently contacts the Registrar and advises the evidence was sent to the Registrar 2 days before the application was refused. The Registrar confirms that the evidence was received before the decision was made but administrative delays prevented the decision maker from considering it. The Registrar can correct this error, and Viviane does not need to apply to court for a declaration under section 106A.


## A decision as to the particulars of a child support assessment


Parents and non-parent carers can object to the Registrar's decision about the particulars of their administrative assessment (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 11), except for care percentage decisions made for periods after 1 July 2010 where the objection is made under section 80A.


The particulars of a child support assessment are the other elements of the child support formula including:

• theATIof each parent (this includes a parent's estimate of their ATI)
• the child support income of each parent
• the self-support amount of each parent
• the income percentage of each parent
• the care percentage of each parent (for periods before 1 July 2010)
• the cost percentage of each parent
• the child support percentage of each parent
• the costs of each child
• the annual rate of child support.

Example:Effie disagrees with the Registrar's decision to reduce the child support assessment because Helene has lodged an estimate of income. Effie can object to the Registrar's decision because it is a decision in relation to a particular of the assessment that is, the ATI of Helene, the parent who lodged the estimate.


Example:Fred disagrees with the amount of child support the Registrar worked out in accordance with their child support agreement with Cherie. Fred can object to this decision because it is a decision in relation to the annual rate of child support, a particular of the assessment.


## A decision as to the particulars of a notional child support assessment


Parents and any non-parent carers can object to the Registrar's decision about the particulars of their notional assessment (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 14A). There are no review rights in relation to a provisional notional assessment (6.3), as either party can ask for certain variations to the provisional notional assessment. Once a provisional notional assessment has become a notional assessment (6.3), an objection can be made to the particulars of the notional assessment.


## A decision to make or refuse to make a determination under CSA Act Part 6A (change of assessment)


A parent or non-parent carer can object to the Registrar's decision to make a change of assessment decision or to refuse to make a change of assessment decision (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 15). The person who objects does not have to be the person who applied for the change of assessment.


## A decision to accept or refuse to accept a child support agreement


A party to a child support agreement can object to the Registrar's decision to accept or refuse to accept an application for acceptance of the child support agreement (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 14).


## A decision to terminate a limited child support agreement


A party to a limited child support agreement can object to the Registrar's decision to terminate their agreement if the decision to terminate resulted from an election to terminate the agreement being lodged by one of the parties to the agreement (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 13). The election to terminate may have been made because the notional assessment (6.3) was varied by more than 15% or because the agreement was made 3 or more years prior to the election to terminate.


## To refuse to accept an election of a new year to date income for an income estimate


A parent who makes an income estimate for part of a financial year must provide a year to date income amount when making the estimate election (CSA Act section 60(3)(b)). If the parent later becomes aware that the year to date income amount provided is inaccurate, they can elect a new year to date income amount (CSA Act section 63AC). The Registrar may refuse to accept the election for a new year to date income amount (CSA Act section 63AD). The parent can object to the Registrar's decision to refuse the election (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 11A).


## To determine a new year to date income for an income estimate


A parent who makes an income estimate for part of a financial year must provide a year to date income amount when making the estimate election (CSA Act section 60(3)(b)). If the Registrar later becomes aware that the year to date income amount is incorrect, the Registrar may determine another amount to replace the year to date income amount (CSA Act section 63AE). The parent can object to the Registrar's determination of the year to date income (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 11B).


## A decision to refuse to remit an estimate penalty in whole or part


A parent who requests the Registrar remit their estimate penalty can object to the Registrar's decision in relation to the remission of that estimate penalty (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 12).

TITLE: 1.6.3 Resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction

The Guides to Social Policy Law is a collection of publications designed to assist decision makers administering social policy law. The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 1.6.3 Resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction


## Context


In some circumstances it is necessary for the Registrar to determine whether a person is a resident of a country other than Australia. In these cases the decision needs to be made using ordinary concepts in relation to residency.


## Act references


## Reciprocating jurisdiction residency


The CSA Act and the CSRC Act provide for certain actions to be taken where a person is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10). More information about Australia's international maintenance arrangements is provided at1.5.1.


## Australian residency statutory tests


The tests that apply specifically to whether a person is a resident of Australia for tax purposes (that is, domicile test, 183 day rule test and superannuation test) cannot be used to determine whether a person is a resident of a country other than Australia.


See1.6.1for more information about those tests.


## Dual resident


In some circumstances it may be possible for a person to be a resident of Australia for tax purposes (using the statutory tests) but at the same time 'habitually resident' in another country. In that case, the person will be considered to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the CSA Act, but cannot be considered to be a resident of Australia for the purposes of the CSRC Act (CSRC Act section 4).


Example:Emily leaves Australia to work in Singapore. She has a one-year contract, after which she plans to return to Australia to resume work here. While in Singapore she lives with a family who treats her as one of their own and she participates in all her usual social and work-related activities in Singapore.


Under ordinary concepts of residency, Emily may be considered to be resident in Singapore, as that is where she is living and is settled for a period of time. However, she may also still be an Australian resident for tax purposes under the domicile test, as her domicile is in Australia and her permanent place of abode remains in Australia.

# 10.2.1 Overview of objections


## Context


The objection provisions allow parents (1.1.P.10) and non-parent carers to ask the Registrar to reconsider particular decisions made under both the CSA Act and CSRC Act. This means that parents and non-parent carers have the opportunity for internal administrative review of some decisions. The review is conducted by an officer from Services Australia who was not involved in making the original decision.


The Child Support Registrar, or an officer with appropriate delegation (11.1), makes decisions by determining facts and then applying the law to those facts. The Registrar will make reasonable investigations before making any decision and give each parent the opportunity to comment on information that may be taken into account in a way that adversely affects them. New information about the circumstances of the parents or the child may become available after the Registrar has made a decision.


## Act references


CSRC ActPart VII, section 42

• Objection provisions

## Correction of error or mistake


There are circumstances where an assessment can be amended without going through the objection (1.1.O.10) process.


If there is an obvious factual or clerical error (such as a date of birth, arithmetic or keying error) the Registrar may amend the assessment and/or vary the Child Support Register to correct the error or mistake (CSA Act section 75, CSRC Act section 42). Occasionally, a more complex error may occur that the parents are not fully aware of. The Registrar may consider if these errors can be corrected without using the objection process.


The Registrar is not obliged to consider correcting an error. If the Registrar considers correcting an error, the Registrar must either decide to correct the error or decide to not correct the error. See11.3for further information about error correction.


## Objection provisions


Reconsideration of a decision is not the same as a correction of an error or mistake. A parent may lodge an objection if they want the Registrar to reconsider a decision and change an assessment or an entry in the Child Support Register. Circumstances where it would be appropriate to lodge an objection to the Registrar's original decision may include if the facts are not clear, if there is new information that one parent has not had an opportunity to comment upon, or if there is a dispute about the facts. In some cases, a parent who failed to provide information to the Registrar before the original decision was made may be able to make a new application based on the relevant information (for example, a new change of assessment application). Otherwise, the parent may object to the original decision and the Registrar will take that new information into account when considering the objection.


If parents believe that the Registrar has made a mistake of fact and/or applied the law incorrectly they may object to that decision.


If a parent lodges an objection, the Registrar must reconsider the original decision, taking into account any relevant new information.


Example:David (payer) asks the Registrar to credit an amount paid for their child's school fees against the ongoing child support liability for that child. David provides copies of receipts. Elise (payee) confirms that David has paid the school fees. The Registrar credits the payment.


Elise contacts Services Australia 2 weeks later and questions whether the payment should have been credited. Elise says that David was ordered to pay the school fees by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia as part of their property settlement. Services Australia tells Elise that the Registrar cannot now vary the decision to take that information into account and Elise needs to object to the original decision.


## Withdrawing an objection


A parent objecting to a decision may withdraw their objection at any time before the decision has been made. A withdrawal request can be made verbally or in writing. If a parent elects to withdraw their objection, the Registrar will not be required to make an objection decision, unless the other party has also objected to the same decision and requests for the review to continue. If either party wishes to lodge a new objection, they may be required to seek an extension of time.

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 1.6.4 Habitual residency under the Australia-New Zealand agreement


## Context


The Australian and New Zealand governments entered into an agreement to facilitate the collection of liabilities under administrative assessments (1.1.A.30) of child support from 1 July 2000 (see1.5.2for more information about this agreement). Under the agreement, the contracting state where the payee (1.1.P.30) is habitually resident (1.1.H.10) will issue and administer the assessment, and the other contracting state where the payer (1.1.P.40) resides will be responsible for collection.


## Habitual residence


Habitual residence is a term used in many international instruments and is used specifically in the Australia and New Zealand agreement to define each country's jurisdiction. It is intended to be a simple non-technical term, applied to the facts of each case. A person's country of habitual residence is the country in which a person usually lives. 'Residence' means more than presence, as it refers to a place where a person resides or lives for a settled period. 'Habitual' indicates that something more than occasional or short-term residence is required, but continuous presence is not required. A person who is present in a country as a tourist or in transit is not habitually resident in that country.

• Mehrdad arrived in Australia recently and stated on their entry documents that they intended to establish themselves in Australia. Mehrdad is considered to be a habitual resident of Australia from the entry date.
• Crystal has been living in New Zealand for 8 months and appears to have no immediate intention to leave the jurisdiction. Crystal is considered to be a habitual resident of New Zealand.
• Ari arrived in New Zealand for a 1-month holiday and intends to return to his home in Australia when his holidays ends. Ari is not considered to be a habitual resident of New Zealand.

# 10.2.4 Can an objection decision be made?


## Context


The Registrar must make an objection (1.1.O.10) decision if a parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer lodges an objection that meets certain requirements.


## Act references


CSRC Regssection 31, section 34, section 35


Evidence Act 1995section 160, section 163


## On this page


The information in this section applies to objections to decisions other than care percentage (1.1.C.20) decisions. See10.2.8for information about objections to care percentage decisions.


The Registrar must make an objection decision where an objection is lodged that is:

• in writing
• from a person who may object against a decision which carries objection rights, and
• lodgedwithin 28 daysof the day that the parent received notice of the decision (or 90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.6.3)(1.1.R.10)).

If a person does not object in time they can apply for an extension of time. See10.2.5for more information.


If the above criteria are not met, the Registrar cannot make an objection decision. Services Australia will contact parents regarding any applications that do not meet these criteria.


## In writing


An objection must be in writing from a person who may object to the decision (CSRC Act section 80(1)). The Registrar cannot act on a verbal request to reconsider the original decision. A written objection can be lodged by mail, email or in person.


It is not necessary for the person to use the word 'objection' in their written objection, but they must ask the Registrar to reconsider the original decision.


## From a person who may object against a decision which carries objection rights


CSRC Act section 80(1) specifies who may object and which decisions they may object against. Information about who may object to specified decisions under the CSA Act is included in10.2.2. Information about who may object to specified decisions under the CSRC Act is included in10.2.3.


A person who may object must lodge their own objection unless it is made on their behalf by someone with power of attorney or with statutory rights to deal with the parent's finances (such as a State Trustee). Another person who is otherwise authorised to act as the representative of a person who may object (including a solicitor) may not write an objection on behalf of the person who may object unless the person who may object signs the objection. For more information, see11.4.6. There are also particular requirements with regard to representation in the process for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) application and these requirements apply to the process for an objection to a change of assessment decision (5.6.1).


If the parent resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction the relevant overseas authority (1.1.O.30) can object on behalf of the parent if (CSA Regs section 8):

• an application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) has been made by the overseas authority on behalf of the parent, or
• an application for administrative assessment has been made by the parent and given to the Registrar by the overseas authority, and the parent consents to the overseas authority objecting on his or her behalf.

Occasionally, there will be an error in a decision to which there are no objection rights, for example a decision about presumption of parentage. In these cases, the Registrar may be able to correct the error without using the objection process. Refer to10.2.1and10.2.2for more details.


A person cannot object about service provision or the legislation. Services Australia's complaints policy applies to those cases.


## Within 28 days (or 90 days for residents of reciprocating jurisdictions)


An objection to a decision must be lodged within 28 days of the day that the parent was served with written notice of that decision (CSRC Act section 81(1)). If the decision is an appealable collection refusal (10.2.3) decision, the payee (1.1.P.30) may object to it within 28 days of the date they first became aware of the decision (CSRC Act section 81(2)).


The period for lodging an objection to any decision is extended from 28 days to 90 days for a parent who is resident overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction while the other parent resides in Australia (CSRC Act section 81(3)).


When deciding whether an objection has been lodged in time, the Registrar will firstly calculate the date upon which the person was served with notice of the decision. The Registrar usually serves notices by pre-paid mail sent to the person at his or her last known address (CSRC Regs section 31(1)). A person is taken to have been served with notice by mail at the time when the letter would, in the ordinary course of the post, have arrived at the place to which it was addressed, unless proven otherwise (CSRC Regs section 31(1)).


The last address notified by the person to the Registrar is for all purposes that person's address for service (CSRC Regs section 34(1)). If the person has not notified the Registrar of his or her address but the Registrar records nevertheless contain an address for the person, the last such address in the Registrar records is the person's address for service (CSRC Regs section 34(2)). If the person failed to advise the Registrar of a change to his or her address, the notice is taken to have been served despite it being sent to his or her former address (CSRC Regs section 35).


The Registrar will presume that a notice has been posted to a person on the fifth business day after the date the notice was produced (Evidence Act section 163). The Registrar will presume that the letter was received at the person's address in Australia on the seventh working day after the date it was presumed to have been posted (Evidence Act section 160). This means that in most cases, a notice is presumed to have been served on a person on the twelfth working day after the date of the notice (that is, excluding any day that is a Saturday, Sunday, bank or public holiday).


The only exceptions are where the Registrar is aware that the person received the notice within a shorter period, or where the notice is sent to a person at an overseas address. The Registrar may be aware that the person received the notice within a shorter period if a copy of the notice was sent to the person by electronic means; or if the person contacted Services Australia before the ninth working day after the date of the notice to discuss it when he or she received it. If the notice was sent to the person at an overseas address, the Registrar will investigate the usual postage period for an ordinary mail article sent from Australia to that overseas address.


Once the Registrar has calculated the presumed (or actual) date of service of the notice, the Registrar will work out whether the person has lodged his or her objection within 28 (90 for residents of reciprocating jurisdictions) calendar days of that date. The objection will be considered to be lodged within time if it is received by the Registrar by the 28th day after the date of service (or the 90th day for residents of reciprocating jurisdictions).


Example:If the date of service is presumed to be 1 July, the 28th day after the date of service will be 29 July.


If the 28th/90th day is a Saturday, Sunday, bank or public holiday, the last day for lodgement is the following working day.


If a person has not objected within time, they can lodge an objection with an application for an extension of time. See10.2.5for more information.


## State grounds fully & in detail


A person objecting to a decision must state the grounds they are relying upon 'fully and in detail' (CSRC Act section 84). Parents should identify the decision and explain why they believe that the decision is wrong. Where the person fails to explain the grounds for their objection, Services Australia will attempt to clarify their grounds before making an objection decision.

# 10.2.5 Extensions of time to lodge objections


## Context


If a parent or non-parent carer has not objected within 28 days (or 90 days if the parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10)(1.5.1)) of the date they received the Registrar's notice of decision (other than care percentage (1.1.C.20) decisions) an extension of time is required for the Registrar to consider the objection (1.1.O.10).


The information in this topic does not apply if the decision is a care percentage decision, see10.2.8.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 82, section 83, section 87, section 95B


## Applying for an extension of time


If a parent does not lodge an objection within 28 days (or 90 days if the parent resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction), they can apply for an extension of time to lodge their objection (CSRC Act section 82(1)). The application for an extension of time must be made in the manner specified by the Registrar (CSRC Act section 82(3)). The parent must explain why they did not lodge the objection within 28 days (or 90 days if they are a resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction) (CSRC Act section 82(2)). The extension of time application can be made with the objection or after the objection has been lodged.


## Making a decision to grant or refuse an application for an extension of time


The Registrar has 60 days (or 90 days if the parent who applied is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction) to consider the application and make a decision to grant or refuse it (CSRC Act sections 83(1) and 83(1A)).


The Registrar is deemed to have refused an application for an extension of time if the Registrar fails to make a decision within the prescribed period (CSRC Act section 83(2)). The Registrar will still make a decision on those applications unless the parent applies to theARTfor review of the deemed refusal decision. If the parent has applied for review of the decision by the ART, and the Registrar later decides to grant an application for an extension of time, the ART will treat the application for review as if it were an application for review of the new decision, unless the President of the ART refers the application to the guidance and appeals panel (CSRC Act section 95B) (10.3).


The Registrar will make a decision on an application for an extension of time taking into account that Parliament intended that parents lodge an objection within time. This gives some certainty to parents who organise their arrangements around the Registrar's decisions. In determining whether to grant an extension of time, the Registrar will consider the factors listed below:

• reasons for delay
• the merits of the objection
• any prejudice to the other parent
• whether the parent rested on their rights, and
• prejudice to the general public.

The Registrar will not grant an extension of time simply because a parent has made out any one of the above factors. All factors must be considered and given appropriate weight, with no single factor taken to be conclusive on its own.


## Reasons for delay


The Registrar will consider whether the parent has an acceptable explanation for failing to lodge the objection within the prescribed period. Factors taken into account include issues such as illness, absence from home and any efforts the parent made to lodge the objection within time or as soon as possible outside of the time frame.


Although the reason for delay is important, the Registrar is not required to grant an application for an extension of time despite the parent having an acceptable explanation for their late objection. The Registrar will consider other relevant factors before granting an extension of time.


## Merits of the objection


When considering the merits of the objection, the Registrar must decide whether, on face value, the parent has an arguable case. The Registrar will not make any judgment about information and evidence provided by the parent in support of their objection or decide whether the objection is likely to succeed.


Although the merits of an objection are an important consideration, the Registrar will not automatically grant an extension of time in all cases where the objection has merit. In some cases, the delay may be so long that the interests of justice would not be served by changing a decision on objection.


## Prejudice to the other parent


The Registrar will consider whether the delay means that it would be difficult for the other parent to provide information relevant to the objection. For example, parents may not have kept receipts for child support (1.1.C.60) payable to the other parent after a non-agency payment has been credited and the period for an objection has expired.


The Registrar will also consider whether the outcome of a successful objection would cause an overpayment or significant arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support. This takes into account the other parent's right to rely on the decision after the period for an objection has expired.


Although the potential prejudice to the other parent is an important consideration, the Registrar will not automatically refuse an extension of time in all cases where the outcome of a successful objection would create an overpayment or arrears.


## Parent resting on their rights


The Registrar will consider whether the parent rested on their rights or took action to make the Registrar aware that the decision was being contested. The Registrar will consider the length of the delay and whether any communications between the Registrar and the parent in the period after the decision was made indicate that the parent intended to challenge the decision.


## Prejudice to the general public


The Registrar will consider whether granting the request would cause prejudice to the general public. This includes considering any possible effect a proposed change would have on the other parent’s entitlement to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, such as family tax benefit.


## Procedural fairness


If the Registrar is considering granting an extension of time, the other parent will be advised. The Registrar will give them an opportunity to respond to the information that is being taken into account.


The Registrar will not contact the other parent and advise them of the application unless considering granting the application for an extension of time.


## Notice of decision


### Refusing to grant an extension of time


The Registrar must advise the parent who made the application if an extension of time is refused (CSRC Act section 83(3)). The Registrar's written notice must include reasons for the decision and advise the parent they can apply to the ART for review if they disagree with the decision (CSRC Act section 83(4)).


### Granting an extension of time


If the Registrar decides to grant an extension of time, the same notice requirements apply as for a decision refusing to grant the application (CSRC Act section 83(3) and (4)). The Registrar will also notify the other parent if an extension of time is granted. If the Registrar grants the extension of time, the 60 day (120 days where one of the parents resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction) period for the Registrar to consider the objection starts from the approved lodgement date that results from the granting of the extension (CSRC Act section 83(6), section 87(1) and section 87(1A)).

# 10.2.6 Making a decision to allow or disallow an objection


## Context


The information in this topic applies to objections (1.1.O.10) to decisions other than care percentage (1.1.C.20) decisions. See10.2.8for more information about objections to care percentage decisions.


Objection decisions must follow the requirements set out in the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation and general administrative law principles.


## Act references

## Considering an objection


An objection is a request for reconsideration of an original decision. Only authorised 'Objections Officers' will make decisions on an objection (11.1.3). An Objections Officer must not deal with an objection to a particular decision if they were involved in making that original decision.


The Objections Officer will reconsider a decision by 'standing in the shoes of the original decision maker'. They must go through the same steps as the original decision maker, come to their own conclusions about the relevant facts of the case and determine how the law is applied to those facts. They do not simply check whether there is any obvious error in the original decision on the basis of the grounds raised in the objection.


They must take into account all the relevant information available to them even if it was not available to the original decision maker. This includes all information that could have been made available to the decision maker at the time of the original decision.


If the Objections Officer is allowing or allowing in part an objection to a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision they can make a new decision (either to change the assessment, or refusing to change the assessment) taking into account all information including a change of circumstances or new reason.


The Objections Officer can also set aside the original decision to refuse to change the assessment and refer the application to a decision maker to consider the application afresh where the objection is to a:

• a decision to refuse to change an assessment because the matters are too complex (CSA Act section 98E)
• an application that has not established any grounds for a change of assessment (CSA Act section 98F), or
• subsequent application (CSA Act section 98J).

This two-step process is necessary because the Registrar must arrange for exchange of documents between the parents (1.1.P.10) and for each parent to be heard before a change of assessment decision can be made.


Example:Fynn makes a change of assessment application because of the high costs involved in spending time with, or communicating with his child. The decision maker finds that there is no reason to change the assessment because Fynn's costs do not exceed 5% of Fynn'sATI(1.1.A.20).


Fynn objects because the decision maker did not take into account all of Fynn's air fares. Fynn also provides details of significant medical costs for a new relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) who was born after the original decision was made.


The Objections Officer considers all the information that is relevant to the costs Fynn incurs in spending time with or communicating with his child and finds that the costs do exceed 5% of Fynn's ATI. In making a decision to change the assessment the Objections Officer also takes into account the information about the medical costs for Fynn's new relevant dependent child.


The Objections Officer will ensure that the process followed is procedurally fair and will give parents an opportunity to respond to information that is being taken into account.


## Decisions an Objections Officer can make


An Objections Officer must decide to allow, allow in part or disallow the objection (CSRC Act section 87(1)). They do not simply look at the grounds of the objection and decide whether they agree or disagree with the original decision. The Objections Officer must make their own findings about the facts and apply the law to those facts in order to make the correct or preferable decision (Garnaut v Child Support Registrar (2004)FCA 1100). They then compare their decision with the original decision.


If the Objections Officer finds that it was not correct to make the original decision then they will allow the objection. The original decision is set aside and the assessment and/or Register are amended as if the original decision had not been made.


If the Objections Officer finds that it was correct to make the original decision but that some aspect of the decision is incorrect, they will allow in part the objection. The original decision is taken never to have been made and the Objections Officer will make a new and preferable decision to replace the decision. The Registrar will amend the assessment and/or Register in accordance with the new decision.


If the Objections Officer finds that the original decision was entirely correct they will disallow the objection.


## Decisions involving discretion


If the original decision involved the exercise of discretion, the Objections Officer may find that the original decision was technically correct but that it was not the best exercise of the discretion. The Objections Officer must allow an objection in these circumstances and replace the decision with the preferable decision.


Example:Fatima, the payer, makes an application to change the assessment because of the costs involved in spending time with, or communicating with her child. The decision maker finds that this is a reason to change the assessment and that it is fair to reduce the annual rate by $500 per year. Fatima objects because the decision maker did not take into account significant medical costs for a relevant dependent child.


The Objections Officer considers the available information pertinent to the finding that Fatima's relevant costs exceed 5% of their ATI. The Objections Officer agrees with the decision maker's finding that this is a reason to change the assessment. The Objections Officer provides Harry, the payee, with an opportunity to comment on the new information about Fatima's medical costs for their relevant dependent child and further information from the child's treating specialist. The Objections Officer takes the new information and any information provided by the other parent into account when considering whether a change to the assessment would be just and equitable and otherwise proper.


## Statutory requirements of the objection process


In most cases, when the Registrar receives an objection the Registrar must, as soon as practicable, provide a copy of the objection, and any document that accompanied the objection, to the other parent (CSRC Act section 85(1)).


The Registrar will not send a copy of a proposed objection or supporting documents to the other party if those documents include obscene or otherwise offensive material. Such documents are not regarded as objections as they have not been made in the manner specified by the Registrar (CSRC Act section 16A) and no further action will be taken on them. The Registrar will contact the parent lodging the objection and give them an opportunity to re-submit the objection and supporting documents, without the offensive material, if they choose to.


The Registrar is not required to provide a copy of the objection to the other parent if:

• the objection is to a decision to refuse to remit penalties imposed on the payer or an employer, or
• an objection to a decision to make, or refuse to make, a change of assessment decision (5.6.1) if the Registrar is satisfied that the rights of the other parent will not be affected by any possible decision on the objection (CSRC Act section 85(2)). The Registrar may be satisfied that an objection decision will not affect the rights of the other parent where the objection raises no new issues and the original change of assessment decision is the correct or preferable decision.

Example:A parent objects to a change of assessment decision on the grounds that the decision did not take into account their moral duty to provide financial support for their mother. The original decision maker considered this matter and decided correctly that it could not be taken into account under any of the change of assessment reasons. The decision is otherwise the correct or preferable decision. The Registrar is satisfied that the rights of the other parent will not be affected by the objection decision and is therefore not required to serve a copy of the objection on the other parent.


Example:Eric and Laura have one child, Arthur. Eric has regular care of Arthur. Eric does not live close to Laura and it costs 3% of Eric's ATI travelling to see and care for Arthur. Eric applies for a change to the assessment to have his high travel costs taken into account. Because Eric's travel costs are less than 5% of his ATI they cannot be taken into account. The decision maker correctly decides that they are not able to make a change to the assessment.


Eric objects to the decision. The only grounds relied upon by Eric are the same travel costs previously stated. The Objections Officer decides that no new grounds have been raised by Eric and therefore disallows the objection. The decision is the correct decision. The Registrar is satisfied that the rights of the other parent will not be affected by the objection decision and is therefore not required to serve a copy of the objection on the other parent.


Where the other parent is served with a copy of the objection, they may lodge a notice in response to the objection within 28 days of receiving the copy of the objection and any document that accompanied the objection (CSRC Act sections 86(1) and (2)). The time for lodging a response is extended to 90 days where the parent lodging the response resides overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSRC Act section 86(2A)).


The Registrar must consider any information provided by both parents about the decision that is the subject of the objection. The Registrar will not make a decision on an objection before a notice in response is received, unless the period for returning the notice to the Registrar has ended. The exception would be where a parent advises that they do not wish to lodge a notice in response to an objection.


The Registrar will also make reasonable efforts to obtain information that is relevant to the original decision from either parent or from third parties. The officer dealing with the objection must use their judgment about the appropriate method of obtaining information in each case.


The Registrar will provide each parent with an opportunity to comment on information that may be taken into account in a way that is adverse to them.


The Registrar must make a decision within 60 days of the day on which the objection was received (CSRC Act section 87(1)). However, if the parent making the objection, or a parent served with a copy of the objection and any accompanying documents, is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the time to make a decision is extended to 120 days (CSRC Act section 87(1A)).


A parent can make an application to the Federal Court of Australia, or to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) on the basis that the Registrar has failed to make a decision on an objection within the required time (ADJR Act section 7). However, the Registrar is still obliged to make a decision on an objection even if the 60-day (or 120-day) period has ended (Garnaut v Child Support Registrar (2004) FCA 1100).


## Notifying parents of the decision


The Registrar must serve written notice of the objection decision on the parent who lodged the objection and on the other parent if the other parent was entitled to be served a copy of the objection and accompanying documents (CSRC Act section 87(2)). The notice of decision must include a statement that the parent may apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for an ART review of the decision if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the objection (CSRC Act section87(3)).


The notice must include or be accompanied by the reasons for the decision (CSRC Act section 87(3)). The reasons for decision will include:

• the Objections Officer's understanding of the relevant legislation
• the findings of facts upon which their conclusions depend, and
• the reasoning process that led them to their conclusion.

## Review of an objection decision


### The objection decision


A parent who disagrees with an objection decision (including a decision to refuse to change an assessment because the matters are too complex) can make an application to the ART for review of the decision. See10.3.


### Other decisions made by an Objections Officer


An Objections Officer can also be authorised to make decisions about other matters raised by the parents, which are not related to the objection. Any decision made by the Objections Officer, except the decision on the objection, is a new decision and either parent may object to the new decision. Another Objections Officer will make a decision on that subsequent objection.

## Context


The Registrar's original decision continues to have effect while a parent seeks reconsideration of that decision.


## Act references


CSRC ActPart VI Division 3, Part VIIIA Division 1, section 111C


## Description


The original decision continues to have effect while the Registrar considers an objection (1.1.O.10) to that decision. The Registrar or the other parent (1.1.P.10) may take action to collect amounts owing under the assessment unless a court issues a stay order in relation to that decision (10.4.2).


The Registrar may make a decision not to disburse any payments to a payee (1.1.P.30) if a payer (1.1.P.40) has objected about the validity of a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), on grounds other than parentage, and has requested a suspension of disbursement of payments to the payee. See10.2.9for further information about suspending payments to payees.

## Overview


Parents (1.1.P.10) and eligible non-parent carers may lodge with the Registrar an objection (1.1.O.10) to a care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision made under the CSA Act or having effect under the CSA Act (CSRC Act section 80A). The objection may be made orally or in writing.


If an objection to a care percentage decision is allowed and different care percentages are determined the assessment will be amended to use those percentages. The date from which the assessment will be amended will depend on when the objection was lodged (CSRC Act section 87AA).


The Secretary may make care percentage decisions under the family assistance law for the purposes of FTB which also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54K). Review of such a decision may be sought under child support law or under family assistance law. For decisions made by the Secretary, it is generally more efficient to request a review under family assistance law rather than to lodge an objection under child support law. If a care percentage decision is reviewed by the Secretary and the review varies or substitutes a new care determination for FTB, the FTB care determination will also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54L(1)).


A person dissatisfied with an objection care percentage decision may apply to the ART for review of the decision. The usual time restrictions on making an application to the ART do not apply (CSRC Act section 90(1)), but the date of effect of the ART review decision may be affected (see below).


## Making an objection


The objection to the care percentage decision may be made orally or in writing. CSRC Act section 80(6) states that the requirements of section 80, which requires that objections to a decision be made in writing, do not apply to care percentage objections.


## Time limits on lodging objections


A person may object to a care percentage decision at any time.


If the objection is made more than 28 days (or 90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10)) after notification, the date of effect will generally be the date the objection was lodged, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there were special circumstances that prevented the person from lodging the objection within 28 days (CSRC Act section 87AA).


## Grounds of the objection


A person objecting to a care percentage decision must explain 'fully and in detail' the grounds relied on (CSRC Act section 84). Where the person fails to explain the grounds for their objection, the Registrar will attempt to clarify their grounds before making an objection decision.


## Other parties to the objection


The Registrar must notify every other person who may have objected to the care percentage decision of the objection (CSRC Act section 85A).


Example:Adam and Adelaide are assessed for theCOTCJack, who is in the shared care (1.1.C.10) of Adelaide and Sally, the maternal grandmother. The Registrar makes a care percentage decision. Adelaide objects to that decision. The Registrar must notify both Adam and Sally of Adelaide's objection.


A person notified of the lodgement of a care percentage objection may, within 28 days (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction), oppose or support the objection (CSRC Act sections 86A(1) and (4)). When informing the Registrar of their support or opposition the person must give fully and in detail the grounds they rely on (CSRC Act sections 86A(2) and (3)).


## Considering the objection


In making a care percentage objection decision, the Registrar must consider any information provided by the objector and other persons about the decision that is the subject of the objection (CSRC Act section 87(1)(a)). The Registrar will not make a decision on an objection before a response is received from the persons notified of the objection, unless the period for providing a response to the Registrar has ended or a parent advises that they do not wish to lodge a response to an objection.


The Registrar will also make reasonable efforts to obtain information that is relevant to the original decision from either parent or from third parties. The Registrar's policy about obtaining information from children (11.2.2) applies. The Registrar must use their judgment about the appropriate method of obtaining information in each case.


The Registrar will provide each person with an opportunity to comment on information that may be taken into account in a way that is adverse to them.


## Making the objection decision


The Registrar must make a decision within 60 days of the objection being received (CSRC Act section 87(1)(b)). However, if the parent making the objection, or a person notified of the objection is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction, the time to make a decision is extended to 120 days (CSRC Act section 87(1A)).


In considering an objection to a care percentage decision which has already been reviewed by the Secretary, the Registrar is limited to reviewing whether the review decision made by the Secretary has been correctly applied to the child support assessment (1.1.C.70). The Registrar cannot make a different decision to the Secretary's decision on review (CSRC Act section 87(1B)).


For information on the decisions the Registrar may make, see10.2.6.


The Registrar will inform the person who lodged the objection, and the persons who were notified of the objection, of the decision in writing (CSRC Act section 87(2)). That letter will include reasons for the decision and information about further review rights (CSRC Act section 87(3)).


## Date of effect of allowed care percentage objections


If an objection to a care percentage decision is allowed and different care percentages will be determined, the assessment will be amended to use those percentages. The date from which the assessment will be amended will depend on when the objection was lodged (CSRC Act section 87AA).


If the objection was lodged within 28 days of the person being notified of the care percentage decision, then the objection decision will replace the original care percentage decision from the day it took effect.


Example:Noah and Lena are assessed for the COTC Oscar, who is in the shared care of Lena and Noah. Noah notified the Registrar on 13 August that the care of Oscar had changed on 1 August. The Registrar made a care percentage decision on 26 August that Noah has 40% care and Lena has 60% care with effect from 1 August. Lena objected to that decision on 11 September. The Registrar considered the objection and decided on 6 November to allow the objection as Noah's care percentage is 36% and Lena's care percentage is 64%. The assessment is amended from 1 August to use the objection decision percentages (Noah 36% and Lena 64%).


If the objection is lodged more than 28 days after the person was notified of the care percentage decision (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction) then the date of effect of the objection decision is the date the objection was lodged unless there are special circumstances (further information below) (CSRC Act section 87AA).


Example:Sophia and Jacob are assessed for the COTC Tamilla, who is in the shared care of Jacob and Sophia. Sophia notified the Registrar on 13 August that the care of Tamilla had changed on 1 August. The Registrar made a care percentage decision on 26 August, deciding that a change had occurred, that Sophia now has 40% care and Jacob has 60% care. Jacob objected to that decision on 11 December. The Registrar considered the objection and decided on 6 February to allow the objection, as Sophia's care percentage is 36% and Jacob's care percentage is 64%. The assessment is amended from 11 December, the day the objection was lodged, using the objection care decision percentages (Sophia 36% and Jacob 64%).


## Objection decision to apply from date of original decision


A care percentage objection decision where the objection was lodged outside of 28 days (or 90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction) may have effect from day the original decision took effect if the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances that prevented the person from lodging their objection within the required timeframe (CSRC Act section 87AA(2)). The Registrar must first be satisfied that special circumstances exist, and then the Registrar has discretion as to whether to extend the period in which to lodge the objection, in order for the objection decision to have effect from the date of the original decision.


## Special circumstances


In considering special circumstances the Registrar will look at the particular circumstances of the applicant. The applicant must show that their particular circumstances prevented them from lodging an objection within the required timeframe. They must explain why there was a delay in lodging the objection and that the circumstances are sufficiently special for the applicant to receive the benefit of an extension to the period in which to lodge an objection, in order for the objection decision to have effect from the date of the original decision. Some examples of special circumstances may include:

• the parent was seriously ill or had an accident that stopped them from lodging an objection
• the parent suffered a personal trauma such as a death in the family or a natural disaster that caused damage to the parent's property
• the parent had communication difficulties, including isolation, illiteracy or poor English-language skills
• the parent reasonably relied upon inaccurate or misleading information.

If the Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances exist, the Registrar will then consider whether it is appropriate to exercise the discretion to extend the period in which to lodge the objection (CSRC Act section 87AA(2)). The Registrar will consider if:

• the decision to extend the period in which to lodge the objection will prejudice the other parent. For example, will the extension create a significant overpayment or significant arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support?
• the applicant rested on their rights, as they did not take any action prior to lodging the objection. For example, did the applicant make any efforts to lodge the objection earlier, communicate to Services Australia that the decision was being contested or raised their concerns in other ways - for example, a complaint to Services Australia or the Ombudsman?

If the Registrar makes a determination under CSRC Act section 87AA(2) to extend the period in which to lodge the objection, then the objection is considered to have been received within the prescribed timeframe. The objection decision will then replace the original care percentage decision from the first day that original decision had effect.


Example:Harry and Mia are assessed for the COTC Kiara, who is in the shared care of Mia and Harry. Harry notified the Registrar on 13 August that the care of Kiara had changed on 1 August. The Registrar made a care percentage decision on 26 August that Harry now has 40% care and Mia has 60% care with effect from 1 August. Mia objected to that decision on 11 December, explaining that they were not able to lodge the objection earlier. The Registrar considered the objection and decided on 6 February to allow the objection, as Harry's care percentage is 36% and Mia's care percentage is 64%.


The Registrar considered if special circumstances prevented Mia from lodging the objection within 28 days. The Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances did exist. The Registrar then considered if the discretion to extend the period should be exercised. The Registrar is satisfied that Mia did not rest on their rights and that Harry would not be prejudiced by a decision to extend the period in which to lodge the objection. The Registrar makes a determination under CSRC Act section 87AA(2) that the objection was lodged within time.


The assessment is amended from 1 August to use the objection decision percentages (Harry 36% and Mia 64%) to replace the original care percentage decision.


The Registrar must provide written notice of a decision to make, or to not make a determination, under CSRC Act section 87AA(2) to the persons affected by the decision (CSRC Act section 87AA(3)). A person dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision may apply to the ART for review of that decision (CSRC Act section 89(1) item 3).


## Date of effect for child support purposes of Secretary review under family assistance legislation of care percentage decision


The Secretary may make care percentage decisions under the family assistance legislation which also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54K). If a care percentage decision is reviewed by the Secretary and the review varies or substitutes a new care determination for FTB, the FTB care determination will also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54L(1)).


If the application for FTB review was made more than 28 days after a person received notification of the care percentage decision (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction), then the review decision will apply from the date of the application for the review (CSRC Act section 110Y(2)(b)). If the Secretary initiated the review of the decision, the review decision will apply from the date of the review decision (CSRC Act section 110Y(2)(a)).


When applying the Secretary's review decision for child support purposes, the Registrar can consider ifspecial circumstancesexist so that the Secretary's review decision should have effect from the date of the original decision (CSRC Act section 110Y(3)). In making this decision the Registrar will consider the same factors as when deciding if anobjection decision should apply from the dateof the original decision. In making this decision the Registrar will consider why the application for FTB review was not made within the 28 or 90 day timeframes.


If the Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances do exist and the application for review should be considered to have been made within time, then the Registrar will determine that the Secretary's review decision will have effect for child support purposes from the date of effect of the original care percentage decision (CSRC Act section 110Y(3)).


If the Registrar considers a determination should be made under CSRC Act section 110Y(3) and decides to make a determination, or if the Registrar decides not to make a determination, the Registrar must provide written notice of the decision to the persons affected by the decision (CSRC Act section 110Y(4)). A person dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision, which determines the date of effect of the varied or substituted care percentage decision, may apply for an ART review of that decision (CSRC Act section 89(1) item 4).


## ART review of care percentage objection decisions


A person dissatisfied with an objection care percentage decision may apply to the ART for review of the objection decision. The usual time restrictions on making an application to the ART do not apply (CSRC Act section 90(1)).


If an ART review of a care determination has already been decided under the family assistance law for the purposes of FTB, the ART cannot vary the care determination if an ART review of the same care determination is sought under the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 95M).


If the person applied to the ART more than 28 days after they received the objection decision (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction) and the ART decision varies or sets aside the objection decision, substituting a new decision, then the ART decision will have effect from the date the application to the ART was made (CSRC Act section 95N(1)).


The ART can consider if special circumstances prevented the application being made within time. If it is satisfied that special circumstances do exist then the ART may decide that the application to the ART for review was lodged within time (section 95N(2)).


The ART must provide written notice of a decision to make, or not make a determination, under CSRC Act section 95N(2) to the persons affected by the decision (CSRC Act section 95N(3)). A person dissatisfied with the ART’s decision in relation to special circumstances may apply to the ART for second review of that decision (ART Act sections 131C(e), 131D(3)(e), Part 5A).


## Date of effect for child support purposes of ART review under family assistance legislation of care percentage decision


The Secretary may make care percentage decisions under the family assistance law for the purposes of FTB which also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54K). A care percentage decision may be reviewed under the family assistance law by the Secretary. A person dissatisfied with that review decision may apply to the ART for review of the care percentage decision under the family assistance law. If the ART decision varies or substitutes a new care determination for the purposes of FTB, the FTB care determination will also apply for child support purposes (CSA Act section 54L(2)).


If the application for ART review under the family assistance law was made more than 28 days after the person received notification of the Secretary's review decision (90 days for a person in a reciprocating jurisdiction), the ART review decision will apply from the date of the application for the ART first review (CSRC Act section 110Z(2)).


When applying the ART review decision for child support purposes, the Registrar can consider ifspecial circumstancesexist so that the ART review decision should have effect from thedate of the decision subject to review(CSRC Act section 110Z(3)). In making this decision the Registrar will consider the same factors as when deciding if an objection decision should apply from the date of the original decision. In making this decision the Registrar will consider why the application for ART review was not made within the 28 or 90 day timeframes.


If the Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances do exist and the application for ART review should be considered to have been made within time, the Registrar will determine that the ART review decision will have effect for child support purposes from the date of effect of the decision subject to review (CSRC Act section 110Z(3)).


The Registrar must provide written notice of a decision to make, or not make a determination under CSRC Act section 110Z(3) to the persons affected by the decision (CSRC Act section 110Z(4)). A person dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision, regarding the date of effect of the varied or substituted care percentage decision, may apply to the ART for review of that decision (CSRC Act section 89(1) item 4).


## ART second review of care percentage decision


A person dissatisfied with an ART review of a care percentage decision may apply for an ART second review of the decision (ART Act sections 131C(d), 131D(3), Part 5A)).


If an ART second review of a care determination has already been decided under the family assistance legislation, the ART cannot vary the care determination if an ART second review of the same care determination is sought under the child support legislation (ART Act section 131Q(4)).

# 10.2.9 Suspending payments to payees


## Context


In some circumstances the Registrar must suspend payments to payees (1.1.P.30) or has discretion to suspend payments to payees.


If a payer (1.1.P.40) applies to a court for a declaration that the payer should not be assessed in respect of the costs of a child because the payer is not a parent (1.1.P.10) of the child concerned, the Registrar must suspend payments to the payee while the court considers the application.


The Registrar has the discretion to suspend payments to the payee while considering the payer's objection (1.1.O.10) to the validity of a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) for reasons other than the parentage of the child concerned. The Registrar may also exercise this discretion to suspend payments to the payee while a court or theART(1.1.A.40) considers a payer's application in proceedings challenging the validity of the child support assessment for reasons other than the parentage of the child concerned.

• Suspension determination pending a payer's objection or application to the ART or a court about the validity of the assessment on other grounds (that is, not parentage)
• Resumption determinations
• Determining when payer application or objection becomes final
• Notification

## Suspension determination pending a payer's application to court about parentage


A payer can apply to a court for a declaration that they should not be assessed in respect of the costs of a child because they are not a parent of that child (a declaration under CSA Act section 107). See10.4.2for more information. A payer must serve a copy of their application for a section 107 declaration upon the Registrar (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 rule 1.13).


Unless the court grants a stay order (1.1.S.70) the payer is obliged to continue making child support (1.1.C.60) payments for the child pending the court's decision. However, when the Registrar is notified about the payer's application to court for a declaration under section 107 for a child, the Registrar is obliged to suspend payments to the payee for that child (CSRC Act section 79A).


While the suspension remains in force, the Registrar will not disburse any payments received from the payer to the payee for the child who is the subject of the payer's application. Instead, the Registrar will hold these payments in credit on the payer's account. The Registrar will continue to disburse any amounts to the payee that relate to any other child (or children) in the assessment for whom the payer is liable to pay child support.


Example:Max has a child support assessment for 2 children, Anna and Bradley, payable to Emma. Max applies to a court for a section 107 declaration in relation to child support payable for Bradley. The Registrar makes a suspension determination that results in Emma being paid a proportion of the child support received from Max, and the remainder being held in the Account. This proportion is calculated by comparing the child support that would be payable for one child with the child support payable for 2 children.


The Registrar cannot make a 'partial' suspension determination. The Registrar must hold all child support for the child subject to the section 107 application when a suspension determination is made.


The particulars of the Child Support Register (the Register) must be varied to give effect to the suspension determination (CSRC Act section 79C(1)).


## Suspension determination pending a payer's objection or application to the ART or a court about the validity of the assessment on other grounds (that is, not parentage)


The Registrar may make a suspension determination if a payer objects or applies to the ART to review the validity of the Registrar's assessment on any of the following grounds (CSRC Act section 79B(1)(a)) that:

• the child was not a child for whom an application for an administrative assessment of child support was entitled to be made
• the applicant was not a person entitled to make an application for the child, or
• the payer was not a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100).

The Registrar may also make a suspension determination if the payer has applied to a court for review of a decision made by the ART in relation to the payee's entitlement to an administrative assessment of child support for a child (section 79B(1)(b)).


The Registrar will consider making a suspension determination in a case where the payer has objected or applied to the ART or a court about the validity of the assessment on a ground other than parentage only when requested to do so by the payer. In deciding whether a suspension determination is appropriate, the Registrar will take into account:

• the merit of the payer's objection or application
• the particular circumstances of the individual case (including the interests of the payer, the payee and the child for whom child support is payable), and
• the objects of the CSRC Act (1.2.2.20).

The particulars of the Register must be varied to give effect to the suspension determination (CSRC Act section 79C(1)).


The payer can apply to court for a stay order if the Registrar has refused to make a suspension determination (see10.4.6for information about stay orders pending review of a decision made by the ART in relation to the payee's entitlement to an administrative assessment of child support for a child).


## Resumption determinations


The Registrar must resume payments to the payee for the child when a resumption determination is made.


The Registrar is obliged to make a resumption determination when:

• a court has finally refused the payer's application or it has been withdrawn, struck out or dismissed (CSRC Act sections 79A(3) and 79B(3)), or
• the Registrar or ART has finally refused the objection or application or it has been withdrawn or dismissed (CSRC Act section 79B(3)).

When the Registrar makes a resumption determination, the payee must be paid any child support retained as a result of the suspension (CSRC Act sections 79A(3)(d) or 79B(3)(d)). The particulars of the Register must be varied to give effect to the resumption determination (CSRC Act section 79C(2)).


## Determining when payer application or objection becomes final


If an application for ART review of an objection decision is not made within the time for doing so, the objection decision becomes final at the end of that period (CSRC Act section 110W(4)).


Where an ART review decision has been made and the next right of appeal is to a court, then: if an appeal to court is not made within the period for doing so, the ART review decision becomes final at the end of that period (CSRC Act section 110W(1)).


Where an ART review decision has been made, and an application could be made to the ART for second review of the decision, or to refer the decision to the guidance and appeals panel, then, if the application is not made within the time for doing so, the first review decision becomes final at the end of that period (CSRC Act section 110W(1A)).


A decision of a court is final if an appeal is not made within the time for doing so, or in the case of a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1), no application for special leave to appeal to the High Court has been made within 30 days of the decision (CSA Act section 144 in the case of an application for a declaration under CSA Act section 107 or CSRC Act section 110W(2) or (3)).


## Notification


The Registrar will provide written notice to the payer and payee when:

• a suspension determination is made, and
• a resumption determination is made.

The Registrar will include information in the notice about each parent's objection rights to that decision.


## Objection rights


A parent can object to decisions as to particulars entered in the Register, or to particulars varied in the Register (10.2). If a parent disagrees with decisions to suspend or resume, or to not suspend or resume, a parent's entitlement to be paid an amount under a registered maintenance liability, and there are decisions pending in respect of either:

• an application for a declaration that the person should not be assessed in respect to the costs of the child (1.1.C.210)(section 79A of the CSRC Act), or
• an ART or court review (section 79B of the CSRC Act)

the parent may lodge an objection either to the particulars that are varied in the Register, or to the particulars that are entered in the Register.


If the Registrar allows the objection, the particulars of the Register will be varied or restored to their original state to reflect the objection decision.

# 10.3 External review application to the ART


## Introduction


A parent (1.1.P.10) can apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of an objection (1.1.O.10) decision made by the Registrar. This chapter explains which decisions the ART can review and the process involved.


A parent can also apply to the ART for a review of certain Registrar decisions relating toDPOs (1.1.D.50). See8.3.3.30for information on the review provisions.


The ART can also undertake a second review of the following decisions:

• an ART review decision of a care percentage (1.1.C.20) objection decision (10.2.8)
• an ART special circumstances decision relating to the date of effect of an ART review decision of a care percentage decision (10.2.8)
• an ART decision to refuse an application for extension of time to apply for an ART review (10.2.5).

In certain circumstances, the President of the ART can refer an application for ART review to the ART guidance and appeals panel, or, for decisions that cannot be subject to a second review as described above, a party to an ART decision can apply to the President to refer a decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel. The guidance and appeals panel is a way of constituting the ART at a more senior level to review issues of significance to administrative decision-making, or where an ART decision may contain an error of fact or law materially affecting the decision (ARTAct Part 5).

# 10.3.1 What is the ART?


## Context


TheART(1.1.A.40) is an independent statutory body set up to review administrative decisions made by certain Commonwealth agencies. The CSRC Act and the ARTAct allow a person to seek review of objection decisions made by the Registrar.


## Act references


ARTActPart 4, Part 5, Part 5A


## Description


A person can apply to the ART for review of an objection decision. A person can also apply to the ART for review of a decision to refuse an extension of time to object, or of a decision relating to the date of effect of a care percentage (1.1.C.20) objection decision.


There is a statutory time limit for a parent (1.1.P.10) to make their application for review by the ART in most cases, other than for care percentage decisions (ARTAct section 18, CSRC Act section 90). The ART can grant an extension of time for a person to make their review application. For more information on the time limits that are relevant to applications for ART review see10.3.4.


A person can apply to the ART for second review of some ART decisions. Decisions for which second review may be sought are ART decisions on care percentage objection decisions, including a decision relating to the date of effect of a care percentage objection decision. A person can also apply to the ART for second review of a decision by the ART to refuse an extension of time to apply for ART review (CSRC Act section 92) and a decision to make or not make a determination about special circumstances in relation to a late application to the ART for review of a care percentage objection decision (CSRC Act section 95N(2)). These decisions are in the category of 'eligible social services decisions' and 'ART social services decisions', which allow a person to apply to the ART for second review (ARTAct sections 131C and 131D).


For decisions made by the ART that are not ART social services decisions, the President of the ART may, on application by a party to the decision, refer the decision to the guidance and appeals panel for review. The guidance and appeals panel is a way of constituting the ART at a more senior level (ARTAct section 105, section 123, section 131W). See10.3.2for information about decisions which can be reviewed by the ART and10.3.3for information about how to apply to the ART.


Generally, the parties to an ART proceeding are the applicant, the Registrar and the other parent affected by the decision. If a non-parent carer could have applied for a review of the decision, then they are also a party to the review. If the decision being reviewed is an objection decision regarding penalties, or an extension of time decision made by the Registrar, then generally only the applicant and the Registrar are parties to the review.


The Registrar must provide the ART with a written statement of reasons for the decision and copies of all relevant documents within 28 days after the ART notifies the Registrar of the application for review (ARTAct section 23).


The ART reviews the merits of the Registrar's decision and will take a fresh look at the decision under review. The ART can affirm, vary or set aside the Registrar's decision and make a new decision in substitution or remit the matter to the Registrar with any orders or recommendations. At any time during a proceeding, the ART may remit the decision under review to the Registrar for reconsideration. See10.3.5for more information on the review process.


The ART’s decision will have effect from the same date as the original decision unless specified otherwise by the ART (ARTAct section 108). This does not apply to an ART decision on ART review of an objection to a care percentage decision, where the ART decision is not a second review decision and the application for ART review was made to the ART more than 28 days (or if the applicant is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10), 90 days) after notice of the objection decision was given (CSRC Act section 95N(1)).


A party dissatisfied with an ART review decision (including a decision of the ART constituted as the guidance and appeals panel) may appeal to a court on a question of law (see10.4.6on appeals and court orders under the CSRC Act).

# 10.3.2 Decisions which can be reviewed by the ART


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of most objection (1.1.O.10) decisions, and also decisions to refuse an application for an extension of time to lodge an objection (10.2.5). A party who is dissatisfied with an ART care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision, the date of effect of an ART review decision regarding a care percentage decision or an ART decision to refuse an application for extension of time to apply for an ART review decision may apply to the ART for second review of the decision (ARTAct section 131C, section 131D).


Applications to the ART can also be made for review of certain decisions made by the Registrar, which cannot be objected to, in relation toDPOs (1.1.D.50) andDACs (1.1.D.30)(CSRC Act section 72T). See8.3.3.30.


In some circumstances, the ART may be constituted as the guidance and appeals panel. The circumstances where this may occur are, broadly, where there is an issue of significance to administrative decision-making and/or an ART decision may contain a material error of fact or law.


## Act reference


ARTActPart 4, Part 5, Part 5A


## Objection decisions


A parent can apply to the ART for review of an objection decision made by the Registrar (CSRC Act section 89).


See10.2.2for information about decisions made under the CSA Act to which a parent may object.10.2.3has information about decisions made under the CSRC Act to which a parent may object.


The parent who objected to the Registrar's original decision, or the other parent or non-parent carer who was advised of the objection, may apply to the ART for review of the objection decision.


## Extension of time decisions


A parent can apply to the ART for review of a decision made by the Registrar to refuse to grant an application for an extension of time to lodge an objection (item 1 of the table in CSRC Act section 89(1)).


## ART second review


A person may apply to the ART for second review of decisions known as 'ART social services decisions' which are decisions that the ART has made upon review of certain objection decisions, or where the ART has made certain original decisions. Those decisions are known as 'eligible social services decisions' and are the following:

• a care percentage objection decision, including a decision that special circumstances did not apply in relation to a late objection (10.2.8)
• a decision by the ART to refuse an application for extension of time to lodge an application for ART review (CSRC Act section 92)
• a decision by the ART to make or not make a determination under CSRC Act section 95N(2) in relation to special circumstances for late applications to the ART for review of a care percentage objection decision.

## Guidance & appeals panel


A person may apply to the President of the ART to refer certain ART decisions to the guidance and appeals panel. If the President refers a decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel, the review of the panel relates to the decision affirmed, varied or set aside by the ART decision (ARTAct section 123).


A person cannot make an application for referral of a decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel in relation to an eligible social services decision (ARTAct section 131W(a)).


A person cannot make an application for referral of a decision of the ART to the guidance an appeals panel in relation to an ART second review decision (ARTAct section 131W(b)).

# 10.3.6 Effect of ART first or second review application on the original decision


## Context


The Registrar's objection (1.1.O.10) decision has effect after a parent (1.1.P.10) applies forART(1.1.A.40) review of that decision. Similarly, the decision made by the Registrar or by the ART on review has effect after a parent applies for ART second review of that decision. This is subject to stay provisions in the CSRC Act and the ARTAct.


## Act reference


CSRC Actsection 95A, section 95B, section 110R, section 111C


ARTActsection 31, section 32, section 131M, section 131V


## Stay orders & suspensions


When a parent applies for ART review of an objection decision made by the Registrar, the reviewable decision will continue to have effect until the ART makes a decision (CSRC Act section 110R), unless a stay order is made. A parent can apply to a court for a stay order under CSRC Act section 111C to stay the Registrar's reviewable decision until the outcome of the ART review is known, unless it is a proceeding referred to the guidance and appeals panel. When a parent has applied to have their ART decision referred to the guidance and appeals panel, the parent may apply under the ARTAct for an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation of the reviewable decision (ARTAct section 32(2), CSRC Act section 95A).


In relation to an application for ART second review of a care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision, that decision has effect until the ART second review is decided (ARTAct section 32(1)). On the request of a party to the ART review, the ART may stay the decision under review until the outcome of the ART second review is known (ARTAct section 32(2), section 131V). The parties to the ART review have the opportunity to be heard in relation to the request for a stay order (ARTAct section 32(7)).


The Registrar may make a decision not to disburse any payments to a payee (1.1.P.30) if a payer (1.1.P.40) has applied to the ART challenging the validity of the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), for reasons other than the parentage of the child concerned, and has requested a suspension of disbursement of payments to the payee. See10.2.9for further information about suspending payments to payees.


## Variations to decisions


The Registrar may vary or substitute a decision after an application has been made for an ART review of the decision. In this situation the Registrar must give written notice to the ART of the variation or substitution and the ART will treat the application for review as though it relates to the varied or substituted decision.


The Registrar is not able to vary or substitute a decision where the President of the ART refers an application for review to the guidance and appeals panel. The Registrar is also not able to vary or substitute a decision where an application is for referral of an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel and the ART has been constituted as the guidance and appeals for the purposes of the proceeding (CSRC Act section 95B).


The Registrar is also not able to vary or substitute a decision where an application is for ART second review (ARTAct section 131M).

# 10.3.3 How to apply to the ART for a review of a child support objection decision


## Context


A person who disagrees with an objection (1.1.O.10) decision made by the Registrar can apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of that decision.


## Act references

ARTActPart 4, Part 5A


ART (Child Support) Practice Direction 2024


ART (Common Procedures) Practice Direction 2024


## Application requirements


A person can apply to the ART for review of an objection decision, for review of a decision regarding the date of effect of a care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision (10.2.8), and for review of a decision made by the Registrar to refuse an application for an extension of time to lodge an objection (10.2.5).


A person can also apply to the ART for second review of care percentage decisions, including decisions regarding the date of effect of a care percentage decision. Second review may also be sought of decisions by the ART on the date of effect of an ART care percentage decision and of decisions by the ART to refuse an extension of time to apply for ART review (‘eligible social services decisions’ and ‘ART social services decisions’) (ARTAct Part 5A).


An application for ART review of a decision may be made in writing, including completing and submitting an electronic application, a paper form or by letter (ARTAct section 34, ART (Common Procedures) Practice Direction 2024 Part 3).


Part 3 of the ART (Common Procedures) Practice Direction 2024 specifies an application for review must include the applicant’s details, information about the decision sought to be reviewed and the reasons why the decision should be reviewed.


Further information about how to make an application for review and the information that must be included in an application can be found at theART website.


## Implementation of decisions that are under review


An objection decision continues to apply while an application for review is under consideration by the ART. A party to the ART review may apply to a court for a stay order (1.1.S.70) in relation to the objection decision, pending the outcome of the ART review (CSRC Act section 111C). The ART cannot exercise its power in relation to staying the operation or implementation of a child support (1.1.C.60) decision unless the review relates to an ART second review or a guidance and appeals panel application (CSRC Act section 95A, ARTAct section 32, section 131V).


The Registrar may vary or substitute a decision after an application has been made for an ART review of the decision. In this situation, the Registrar must give written notice to the ART of the variation or substitution and the ART will treat the application for review as though it relates to the varied or substituted decision. However, where the ART review is a second review process, or where the ART is constituted as the guidance and appeals panel following a referral by the President of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel, or because of a guidance and appeals panel application, the Registrar may not vary or substitute the decision unless an exception applies (CSRC Act section 95B and ARTAct section 31 and section 131M).

# 10.3.4 Time limit on applications for ART review


## Context


The information in this topic does not apply toART(1.1.A.40) review of care percentage (1.1.C.20) objection decisions. If a parent (1.1.P.10) applies for a review of a care percentage objection decision that is not an application for second review, the usual time restrictions on making an application to the ART do not apply, but the date of effect of the ART review decision may be affected. For information on ART review of care percentage objection decisions, refer to10.2.8.


A parent must apply for ART review within 28 days of the date they received notice of the reviewable decision (ART Rules 2024), or within 90 days for parents who reside overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSRC Act section 90(2)). If a parent did not apply in the specified time, they can make an application for review that includes a written application for an extension of time to apply.


## Act references


ARTActsection 18(1), section 19, section 131C, section 131D, section 131J


CSRC Actsection 90, section 91, section 92, section 93


## Applying for an extension of time for an ART review


If a parent does not make an application for an ART review within 28 days of the notice of the reviewable decision being provided (or 90 days for parents who reside overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction), they can apply to the ART for an extension of time to lodge their application for a review (CSRC Act section 91). The ART is not required to notify other parties in relation to an application for an extension of time for review unless the ART or a court decides the extension application is to be granted (CSRC Act section 93(1), ARTAct section 21).


## Making a decision to grant or refuse an application for an extension of time


The ART has 60 days (or 90 days for parents who reside overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1)) to consider the extension of time application and make a decision to grant or refuse it (CSRC Act section 92(1), section 92(1A).


Where an extension of time is granted, the applicant is taken to have validly made the application for ART review (CSRC Act section 92(6)).


## ART review of ART decision to refuse an application for an extension of time


A decision of the ART to refuse an extension of time application is an eligible social services decision (ARTAct section 131C(c)). This means if a person's extension of time application is refused by the ART then that person can apply to the ART for review of the decision to refuse the extension application (ARTAct section 131D(3)(e)).


Applications for review must be lodged with the ART within 28 days from the date the applicant received the ART decision to refuse the extension application (ARTAct section 18, section 131J).


The ART can grant an extension of time for a person to make an application for review of the extension refusal decision (ARTAct section 19). Before determining an application for an extension of time to review the extension refusal decision, the ART may give notice to, or require the applicant to give notice to, any party the ART considers may be affected by the application (ARTAct section 19(5)).


Where an affected party gives notice to the ART that they wish to oppose the application for an extension of time to review the extension refusal decision, the ART will not grant the application for extension unless the applicant and affected party are given a reasonable opportunity to present their case (ARTAct section 19(6) and (7)).

# 10.4.1 Overview of court applications, appeals & orders


## Context


In some circumstances a parent (1.1.P.10) may apply directly to a court if dissatisfied with some Registrar decisions made under the CSA Act and the CSRC Act. In other cases a parent may be able to appeal to court following a decision of theART(1.1.A.40).


On a direct application, the court may make a range of orders affecting a child support case (1.1.C.80). Where an application was based on an appeal from the ART on a question of law, the court may make orders about how the ART should reconsider the decision.


## Act references


Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977(ADJR Act)


## Court applications & orders


In some circumstances, a parent can apply directly to a court if they are dissatisfied with a decision made by the Registrar under the CSA Act or the CSRC Act. It is usually necessary for the Registrar to have dealt with an objection (1.1.O.10) about the decision before the parent can make their court application.


A court dealing with a parent's application under the CSA Act or CSRC Act must have jurisdiction to deal with child support (1.1.C.60) matters under those Acts. Courts with jurisdiction include:

• Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia
• State and Territory Courts of summary jurisdiction
• Family Court of Western Australia
• Supreme Court of the Northern Territory.

The court may make other orders affecting a child support case that are detailed in10.4.2and10.4.6, including orders about child support agreements, stay orders (1.1.S.70) and orders against a payee (1.1.P.30) for the repayment of overpaid child support.


The court may also make some orders under the FL Act that may affect a child support assessment (1.1.C.70). These include orders relating to care (1.1.C.10) of a child.


The ADJR Act provides that a parent may apply to the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) for a review of any decision made by the Registrar, except for change of assessment decisions under Part 6A of the CSA Act. Applications under the ADJR Act relate to whether the Registrar has properly made the decision according to law. The court cannot review the merits of the decision (10.4.7).


In certain circumstances a parent can also apply directly to a court for a change to their child support assessment because of special circumstances (CSA Act section 116).


## Court appeals of ART decisions


The ARTAct and the CSRC Act set out the courts which a person may appeal to from a decision of the ART. These are the Federal Court of Australia and (in certain circumstances) the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2).


A party to a proceeding in the ART may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law from the decision of the ART (ARTAct section 172).


A party to a proceeding in the ART may choose to appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) on a question of law from the decision of the ART. This type of appeal is not available if the ART is constituted by at least one member who is a Judge or Deputy President of the ART (CSRC Act section 99, ARTAct section 172(1)). An appeal to the Federal Court of Australia is still available in those circumstances.


At the request of a party to the proceeding or on its own initiative, the ART may, with the agreement of the President, refer a question of law arising in a proceeding to the Federal Court of Australia for decision. Where this occurs, the ART must not make a decision in that proceeding to which the question of law is relevant while the court’s decision is pending. Following the court’s decision, the ART cannot proceed or make a decision that is inconsistent with the court’s opinion on the question (ARTAct section 185).


A decision of the President of the ART to refer or not refer a decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals following an application from a party to the decision is not a decision of the ART and cannot be appealed to court on a question of law (ARTAct sections 123, 128 and 172(2)).

# 10.3.5 The ART review process


## Context


TheART(1.1.A.40) replaced theAATfrom 14 October 2024. Any matters before the AAT at the commencement of the ART automatically transitioned to the ART.


The ART’s objective (ARTAct section 9) is to provide administrative review that:

• is fair and just
• resolves applications in a timely manner, with as little formality and expense as possible
• is accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of parties
• improves the transparency and quality of government decision-making, and
• promotes public trust and confidence in the ART.

The ART is independent of the Child Support Registrar.


The ART (Common Procedures) Practice Direction 2024 outlines the practice and procedures that generally apply to ART applications and review proceedings.


The ART (Child Support) Practice Direction 2024 outlines the practice and procedures specifically relating to applications for review of child support (1.1.C.60) decisions and the conduct of proceedings that apply to the review of child support decisions.

## Application received by the ART


When the ART receives an application for review of an objection (1.1.O.10) decision made by the Registrar, the ART will send a letter acknowledging receipt to the applicant. The ART will also notify the Registrar and other parties (when relevant) that the application has been received (ARTAct section 21).


## Family violence


If there is a current family violence order against a party, that party will be required to participate in the hearing by video, telephone or other electronic means (and not in person) unless the ART decides that the party protected by the family violence order is to participate by video, telephone or other electronic means.


If a party has obtained a family violence order against another party to the review, the party who obtained the order must give the ART a copy of any current family violence order within 14 days after making, or being notified by the ART of, the application for review. The person protected by the family violence order must also advise the ART if their personal details such as their residential address, contact details or place of employment are not known to the other party.


## Parties to a review


Where an application is made to the ART for review of a decision, the ART must give written notice of the application to the applicant, the Registrar and any other party to the proceeding. Where the ART considers that the interests of another person who is not a party to the proceeding may be affected by the decision, the ART may also give, or require the applicant to give, to that person written notice of the application and the person’s right to apply to become a party to the proceedings (ARTAct section 21).


The parties to ART proceedings are generally the applicant, the Registrar and any other person entitled to apply for a review of the decision under CSRC Act section 89 (for example, the other parent (1.1.P.10) or a non-parent carer) (ARTAct section 21, section 22, CSRC Act section 95D). For most objection decisions and ART review decisions this will mean that all of the parties to the child support case (1.1.C.80) are parties to the ART review of the decision.


If the decision being reviewed is an objection decision regarding penalties, or an extension of time decision made by the Registrar then generally only the applicant and the Registrar will be parties to the review.


The Registrar is taken to be a non-participating party in ART review proceedings. The Registrar will not appear before the ART, give written submissions or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless ordered to do so by the ART or otherwise allowed by the ART to participate (ARTAct Part 4, Division 5, Subdivision B). However, this does not apply for ART second review proceedings, where the Registrar will ordinarily be a fully participating party. As a non-participating party the Registrar can still be required to meet certain obligations to the ART and the other parties, such as the provision of documents.


A person can apply to the ART to become a party to the proceeding. The ART must be satisfied that the person’s interests are affected by the decision under review and that it would be appropriate for that person to be made a party to the proceeding (ARTAct section 22(1)(c)).


A child of a party who is aged under 18 years cannot give oral evidence in an ART proceeding (CSRC Act section 98A). This includes a child under the age of 18 who is the child of the applicant or respondent parent, or a child who is cared for by a non-parent carer who is a party to the review. Additionally, a child will not be permitted to attend an ART proceeding and if a hearing is proceeding by electronic means, parties are required to immediately inform the ART if a child is or becomes present.


Except where the ART is constituted by the guidance and appeals panel, the hearing of the child support review proceedings must be in private. The normal rules about generally hearing ART matters in public do not apply. The ART may give directions about the persons who may be present at a review proceeding. In giving directions, the ART must have regard to the wishes of the parties and the need to protect their privacy. (CSRC Act section 95K, ARTAct section 69).


A person who has made an application for ART review may withdraw the application at any time. A withdrawn application is taken to have been dismissed by the ART (ARTAct section 95).


The ART may dismiss an application if the applicant does not appear at the proceeding or an event in relation to the application for review and the ART is satisfied that the applicant received appropriate notice of the relevant event (ARTAct section 99).


If a party other than the applicant or a non-participating party to an ART proceeding does not appear at the proceeding or an event in relation to the application for review and the ART is satisfied that the party received appropriate notice of the relevant event the ART may direct that the party ceases to be a party to the proceeding (ARTAct section 83).


## Documents to be provided by the Registrar

• Documents to be sent within 28 days
• Documents to be provided by the Registrar for application to ART for extension of time
• Some documents may not be required to be sent
• ART may give directions restricting secondary disclosure of documents
• Additional information can be sought

### Documents to be sent within 28 days


When the Registrar is advised that an application for review has been received by the ART, the Registrar is required to provide the ART with reasons for the decision under review within 28 days or an earlier time if the ART requests (ARTAct section 23, section 28 and CSRC Act section 95C).


The Registrar is also required to provide a copy of every document that is relevant to the review of the decision and is in the possession or under the control of the Registrar. All documents referred to or relied upon in the objection decision must be included. Documents required to be sent will include all letters relevant to the decision, a copy of the Registrar's records of conversations with the parents and a copy of any materials relied upon in making the objection decision. As documents 'relevant to the review of the decision' are to be provided, some documents received after the objection decision was made may be included if they will assist the ART in undertaking their review of the objection decision.


Example:Mustafa is dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision on an objection to the care percentages (1.1.C.20) used in calculating the assessment of child support. Both parents have provided the Registrar with calendars and other materials about the children's living arrangements, either when the decision was first made or during the objection process.


If Mustafa was to apply to the ART for an ART review of the objection decision, the information received from the parents would be provided to the ART as relevant documents.


Example:Cleo is dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision on an objection to the care percentages used in calculating the assessment of child support. Cleo has also made an application for a change to the assessment.


If Cleo was to apply to the ART for a review of the objection decision, the information received from the parents regarding care would be provided to the ART as relevant documents. The documents relating to the change of assessment (1.1.C.50) application would not be included unless they are relevant to the objection decision.


Example:Andy, a payer, is dissatisfied with the Registrar's decision on an objection to the calculation of the arrears (1.1.A.100) owing when the liability again became collectable by the Registrar. The objection decision is dated 8 January 2024.


On 18 January 2024 the Registrar received a letter from Andy that included receipts for payments made in the relevant private collect (1.1.P.110) period. As the objection decision had been made there are no further review processes within the department.


If Andy was to apply to the ART for a review of the objection decision, the letter received 18 January 2024 would be provided to the ART as a relevant document.


The Registrar is also required to provide a copy of the statement of reasons and relevant documents to each other party to the proceeding within the same time period (ARTAct section 27).


In preparing the documents, the Registrar will remove some identifying details from the documents for privacy or other reasons. Details the Registrar will redact include, but are not limited to, a person’s tax file number, residential and postal address, email address, telephone number and any Centrelink or child support identification number, as well as any other redactions permitted under the published practice directions of the ART. The Registrar is not allowed to redact other information contained in a relevant document without seeking and obtaining the permission of the ART.


### Documents to be provided by the Registrar for application to ART for extension of time


When the Registrar is advised that an application for an extension of time to apply to the ART for review of a decision has been received by the ART, the Registrar will provide to the ART within 28 days:

• a statement described in ARTAct section 23, and
• a copy of any correspondence and any record of oral communication between the applicant for the extension of time and the Registrar after the Registrar served notice on that person of the decision about which review is sought.

### Some documents may not be required to be sent


The Registrar may identify that a relevant document contains information about a person that is private and considers that it would not be appropriate for that information to be sent to the other party. The information may be a medical report or information relating to a third person, such as a family member of one of the parties.


The Registrar can apply to the ART for an order directing that the document, or part of the document, is not required to be sent. The Registrar must provide one copy of the document to the ART with the application for the order (ARTAct section 70, section 29(3)). The Registrar is not required to send a copy of the application to each party to the ART review (CSRC Act section 95L).


The ART will consider the application and may either direct the Registrar to send the document to the party concerned or make an order prohibiting or restricting the disclosure to the other parties to an ART review of the contents of the document (ARTAct section 70).


### ART may give directions restricting secondary disclosure of documents


The ART may make an order prohibiting or restricting the disclosure, to some or all of the parties to an ART review, of the contents of a document. The order may be made after an application by the Registrar or on the initiative of the ART.


The ART may also direct a person who was authorised under the primary order to receive a document, not to disclose the information specified in the primary order. It is an offence to contravene such an order, and the penalty is imprisonment for 12 months or 60 penalty units or both (ARTAct section 70, CSRC Act section 98C).


### Additional information can be sought


The ART may require further information from the Registrar or another person in order to make a decision. The ART may direct that the further information be provided by requiring production of a document or that a person attend a hearing to answer questions. (ARTAct section 26, section 74, CSRC Act section 95H).


The ART may also require the Registrar to exercise information gathering powers the Registrar holds under the CSA Act or the CSRC Act to obtain information for the ART that is relevant to an ART review (CSRC Act 95J(1)). The Registrar must comply with such a request from the ART as soon as practicable and no later than 7 days after the request is made (CSRC Act section 95J(2)).


## Variation of original decision after application for review lodged


The Registrar may vary or substitute a decision after an application has been made for an ART review of a decision. In this situation the Registrar must give written notice to the ART of the variation or substitution and the ART will treat the application for ART review as though it relates to the varied or substituted decision. The person who applied for ART review would need to notify the ART if they do not want to seek review of the varied or substituted decision (CSRC Act section 95B). However, if the President of the ART has referred an application for ART review of a decision of the Registrar to the guidance and appeals panel, the Registrar cannot vary the decision after the referral has been made (CSRC Act section 95B(1AA).


If the President of the ART has accepted a person’s application to refer a decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel and the Registrar varies the decision after the application was made and before the ART is constituted as the guidance and appeals panel, then the guidance and appeals panel proceeding is in relation to the decision as varied by the Registrar (CSRC Act 95B(1B).


Note:For decisions that can be subject to ART second review, the Registrar may not vary or substitute a decision outside the ART second review process (ARTAct section 131M). See10.2.8.


## Application may be dismissed


An application for a review of a decision of the Registrar can be dismissed by the ART.


The reasons the ART can dismiss an application include:

• the decision is not a reviewable decision (ARTAct section 97)
• the application is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance, has no reasonable prospects of success, or is otherwise an abuse of process (ARTAct section 101)
• the applicant does not appear at a Tribunal case event or fails to comply with an order of the ART (ARTAct section 99, section 100)
• all parties, other than any non-participating parties, consent to the dismissal (ARTAct section 96).

If an applicant withdraws their application, the ART is taken to have dismissed the application (ARTAct section 95(2)).


## Application may be reinstated


### Request for reinstatement


Where an application was dismissed by the ART, the applicant whose application was dismissed may, within 28 days of receiving notification of the dismissal, or such longer period as the Tribunal, in special circumstances, allows, request that the application be reinstated (ARTAct section 102).


The ART may also reinstate an application for review on its own initiative if the ART considers the application was dismissed in error (ARTAct section 102(2)).


## Submissions from the parties


### Submissions from parties other than the Registrar


The ART must ensure that all parties to the review, other than any non-participating party, are given a reasonable opportunity to present their case, access information or documents relevant to the ART decision and make submissions (ARTAct section 55).


The ART may make directions about the conduct of the proceedings.


### Submissions from the Registrar when the Registrar is a non-participating party


When involved in an ART review as a non-participating party, the Registrar may make written submissions to the ART (ARTAct section 63). The Registrar may also give written notice to the ART that they wish to participate in the proceeding (ARTAct section 62). The ART may also order the Registrar to make written submissions or otherwise participate in the proceeding (ARTAct section 63(2)).


## Directions hearing


The ART may hold a directions hearing to discuss the conduct of an ART review (ARTAct section 80, ART (Common Procedures) Practice Direction 2024).


## The hearing


The ART will generally be constituted by a single member. Where the ART is constituted by 2 or 3 members, a presiding member will be appointed for the purposes of the proceeding (ARTAct section 37, section 39). In reviewing a decision the ART is not bound by rules of evidence (ARTAct section 52). The ART is required to conduct proceedings with as little formality and technicality, and with as much expedition as a proper consideration of the matter permits (ARTAct section 50). An ART review for child support purposes, other than in relation to a guidance and appeals panel proceeding, must be held in private (CSRC Act section 95K).


The ART may take evidence on oath or affirmation for the purposes of a review of a decision (ARTAct section 76). Children of the parties, or children being cared for by a non-parent carer who is a party, are not to give oral testimony (CSRC Act section 98A). The ART may adjourn the hearing from time to time. The ART may give directions about the procedure to be followed on the hearing of the review and/or direct who will be present during the hearing.


## Decisions that can be made


The ART is independent of the Child Support Registrar and will take a fresh look at the decision under review. The ART will make a fresh decision after considering the relevant information provided by all parties (including information provided at the hearing) and the applicable child support law. The ART must determine what the correct or preferable decision is in the circumstances of each case.


After reviewing the merits of an objection decision, the ART must make a decision to (ARTAct section 105):

• affirm that decision
• vary that decision
• set aside that decision and substitute a new decision, or
• set aside that decision and send the matter back to the Registrar with directions or recommendations. This may result in the Registrar making a new objection decision to replace the original objection decision. If a parent is dissatisfied with the new objection decision, they can apply to the ART for review of the decision.

The parties to the review (which includes the Registrar) may reach agreement on the review decision that should be made (ARTAct section 103). If such an agreement is reached, the ART may then make the decision as agreed without holding a hearing if it is satisfied that it is within its power to make that decision.


The ART can exercise the relevant powers and discretions of the Registrar when reviewing a decision of the Registrar (ARTAct section 54). Despite this the ART must not, for the purposes of an ART review, exercise a power or discretion conferred on the Registrar that is prescribed in the CSRC Regs (CSRC Act section 95E, CSRC Regs section 25, Schedule 3).The Registrar must immediately take action to give effect to the ART decision (CSRC Act section 110V).


## Notification of decision


The ART is required to give each party to the proceeding written notice of the ART decision, reasons for the ART decision, notice of the right to apply to the guidance and appeals panel (where applicable), notice of the right to apply for ART second review (where applicable) and notice of the right to appeal to court on a question of law from the decision (ARTAct section 111).


## Publication of review proceedings


CSRC Act section 110X imposes restrictions upon the publication of an account of review proceedings if the report identifies a party to the proceedings or other people relevant to the review. The restrictions do not apply for certain purposes (CSRC Act section 110X(4)).


## Appeal to a court on a question of law


Refer to10.4.6for information on appealing ART decisions to court on a question of law.


## Application for ART second review


The ARTAct provides for ART second review of eligible social services decisions (ARTAct section 131C, section 131D). The following are eligible social services decisions for child support purposes:

• a care percentage decision (within the meaning of the CSRC Act)
• a decision by the ART to refuse an application for extension of time to seek ART review (CSRC Act section 92)
• a decision to make, or not make, a determination about special circumstances in relation to a late application for ART review of a care percentage decision (CSRC Act section 95N). This section does not apply in relation to the date of effect of an ART second review of a care percentage decision.

## Guidance & appeals panel


The guidance and appeals panel is a way of constituting the ART at a more senior level. Applications for ART review can be referred to the ART by the President of the ART. Parties to a decision of the ART can apply to the President of the ART to refer that decision to the guidance and appeals panel (ARTAct section 121).


Upon receipt of an application for ART review, the President may refer the application to the guidance and appeals panel if satisfied that the application raises an issue of significance to administrative decision-making and it is appropriate in the interests of justice to make the referral (ARTAct section 122).


A person can also make an application to the President of the ART to refer certain decisions of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel. The President may make such a referral if satisfied that the ART decision raises an issue of significance to administrative decision-making or that the ART decision may contain a material error of fact or law materially affecting the ART’s decision. The President is not required to refer any decision of the ART to the guidance and appeals panel (ARTAct section 128). An application for referral of an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel must be made with 28 days after the ART has given the statement of reasons for the decision (or such longer period as the President, in special circumstances, allows) (ARTAct section 125).


An application for referral of an ART decision to the guidance and appeals panel cannot be made in relation to a decision of the ART that is an eligible social services decision (ARTAct section 131W).


More information on the ART review process is available at theART website.

## Court applications that can be made under the CSA Act


The CSA Act allows parents to apply directly to a court for a range of orders.


The parties to court proceedings under the CSA Act are the parents and any non-parent carer (where relevant). However, the Registrar must be served with a copy of any application or appeal (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 rule 1.13(4)(c)). The Registrar may intervene in any court proceedings under the CSA Act (section 145). If the Registrar intervenes in court proceedings, the Registrar is taken to be a party and has all the rights, duties and obligations of a party to the proceedings.


Parents and non-parent carers can make the following court applications under the CSA Act:

• if an application for an assessment has been refused because the Registrar could not be satisfied about the parentage of the child, an application can be made for a declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child (1.1.C.210) because that person is a parent of the child (section 106A)
• if the Registrar has accepted an application for an assessment, an application can be made for a declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because that person is not a parent of the child (section 107). An application cannot be made under section 107 if the Court has previously made a declaration under section 106A (section 107(1A)). Instead, an appeal may be made against the section 106A declaration.
• an application for leave for the Registrar or a court to make a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision in relation to an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) for a period that is more than eighteen months earlier (sections 111 and 112)
• an application for a change to a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) because of special circumstances (section 116), wherethe parents have other family law matters in the court, or
• the parents have other family law matters in the court, or
• an application for an order for child support to be provided in a form other than periodic amounts (1.1.P.80) or a lump sum (section 123)
• an application to have a court set aside a child support agreement or a termination agreement (section 136)
• an application for an urgent maintenance order (section 139)
• an order that a payee (1.1.P.30) refund an amount of money paid as child support (1.1.C.60) where no liability to pay child support existed (section 143).

The fact that such proceedings are before a court (or the Registrar in some instances) does not prevent the child support assessment being made and enforced, unless a court makes a stay order (1.1.S.70) staying the operation of the assessment.


A court can make a stay order under the CSRC Act section 111C which stays or otherwise affects the operation or implementation of the CSA Act or the CSRC Act. An application to a court for a stay order under the CSRC Act can be made if:

• a proceeding has been instituted in a court having jurisdiction under the CSRC Actthis does NOT include an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) from an ART decision under the ARTAct (see10.4.6for a stay order under the ARTAct)
• this does NOT include an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) from an ART decision under the ARTAct (see10.4.6for a stay order under the ARTAct)
• an objection is proceeding before the Registrar under Part VII of the CSRC Act
• a review is proceeding before the ART, other than in relation to a guidance and appeals panel application or in relation to an ART second review
• a departure determination is proceeding under Part 6A of the CSA Act
• court review of certain decisions is proceeding under Part 7 of the CSA Act.

## Declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child (section 106A)


If the Registrar refuses to accept an application for a child support assessment, and one of the reasons was that the Registrar could not be satisfied that a person named is a parent of the child, then an application to court can be made for a declaration that the person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because the person is a parent of the child.


Most applications under section 106A are made to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2). The application must be made within 56 days of receiving the notice of refusal to accept an administrative assessment of child support for the child (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 rule 1.13(3)).


If a person is outside that timeframe, they may ask the court for an extension of time to file the application. If an extension of time is not sought or granted, a person can reapply to the Registrar for an application for administrative assessment. If there is no information to allow the Registrar to be satisfied about parentage, a new notice of refusal will issue, enabling a court application under 106A to be made within the 56-day time frame.


The parties to the court application are each person who was to be assessed in respect of the costs of the children. Where the application is made by a non-parent carer, the non-parent carer is also a party. Although not a party to the court application, the Registrar has the power to intervene in the proceedings (section 145).


Alternatively, the applicant can make a new application for assessment. If the applicant is able to provide new information that would satisfy one of the presumptions of parentage in relation to the person to be assessed in respect of the costs of a child, the Registrar can accept the application. If a new application is made, any resulting assessment will only take effect from the date of the new application. If the new application is refused, the person can seek a court declaration under section 106A.


### Effect of a section 106A declaration


If the court makes a declaration under section 106A and the only reason for refusal of the application was the lack of proof of parentage, the Registrar is taken to have accepted the application for an administrative assessment with effect from the date that the Registrar originally received the application. If there were other reasons for refusal of the application, the Registrar has to reconsider the application in light of the court's declaration.


A court may make a section 106A declaration in a case where the Registrar has refused more than one child support application in relation to the same parties. The Registrar will attempt to establish which child support application was cited in the court application, including by examining the court application, if this is not apparent from the declaration. The Registrar's administrative assessment will start from the date that the Registrar received the child support application cited in the court application. If it is not possible to identify which refused application for assessment provided the basis for the court application, in the absence of information to show that the court extended the time to apply for the declaration, the Registrar will generally assume that the most recent application was considered by the court and the assessment will start from the date of that application.


### Declaration of parentage or section 106A declaration


The Registrar will not reconsider an application for assessment on the basis of a declaration that is not clearly made under section 106A. The court order must state that it is made under section 106A and/or that the person named in the order should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child. It is not sufficient for the court to simply declare that a person is the parent of the child, as it may do, for example, under FL Act section 69VA.


However, an order, such as a parentage declaration under FL Act section 69VA, can be used to satisfy parentage requirements for a fresh application for assessment (CSA Act section 29(2)(c)). This will result in a child support assessment being made from the date of the fresh application only. See2.1.3on parentage and10.4.4on FL Act orders affecting a child support assessment.


## Declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of costs of the child because the person is not a parent of the child (section 107)


If the Registrar accepts an application for an administrative assessment for child support, an application to court can be made for a declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of a child because the person is not the parent of the child. The parties to the court application are the person who was assessed in respect of the costs of the child and the person who applied for the administrative assessment. Although not a party to the court application, the Registrar has the power to intervene in the proceedings (section 145).


An application for a declaration under section 107 cannot be made if a court has already declared under section 106A (see above) that the person concerned should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child. Instead, the applicant may appeal the section 106A declaration (section 107(1A)). If a payer (1.1.P.40) is successful in having a section 106A declaration overturned on appeal, and where a court has made a recovery order (1.1.R.30) requiring the former payee to repay an amount to the former payer, the Registrar can register the order and recover these amounts (8.4.7).


A parentage declaration under FL Act section 69VA does not have the effect of a declaration made under CSA Act section 107 and therefore the Registrar will not end the administrative assessment. See10.4.4for more information on section 69VA orders.


### Payments of child support pending the application


Where child support is collectable by the Registrar, child support will continue to be collected from a payer who makes an application to a court for a declaration under section 107, but the payment of child support to the payee for that particular child will be suspended until the court deals with the application (CSRC Act section 79A) (10.2.9).


A payer can also apply to the court for a stay order under CSRC Act section 111C for an order that affects the liability or the payment of the liability pending the outcome of the section 107 declaration.


### Effect of a section 107 declaration on the child support assessment


If a court makes a declaration under section 107, the Registrar is taken never to have accepted the application for child support for that child. The Registrar will end the administrative assessment for that particular child from the start date of the assessment.


Where the section 107 declaration does not relate to all of the children in the child support case, the Registrar will reassess the child support for the remaining children on the basis that the assessment has always related to those children only (section 107A). The Registrar will only reassess the assessment for the 'affected days', that is, the days where there is at least one child who is subject to a section 107 declaration and at least one child who is not.


### Effect of a section 107 declaration on child support payments


The Registrar will refund to the payer any payments that were held pending the outcome of the section 107 application (10.2.9). However, the Registrar will not repay any amounts already paid to the payee.


Where the assessment ends from the start date because the section 107 declaration applies to all the children of the case, the amounts disbursed to the payee constitute an overpayment to the payee.


Where the child support is reassessed because the section 107 declaration does not apply to all the children of the case, the amounts previously disbursed to the payee under the original assessment are applied to the amounts payable under the amended assessment (section 107A). If the total of the amounts disbursed exceed the total of the amended amounts payable, the excess amount constitutes an overpayment to the payee (section 107A(4)).


If child support is reassessed but there is a period of time where the child affected by the section 107 declaration was the only child of the assessment, any amounts disbursed to the payee under the assessment for that period are not applied to the amended amounts payable (section 107A(3)). Amounts are considered paid under particular assessment periods on the basis that payments are made towards the oldest outstanding debt first.


Overpayments created as a result of section 107 declarations are not debts to the Commonwealth and are not recoverable by the Registrar. However, the overpayment can be recovered by the payer obtaining a recovery order. These orders can be registered with the Registrar for collection. The court must consider making such an order as soon as practicable after making a declaration under CSA Act section 107.


Example:All assessment periods affected by section 107 declaration


Margaret and Fred have a child support assessment with monthly Registrar collection for 2 children, Cory and Cindy, beginning 1 January 2021. Fred is liable to pay Margaret $300 per month for both children. Fred pays the monthly liability on time every month.


On 1 July 2021, Fred obtains a section 107 declaration in relation to Cory. Cory is removed from the assessment from 1 January 2021.


The affected days are the days from 1 January to 30 June 2021. Child support is reassessed for this period and Fred is liable to pay $200 per month to Margaret for Cindy, a total of $1,200 for the period.


Fred has paid $1,800 for both children for the period 1 January to 30 June 2021, $600 more than the reassessed liability for Cindy. The overpayment of $600 can be recovered by the payer obtaining a court order under CSA Act section 143.


Example:Some assessment periods unaffected by section 107 declaration


Alfie and Frank have a child support assessment with monthly Registrar collection for child Jodi, beginning 1 July 2020. Alfie is liable to pay Frank $100 per month. Another child, Charlie, is added to the assessment from 1 July 2021. Alfie is now assessed to pay $200 per month to Frank for the 2 children Jodi and Charlie.


Alfie pays no child support until September 2021 and then makes a lump sum payment of $1,400. This meets the arrears (1.1.A.100) outstanding from the assessment from 1 July 2021 to 31 July 2021 (applying the payment to the oldest outstanding debt). Alfie still owes child support for August and September 2021.


On 1 October 2021, Alfie obtains a section 107 declaration in relation to Charlie. Charlie is removed from the child support assessment.


The days in the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 are not considered affected days because Jodi is not affected by the declaration and Charlie was not included in the assessment until 1 July 2021.


The affected days are the days from 1 July to 30 September 2021, when both Jodi and Charlie were included in the assessment. Child support is reassessed for this period and Alfie is liable to pay $100 per month to Frank for Jodi, a total of $300 for the period. Alfie has paid $200 under the assessment for the affected days (the first $1,200 of the lump sum was applied to the liability for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021, with $200 applied to the original liability for July 2021), and this is applied to the remaining liability for the affected days (that is, $300). As at 1 October 2021, Alfie has arrears of $100, relating to Jodi.


Example:Child affected by section 107 declaration was the only child of the assessment for a period


Mel and Arwa have a child support assessment with monthly Registrar collection for child Sadiq, beginning 1 July 2019. Mel is liable to pay Arwa $250 per month. On 1 November 2019, child Ric is added to the assessment and the assessment is increased to $350 per month.


Mel pays no child support until 1 January 2020 and then makes regular monthly payments of $350.


On 1 July 2020, Mel obtains a section 107 declaration in relation to Sadiq.


The days in the period 1 July to 31 October 2019 are not considered affected days because Sadiq is the only child in the assessment. Any child support payments attributed to this period can only be recovered by the payer obtaining a court order under CSA Act section 143.


The affected days are the days from 1 November 2019 to 31 June 2020, when both Sadiq and Ric were included in the assessment. Child support is reassessed for this period and Mel is liable to pay $250 per month for Ric, a total of $2,000. Mel has previously paid a total of $2,100 ($350 per month for the period 1 January to 30 June 2020). Of this amount, $1,000 has been attributed to arrears for the period 1 July to 31 October 2019 ($250 for 4 months), when Sadiq was the only child in the assessment (applying the principle that payments are attributed to the earliest arrears first).


The remaining amount of $1,100 that has been paid is applied to the period from 1 November 2019 and is attributed to the amended assessment that relates to Ric. As at 1 July 2020, Mel has arrears of $900.


If a recovery order is registered for collection and the payee under that order is a payer who owes child support (arrears or ongoing) to the other parent, the Registrar may offset the debts by reducing the higher debt by the amount of the lesser debt (CSRC Act section 71AA).


Example:Using the above scenario:


If Mel obtained and registered a section 143 order for Arwa to repay her $1,000, that amount would be offset against the $900 arrears that Mel owes to Arwa for Ric. The result would be that Arwa owes $100 to Mel.


See8.1.6for more information about offsetting debts.


## Application for leave to make a change of assessment decision in relation to an administrative assessment for a period that is more than 18 months earlier (sections 111 & 112)


A court may grant leave under section 112 for:

• the Registrar to make a retrospective change of assessment decision under CSA Act section 98S, or
• a court to make a retrospective departure decision under CSA Act section 118

which would change the assessment of child support payable for a day that is more than eighteen months before the date upon which an application for leave was made to the court under section 111. The court cannot grant leave to change an assessment for a day that is more than 7 years before the date of the application under section 111 (section 112(7)(a)).


### Application by parent or non-parent carer for leave


A parent and any non-parent carer can apply to the court for leave for the Registrar to make a change of assessment determination under CSA Act section 98S or for the court to make a departure order under CSA Act section 118 in relation to an administrative assessment for a period that is more than eighteen months earlier (section 111(1)). There must be a child support assessment in force at the time of applying for a change of assessment for the Registrar to make a change of assessment determination under CSA Act section 98S. However, a court can make a departure order under CSA Act section 118 in relation to a case that has ended. See5.6.1for more information on the change of assessment process.


The court must take into account the matters listed in CSA Act section 112(4) and may have regard to any other relevant matter when deciding whether to grant leave (section 112(5)).


If the court grants leave, it will make an order specifying the period for which the court or the Registrar may change the assessment (section 112(6)). However, the order does not imply that the Registrar or the court is required to make a change for the specified period (section 112(8)).


If the court considers that it would be in the interests of the parties for the court to deal with the application for a change of assessment, rather than have a parent apply to the Registrar for a change of assessment, the applicant is taken to have made anapplication to the court under section 116(section 112(2)).


The parties to the application are the parents and any non-parent carer (section 111(2)), although the Registrar can choose to intervene in the proceedings (section 145).


### Application by the Registrar for leave


The Registrar can apply to the court for leave to make a change of assessment decision (5.6.2) in relation to an administrative assessment for a period that is more than eighteen months earlier (section 111(3)).


The Registrar will only apply to the court in exceptional circumstances. The Registrar must also consider the public interest and those matters listed in section 112(4) before initiating court processes.


If the Registrar applies to the court for leave, the parties to the application are the parents, any non-parent carer and the Registrar (section 111(4)).


When dealing with an application from the Registrar for leave, the court must take into account the same matters that it considers when it deals with an application from a parent or non-parent carer. The types of orders the court can make are the same, regardless of who makes the application for leave.


## Application for a change to a child support assessment in special circumstances (section 116)


In some circumstances, a parent or non-parent carer can apply to a court for a change to their child support assessment if one or more of a specified range of special circumstances apply to them, their children or the other parent. These special circumstances are the same as the reasons for an application to the Registrar for a change of assessment (Part 5).


### When can a parent or non-parent carer apply to court for a change of assessment?


In most cases, a parent or non-parent carer must first apply to the Registrar for a change of assessment (Part 5). A parent may only apply directly to a court for a change to their child support assessment in the following circumstances (section 116):

• they are the liable parent and are assessed at the minimum rate of child support under CSA Act section 66(1)
• the liable parent or the carer entitled to child support have another matter pending in a court with jurisdiction under the CSA Act and the court is satisfied that it would be in the interests of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support for the court to consider whether a departure order should be made.

The court will decide whether there is a ground to depart from the administrative assessment and, if so, whether it is fair and proper to do so.


### Parties to the court application


The parties to the application are the parents and any non-parent carer in the case (section 116(3)). Although not a party to the court application, the Registrar has the power to intervene in the proceedings (section 145).


### Payments of child support pending the application


The Registrar's assessment of child support continues to apply while the court deals with a parent's application and the Registrar will continue to collect child support payable under the assessment. However, a parent can apply to the court for a stay order under CSRC Act section 111C for orders that affect the liability or the payment of the liability pending the outcome of the application.


## Application for child support to be paid in a form other than periodic amounts or a lump sum (section 123)


A parent or non-parent carer may apply to a court for child support to be paid otherwise than by periodic payments or as a lump sum payment to be credited against the relevant child support liability. A common example is where a parent entitled to receive child support applies for an order requiring the other parent to make payments of school fees or to make a one-off payment of child support at the time of property settlement in substitution for (section 124), or to be credited against (section 123A), the periodic liability.


An application under section 123 may only be made if an administrative assessment is in force in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support and the liable parent, on the day the application is made (section 123(2)(a)).


### An order for child support to be paid in a form other than periodic amounts (section 124)


When a court makes an order for child support to be in a form other than periodic amounts, it must also specify whether the payment is to reduce the relevant child support assessment (section 125).


The order may state that:

• payments under the order will reduce the relevant child support assessment by a certain percentage or a specific amount, or
• payments under the order will not affect the relevant child support assessment.

If the court does not specify how the order will affect the child support liability, it will not affect the assessment of child support.


### Orders for child support to be paid in the form of a lump sum payment (section 123A)


A court may make an order for a parent to provide child support in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against the relevant child support assessment if:

• the amount of the lump sum payment equals or exceeds the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment (section 123A (1)(c)).

If the court makes such an order, the lump sum payment is credited, under CSRC Act section 69A, against the amount payable under the child support liability (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment). The order must specify the percentage of the relevant liability that is to be met in this way (subsection 123A(3)).


The remaining lump sum amount is indexed each year in line with inflation (CSRC Act section 69A). See7.5.3for information about crediting lump sum payments.


## An application to have a court set aside an agreement (section 136)


A person who is a party to a child support agreement or a termination agreement can apply to a court to have the relevant agreement set aside. The court may set aside an agreement if:

• the agreement of one of the parties was obtained by fraud, undue influence or unconscionable conduct
• another party to the agreement or someone acting for another party exerted undue influence or duress in obtaining agreement or engaged in unconscionable or other conduct to such an extent that it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement
• the agreement is a limited child support agreement (6.1) and there has been a significant change in the circumstances of one of the parties or the relevant child so that it would be unjust not to set aside the agreement
• the agreement is a limited child support agreement and provides for an annual rate of child support that is not proper or adequate
• the agreement is a binding agreement (6.1) and there are exceptional circumstances which have arisen since the agreement was made that means a party to the agreement or the relevant child will suffer hardship if the agreement is not set aside. (There have been several decisions which have discussed the meaning of 'exceptional circumstances' with most citingSimpson and Hamlin(1984) FLC 91-576. In the decision ofDaley & Daley(2009) FMCAfam 398, the Federal Magistrate stated that the circumstances 'must be considered within the overall legislative structure created by the CSA Act.' The court has also said that separate factors can have a cumulative effect and amount to 'exceptional circumstances' (Gallup & Gallup(2009) FMCAfam 839)), or
• the agreement is a transitional agreement (6.1), and the court is satisfied that the agreement was made before 1 July 2008, was made without at least one of the parties to the agreement receiving independent legal advice from a legal practitioner before entering the agreement, and that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement is not set aside.

### Parties to the court application


The parties to the application are the parties to the child support agreement. Although not a party to the court application, the Registrar has the power to intervene in the proceedings (section 145).


### Powers of the court if the agreement is set aside

• If the court sets aside a child support agreement, the agreement is terminated on the day on which the court order takes effect (CSA Act section 80D and section 80G).
• If the agreement resulted in a child support assessment under section 34B (because child support was already payable), the court may make a departure order pursuant to CSA Act Part 7 Division 4 without the need for a separate application to be made, provided that the court is satisfied that a ground for departure as set out in section 117(1)(b) exists, and that it is just and equitable to make a departure order (section 136(4)), or
• no ground for departure exists, but the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make the order having regard to benefits that the payee has received pursuant to the agreement (section 136(5)).
• If the agreement initiated a child support assessment under section 93 (because child support was not already payable) child support will cease to be payable for a child covered by the agreement (CSA Act section 93(1)(h)). As a result, the court would not be able to exercise the discretion in subsection 136(4) to make an order under CSA Act Part 7 Division 4.

If a court sets aside the agreement it can make consequential orders to preserve or adjust the rights of the child or the parents (section 137).


## Urgent maintenance orders (section 139)


If an application for the administrative assessment of child support has been made to the Registrar and a court is of the opinion that the child is in urgent need of financial assistance, the court may order the payment of a periodic or other amount even if the Registrar has refused to accept the application.


An urgent maintenance order has effect for the period specified in the order. However, if a child support application is later accepted or refused the urgent maintenance order ceases to have effect once:

• child support becomes payable for the child under an administrative assessment (the liability under the urgent maintenance order will end from the start date of liability of the assessment)
• the Registrar's decision to refuse an application for assessment becomes final because the period within which an application could be made to a court under section 106A, or to the ART, or the period within which an appeal could be made to a court, has ended and an application has not been made to a court or to the ART for an ART review (section 139(2B)), or
• the decision of a court or the ART that the person was not entitled to an administrative assessment becomes final.

## An order for recovery of an amount where no liability to pay child support existed (section 143)


CSA Act section 143 gives a court the discretion to make an order for recovery of amounts paid under a child support assessment or registered maintenance liability. The court may make such orders as it considers just and equitable to give effect to, or to adjust, the rights of the payer and payee concerned.


For further details, see8.1.1and8.4.7.


## Other powers of the court (section 143B)


A court may dismiss a proceeding under the CSA Act if it is satisfied that the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious (section 143B).

# 10.4.4 FL Act orders affecting a child support assessment


## Context


Orders under the FL Act may affect a child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


## Act references


FL Actsection 66M, section 69VA


CSA Actsection 5, section 106A


## On this page


The following is an explanation of how the Registrar will interpret FL Act orders that affect the assessment of child support (1.1.C.60):

• orders in relation to step-children
• declaration that a person is a parent of a child
• orders about where a child will live & with whom the child will spend time

## Orders in relation to step-children


A child support parent's (1.1.P.10) step-child can be considered to be their relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) if the child support parent has at least shared care (1.1.S.40) of the step-child and there is an order in force under FL Act section 66M (orFamily Court Act 1997section 124 in Western Australia) in relation to the child support parent and the step-child. The inclusion of a relevant dependent child means that a parent has an amount recognising their support of the child deducted from theirATI(1.1.A.20) before calculating child support.


To obtain an order under section 66M a person must be a step-parent to the child, that is, they must:

• not be a parent of the child
• be or have been married to, or be or have been a de facto partner of, a parent of the child, and
• treat, or at any time during the marriage or de facto relationship have treated, the child as a member of the family formed with the parent (FL Act section 4).

In making an order under section 66M the court has to take into account:

• the objects and the principles of the FL Act
• the length and circumstances of the marriage to, or relationship with, the relevant parent of the child
• the relationship between the step-parent and the child
• the arrangements for maintenance of the child, and
• any special circumstances which would result in injustice or hardship to any person.

If a child support parent is providing financial support for a step-child and neither of the child's biological parents is able to provide financial support for the child due to death, ill health or caring responsibilities, the parent may have grounds for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) under the CSA Act. See5.2.11for more information.


## Declaration that a person is a parent of a child


If parentage is in issue in proceedings under the FL Act, a court can require evidence and make a conclusive declaration about parentage (FL Act section 69VA). A declaration under section 69VA will satisfy the Registrar that a person is a parent of a child if an application is made for a child support assessment.


If the Registrar has refused to accept an application for an assessment because no proof of parentage was available and the court later makes a declaration under FL Act section 69VA, the parent can make a new application for child support using the declaration under section 69VA as proof of parentage. A declaration under FL Act section 69VA does not mean that the Registrar is taken to have accepted the original application for child support.


If the parent has obtained an order under CSA Act section 106A, the Registrar may be taken to have accepted the original application for child support. See10.4.2for more information on declarations under CSA Act section 106A.


## Orders about where a child will live & with whom the child will spend time


This topic is covered in4.1.1and4.2, which describes how and when these orders are used to determine a percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for a parent or non-parent carer.

# 10.4.3 Implementing court orders made under the child support legislation


## Context


When notified of an order that affects an assessment, the Registrar must take any action necessary to amend the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) to give effect to the order. This section explains how the Registrar gives effect to specific kinds of court orders.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 66, section 108, section 113, section 116, section 118, section 119, section 127, section 138, section 142


CSRC ActPart VII, Part VIIIB


## On this page


This section explains how the Registrar gives effect to specific kinds of court orders, including:

• implementation of court orders
• when court orders become final
• orders for a periodic amount
• orders reducing the assessment to nil
• an order to reduce arrears under the CSA Act
• orders varying, setting aside or nullifying an earlier order
• orders the Registrar cannot implement
• severability of clauses in an order.

The section also discusses:

• end dates of orders to change the assessment
• effect of an agreement on an order to change the assessment
• terminating events and departure orders
• orders setting a rate of child support for more than one child
• unemployment clauses
• self-supporting children
• children in full-time education
• orders and notations
• recitals.

## Implementation of court orders


When a court's decision under the child support legislation becomes final, the Registrar must take action that is necessary to amend the child support assessment to give effect to the order. However, the Registrar may, and generally will, give effect to a court order as soon as possible after being notified of the provisions of the court order, without waiting for the order to become final. If the order is changed following an appeal, the Registrar will amend the child support assessment again to reflect the terms of the later order.


Note:An order made by consent of the parties is an order of a court, and not a child support agreement.


## When court orders become final


An order of a single Judge or Magistrate becomes final at the end of the period allowed by the court rules for an appeal to a higher court. This is usually 28 days. An order of the full bench of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) will become final 30 days after it is made unless an application is made to the High Court for special leave to appeal.


## Orders for a periodic amount


An order may say that a parent (1.1.P.10) must pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80). The Registrar will generally interpret such orders as orders to change the assessment unless there is an indication to the contrary. If there is a heading on the order that suggests it is made under the provisions of the FL Act the case officer should obtain a copy of the application to check whether the applicant applied for a departure order.


The Registrar will generally accept that the court has acted correctly in making the order, unless there is a further court order that has set aside the order or a finding by a court that the order was made without power.


## Orders reducing the assessment to nil


The Registrar cannot make a change of assessment decision that has the effect of reducing the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) below theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support if the liable parent has less than regular care (1.1.R.50) of the children (CSA Act section 98SA). However, a court may make such orders and the Registrar will give effect to them (CSA Act sections 118, 119 and 66(8)(a)).


## An order to reduce arrears under the CSA Act


A departure order may purport to discharge arrears (1.1.A.100) where an assessment has been made under the CSA Act. The child support legislation does not expressly provide for arrears to be discharged, but the Registrar will give effect to these orders where possible by varying the rate of child support for a specified period. To avoid any uncertainty a departure order that seeks to discharge arrears should set the rate of child support for the period equal to the amount which has already been paid for that period. This will have the effect of removing the accrued child support arrears.


## Orders varying, setting aside or nullifying an earlier order


The CSA Act does not provide for a parent to apply to have a previous court order varied or set aside. However, the same effect can be obtained by applying to a court for a departure from the assessment. If a court makes such an order, the Registrar will interpret it to be an order to change the child support assessment and will make appropriate amendments to the assessment.


If a court makes an order that nullifies an earlier order, this means that the earlier order should not have been made and has no legal effect. The Registrar will amend the assessment as if the earlier order had not been made.


## Orders the Registrar cannot implement


If the Registrar cannot give effect to an order, the parents, and if appropriate, their legal representatives, must be advised. They must also be advised that they have the right to object (10.2) under Part VII of the CSRC Act if they consider that the particulars of their assessment are incorrect because the Registrar did not give effect to the order.


## Severability of clauses in an order


A child support agreement or court order that contains clauses that can be accepted or registered under the child support legislation, may also contain clauses that cannot be accepted or registered under the legislation. The clauses that could usually be accepted or registered, cannot be if doing so without accepting or registering the other clauses would change their meaning or change the essential nature of the agreement or order. Such clauses are said to be 'not severable' from the other clauses and the application for acceptance or registration of the entire agreement or order must be refused.


The Registrar will advise both parents if there are clauses that cannot be accepted or registered and discuss alternative options.


## End dates of orders to change the assessment


An order changing the assessment has effect until:

• a terminating event (2.6.3) occurs (CSA Act section 142)
• a further departure order is made, or
• the end date or occurrence of an event specified in the order has occurred.

## Effect of an agreement on an order to change the assessment


When the Registrar accepts a child support agreement that includes provisions:

• for one party to pay periodic child support to another
• varying the rate at which periodic child support is already payable, or
• agreeing any other matter that can be included in an order made by the Court under CSA Act Division 4 of Part 7

the agreement has the same effect as a new court order and can replace or otherwise affect an existing court order (CSA Act section 95(2)).


## Terminating events & departure orders


A terminating event (2.6.3) may happen in relation to all or some of the children covered by the assessment subject to a court order that changes the assessment. The order ceases to be in force as of the date of the terminating event (CSA Act section 142, CSRC Act section 111H). The order will remain in force for any child not affected by the terminating event.


If a parent reapplies for an administrative assessment after a terminating event (for example, because a child who had left their care (1.1.C.10) later returns to their care), the Registrar will use the formula and not the departure order when a new assessment is made for the child for whom the assessment ended.


Where a departure order is in force that covers only some of the children of the relationship, or where the order has ceased to be in force for some of the children, the Registrar will make a 'mixed assessment'. Some of the children will be assessed in accordance with the departure order and others in accordance with the child support formula, as appropriate.


## Orders setting a rate of child support for more than one child


A court order or agreement that sets a rate of child support for more than one child should ideally state how much is payable for each of the children. In the absence of such a statement, the Registrar cannot apportion the amount between the children. When the court order or agreement ends in relation to one or more of the children and the order does not specify an amount for each child, the Register will continue to reflect the full amount payable under that order or agreement.


Example:An order states that $100 per week each for the 2 children of the marriage is payable making a total of $200 per week. The eldest child reaches 18 years of age and the liability is reduced to $100 per week.


Example:An order states that $200 per week is payable for the children of the marriage. There are 2 children and when the eldest reaches 18 years, $200 will remain payable as it is not clear how the total amount was to be apportioned between them.


## Unemployment clauses


Court orders and child support agreements can suspend or reduce the liability when a parent is unemployed. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will take the following issues into account when interpreting the court order.


For the liability to be varied when a parent becomes unemployed, the Registrar must be able to determine the person's employment status. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Registrar will accept that a parent is unemployed if they receive an income tested benefit or pension. Where the parent does not receive a benefit or pension, the Registrar will consider statements made by the parent and documentary evidence such as an employment separation certificate.


Many court orders and agreements allow for a reduced liability during periods when a parent is 'in receipt of unemployment benefits'. A difficulty arises when a parent is not employed but is not receiving an unemployment benefit, or is receiving another type of benefit. A broad interpretation will be given to the term 'unemployment benefits'. The Registrar may apply such a clause where the person is receiving an income tested benefit or pension as a result of not being in employment (for example, disability support pension). However, a parent is still employed if they are receiving benefits but their employment hasn't been terminated.


A parent may be unable to work because of a work related injury, and receive periodic compensation payments. The Registrar will determine if the parent is still employed by their employer. If the employment contract has been terminated, the Registrar will accept that the person is 'unemployed' despite being in receipt of payments that may be greater than those payable to unemployed welfare beneficiaries.


A court can make an order that varies a parent's liability in a current period of unemployment, or one that applies during any period of unemployment.


Example:An order states that the amount payable is to be reduced to $10 per week until Kylie gains full-time employment. This applies to Kylie's current period of unemployment.


Example:An order states that the amount payable is to be reduced to $10 per week during periods when Kylie is not in full-time employment. This applies whenever Kylie is not in full-time employment after the date of the order.


## Self-supporting children


Court orders and child support agreements sometimes contain a provision providing for a reduction in child support payable if the child is self-supporting. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will interpret the clause in the following way.


The Registrar must be satisfied that the child is self-supporting. The Registrar will not consider whether or not the child is capable of being self-supporting or should be self-supporting.


In determining whether a child is self-supporting, the Registrar will determine the child's actual income and whether the child is paying for their basic living expenses without financial support from another person. Basic living expenses include accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs. The Registrar will disregard any entitlement the child (or another person) has to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit (CSA Act section 3(2)(c)(ii)). If the child is also making lifestyle choices that would not be available without an independent source of income (for example, buying a car), the child is more likely to be self-supporting.


If the child is living away from home, the Registrar will consider whether the payee (1.1.P.30) continues to have care and control of the child or whether the child is living independently from the payee and meeting their own costs. The Registrar will consider whether there has been a terminating event.


If the child continues to live with the payee, they will be self-supporting if they pay a reasonable contribution towards household expenses including accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs, or if they pay board equal to this amount to the payee. If the child is living with the payee but is not contributing towards those household expenses, or is only making a nominal contribution, the Registrar will find that the child is not self-supporting.


The Registrar will not attempt to obtain this information from a child under the age of 18 years and will request evidence from the parents in order to make a decision.


## Children in full-time education


Court orders and child support agreements sometimes state that they are to operate until a child ceases to be in full-time education or until they finish a particular level of education such as secondary schooling (1.1.S.10). Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will consider the following issues when interpreting the clause.


Some institutions such as TAFE offer a range of courses from secondary education to vocational training and higher education courses. Tertiary education involves a distinct qualification, a certificate, diploma or degree, rather than matriculation or vocational training. The Registrar will ask for evidence from the payee about the child's student status. If the child is still at secondary school, the Registrar will find that the child is in full-time education.


If the child has finished secondary school and is studying at an institution that considers the child as a full-time student, the Registrar will generally accept that the child is in full-time education. See9.3.4.60for more information.


## Orders & notations


A court order made by consent under Part 7 of the CSA Act for a departure from an assessment can sometimes contain notations, notes or annotations to draw attention to actions the parents have taken or will take in the future. While a notation can indicate the parents' intentions, they are not orders and cannot be registered or vary an assessment.


Such notations, however, may refer to the payment of expenses and support a proposition that a parent has agreed that they are separately or jointly responsible for certain payments. Therefore, they may form part of the evidence the Registrar considers in determining the parents' intentions for purposes such as non-agency payments or change of assessment matters.


## Recitals


A court order may contain information in the form of recitals. Recitals are generally statements setting out the facts and providing background that are considered by a court when making the order. Recitals often include a statement indicating the intention of the parents. However, recitals are usually not a legally binding part of the order. Recitals are often helpful when interpreting the order if there is any ambiguity in the clauses and words used in the order.

# 10.4.5 Effect of a court order for maintenance of an eligible child where there is no assessment


## Context


The FL Act states that a court cannot make an order for the maintenance of a child if a parent (1.1.P.10) can apply for an assessment of child support (1.1.C.60) for that child.


## Act reference


FL Actsection 63G, section 66E, section 86, section 87


## Court order for maintenance of a child


Section 66E states that a court cannot make an order for the maintenance of a child if an application could properly be made under the CSA Act in relation to the child and their parents.


Occasionally a court makes an order under the FL Act that should not have been made because one or both of the parents was eligible to apply for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30). However, the Registrar will not question whether such an order is validly made and will register it, subject only to checking that the order has not expired, or has not ceased to be in force.


If the Registrar is notified of a court order that appears to contravene section 66E, the Registrar will advise both parents that they may apply for an assessment. If the Registrar accepts an application for assessment the court order will cease to have effect from the start date of liability of the assessment (CSA Act section 152). If the order was made by consent and a copy has been signed by both parents the order may also meet the requirements for a child support agreement (Part 6).


Where the Registrar becomes aware that an order that contravenes section 66E has been registered, the order will not be deregistered. The Registrar will advise both parents that the liability will continue to be payable under the order, unless either parent applies for an administrative assessment or unless one of the parents challenges the order in court and the order is set aside.


If an order has been made and the parties already have an active child support assessment (1.1.C.70), the Registrar will generally assume that the order is intended as a variation to the existing assessment, and will implement the order accordingly.


## Maintenance provisions in a parenting plan or child maintenance agreement


A provision for periodic child maintenance in a parenting plan or child maintenance agreement made under the provisions of the FL Act has no effect and is not enforceable in any way (FL Act sections 63G(5), 86(3B) and 87(4D)) if an application for an assessment could have been made under the CSA Act. The Registrar will not register such an agreement or provision as a court order. However, if a copy of the parenting plan or child maintenance agreement is signed by both parents then the provisions relating to child support may meet the requirements for a child support agreement (Part 6).

# 10.4.6 Appealing ART decisions in court


## Context


A party to anART(1.1.A.40) proceeding may appeal the decision of the ART to a court on a question of law.


A party can also apply to a court for a stay order (1.1.S.70) under the ARTAct. The stay order can stay or affect the operation or implementation of the ART decision or the decision by the Registrar that was reviewed by the ART.


## Act references

Federal Court Rules 2011


## Appealing ART decisions


The ARTAct and the CSRC Act set out the courts that a person may appeal to from a decision of the ART. These are the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2).


A party to a proceeding in the ART may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on a question of law from the decision of the ART (ARTAct section 172).


A party to a proceeding in the ART may choose to appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) on a question of law from the decision of the ART. An appeal to this court is not available if the ART is constituted by at least one member who is a Judge or a Deputy President of the ART (CSRC Act section 99, ARTAct section 172(1)).


## Time limits for appeals


An appeal must be brought within 28 days of receiving notice of the ART decision or within such further time as allowed by the court (ARTAct section 174, Federal Court Rules 2011 and Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021).


## Parties to court proceedings


The parties to a court appeal from a decision of the ART are the people who were the parties to the relevant ART proceeding (CSRC Act section 98D). For guidance on who can be a party to an ART proceeding, see10.3.5.


## Powers of the court


When deciding an appeal, a court can make orders it thinks appropriate (ARTAct section 176), including orders:

• setting aside the decision of the ART
• affirming the decision of the ART, or
• directing the case back to the ART for rehearing, with or without the hearing of further evidence in accordance with the directions of the Court.

A court may dismiss a proceeding relating to an ART decision if it is satisfied that the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious (Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 section 20A, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Act 2021 section 239.


## Implementation of a decision


When an objection (1.1.O.10) decision is made, or the ART or the court make a decision, the Registrar must immediately take such action as is necessary to give effect to that decision (CSRC Act section 110V).


## Effect of applying to a court from an ART decision


An ART decision continues to have effect from the time it is made and is not affected because a person appeals that decision. The Registrar or the other parent may take action to collect amounts, subject to the effect of a stay order issued by a court under the ARTAct.


The Registrar may make a decision not to make disbursements (1.1.D.60) to a payee (1.1.P.30) if a payer (1.1.P.40) has applied to a court challenging the validity of the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), for reasons other than the parentage of the child concerned, and has requested a suspension of disbursement of payments to the payee. See10.2.9for further information about suspending payments to payees.


## Stay order under the ARTAct


If an appeal (on a question of law) is instituted in the Federal Court of Australia from an ART decision, the court may make an order staying or otherwise affecting the operation or implementation of the ART decision or the decision by the Registrar that was reviewed by the ART. The stay order is made under section 178(2) of the ARTAct.


For an appeal initiated in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) certain provisions of the ARTAct apply as if the appeal was made to the Federal Court. This includes the power of the court to make a stay order (CSRC Act section 99(3)(c)).


## Stay order under the CSRC Act


A court can make a stay order under section 111C of the CSRC Act which stays or otherwise affects the operation or implementation of the CSA Act or the CSRC Act. An application to a court for a stay order under the CSRC Act can be made if:

• a proceeding has been instituted in a court having jurisdiction under the CSRC Actthis does not include an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) from an ART decision under the ARTAct (see stay order under the ARTAct, above)
• this does not include an appeal to the Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) from an ART decision under the ARTAct (see stay order under the ARTAct, above)
• an objection is proceeding before the Registrar under Part VII of the CSRC Act
• a review is proceeding before the ART, other than a proceeding in relation to a guidance and appeals panel application, or in relation to a second review
• a departure determination is proceeding under Part 6A of the CSA Act, or
• court review of certain decisions is proceeding under Part 7 of the CSA Act.

A court may make a stay order if it is desirable to do so, taking into account the interests of the persons who may be affected by the outcome of the proceedings.


A stay order has effect for the period specified in the order or, if no period is specified, until the proceeding (decision) of the court, the Registrar or ART, becomes final.


A child support (1.1.C.60) proceeding to which section 111C applies is the process from the time the relevant application is received until the proceeding is finalised.


An objection decision is final if an application for ART review has not been made within the prescribed period. The prescribed period is 28 days for Australian residents and 90 days for residents of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (other than an application for ART review of a care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision) (CSRC Act section 90). An ART decision is final if an appeal has not been made within the prescribed period. A decision of a court is final if an appeal is not made within the time allowed for doing so by the relevant court.

# 10.4.7 The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977


## Context


A person aggrieved by certain administrative decisions made under Commonwealth legislation can apply to the Federal Court of Australia, or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2), for a review of that decision. This process allows for judicial review only. Merits review is available through other mechanisms (see below).


## Act reference


Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977


## Applying for judicial review of a decision


TheAdministrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977(ADJR Act) allows a parent (1.1.P.10) to apply to the Federal Court or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) for judicial review of most of the Registrar's administrative decisions. The ADJR Act applies to all of the Registrar's decisions under the CSRC Act and all CSA Act decisions except for determinations made under CSA Act Part 6A (that is, decisions on a parent's application to change a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) or on a Registrar initiated change of assessment (1.1.C.50)) (Part 5). The exclusion of determinations under CSA Act Part 6A is provided for by the ADJR Act at paragraph/s of Schedule 1.


The Federal Court of Australia or the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) can transfer the proceedings in relation to the Registrar's decisions to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) if it believes it is appropriate.


## Parties to the application


The Registrar is the respondent to a parent's application for review under the ADJR Act. The court can decide to join the other parent to the proceedings if it believes this is appropriate.


## The court's review


The ADJR Act provides that the court will review a decision by considering whether the decision maker hasproperly made that decision according to law. The court cannot review the merits of the decision, by considering whether the decision was the best exercise of the decision maker's discretion. A merits review can be pursued by objecting to the decision (10.2) and subsequently applying to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of the objection (1.1.O.10) decision if dissatisfied with that decision.


## Decision making according to the law


The court can conclude that a decision was not made according to law if satisfied that any of the following circumstances apply (ADJR Act section 5):

• the decision was made in a way that was not procedurally fair, for example, the decision maker failed to provide either parent with an opportunity to comment on the information that was taken into account in a way that is adverse to them, or if the decision maker was biased
• the decision maker did not follow procedures that were required by law when they made the decision
• the person who purported to make the decision did not have the power to make the decision
• the decision could not be made under the relevant legislation
• the decision maker used the decision making power in an improper way and not for the purpose intended by the relevant legislation
• the decision maker made a mistake about the law that applied to the facts of the case
• the decision was made or affected by fraud
• there was no evidence or other material to justify the decision, or
• the decision was otherwise contrary to law.

## Using a decision making power in an improper way


A decision maker will use their power in an improper way if they:

• take something into account that was not relevant to the decision
• fail to consider something that was relevant to their decision
• make the decision for a different purpose than the one conferred by the legislation
• make a decision involving discretion in bad faith
• make a decision involving discretion at the direction or request of another person
• make a decision according to a policy without taking into account the circumstances of the case
• make a decision that no reasonable person could have made
• make a decision that leads to an uncertain outcome, or
• abuse their power in some other way.

## No evidence to support a decision


A decision will have no evidence to support it if:

• the decision maker could only make that decision if a particular matter is established and there is no material from which they could reasonably be satisfied that the matter is established, or
• the decision maker based the decision on a particular finding of fact and that finding was wrong.

## The court's power to change a decision


The court can set aside the original decision, in whole or in part, if it is satisfied that the decision was not made according to law. The court cannot replace the decision with a preferable decision. If the court sets the Registrar's original decision aside, it will return the matter to the Registrar for a new decision to be made, subject to directions, if appropriate.


## Effect of application on the original decision


The Registrar's decision continues to have effect after a parent makes an application under the ADJR Act until the court makes a decision on that application. The Registrar or the other parent may take action to enforce the decision unless the court issues a stay order (1.1.S.70) in relation to that decision.

# 11.1.1 Child Support Registrar's powers


## Context


The Child Support Registrar (the Registrar) holds statutory powers and functions under the CSA Act and the CSRC Act.


## Act references


## Description


The Registrar is authorised by Parliament, through the CSA Act and the CSRC Act, to make decisions on child support cases under those Acts.


The Registrar cannot personally make every decision on every child support case. In practice, most decisions are made by officers and employees of Services Australia. These people are either exercising a power delegated directly to them by the Registrar, or have been authorised by the Registrar (or the Registrar's delegate) to exercise their power (or delegated power) on their behalf.

# 11.1.3 Authorisation to make decision on another's behalf


## Context


The Registrar has issued a written authorisation to enable certain Services Australia officers to make decisions on behalf of the Registrar.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 15, section 61


## Description


The Registrar has signed an instrument of authorisation that covers most of the decision-making powers in the CSA Act and the CSRC Act. This instrument authorises officers to make particular types of decisions on the basis of their position. The instrument of authorisation itemises the levels at which decisions can be made under the CSA Act and the CSRC Act. An officer who makes a decision under an authorisation is doing so as an agent of the person who holds the power to make the decision (that is, the Registrar).


The CSRC Act also provides that an officer authorised by the Registrar may enter an employer's premises to inspect records for the purposes of collecting child support (1.1.C.60) from salary and wages. The Registrar, or a delegate of the Registrar, provides these officers with a personal written authority for this to occur.

# 11.1.6 Forwarding documents & substituted service


## Context


In limited circumstances, Services Australia can assist a parent (1.1.P.10) who does not know the address of the other parent by forwarding documents to that other parent. Documents may also be forwarded to and for non-parent carers.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 4, section 150


CSRC Actsection 3, section 16


## On this page

• The purposes and objects of the child support legislation
• Service of legal documents
• Court-ordered substituted service
• Forwarding other documents

## The purposes & objects of the child support legislation


The secrecy provisions in the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation prevent the Registrar from disclosing a person's address to any other person, including the other parent (11.4). However, Services Australia can forward a document to a parent at the request of the other parent or another person if it is necessary to do so for the purposes of the child support legislation, or where forwarding the documents will further the objects of the legislation.


## Service of legal documents


Services Australia will pass on legal documents that relate to any proceedings under or related to the child support legislation. This is necessary for a person to exercise their rights under the child support legislation. The following types of legal proceedings are under or related to the child support legislation:

• Legal proceedings under the CSA Act or the CSRC Act
• Legal proceedings for judicial review of Registrar decisions under theAdministrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977or theJudiciary Act 1903
• Legal proceedings under the FL Act for the variation of a registered maintenance liability
• Legal proceedings under the FL Act about parenting which may vary the care percentage resulting in a change to the liability
• Legal proceedings under the FL Act about parentage which may establish that a person is, or is not, a parent of the child of the assessment

When Services Australia receives documents from a parent or their solicitor with a request that they be forwarded to the other parent, Services Australia must examine the documents and be satisfied that they contain information that is relevant to the proceedings and no other information.


Services Australia will forward the documents by registered mail to the parent's last known address. The officer who mailed the document will swear an affidavit that the document has been posted in that manner and return it to the person who asked Services Australia to forward the document. It is not necessary for the officer to wait for certification that the mail has been successfully delivered.


This process is referred to as substituted service.


The Registrar can also serve documents on a person in Australia on behalf of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) where it is necessary and convenient to do so for the purposes of an international maintenance arrangement (CSRC Regs section 32).


## Court-ordered substituted service


The Registrar will comply with any court order for substituted service regarding any court proceedings.


The method of service is the same as for other substituted services.


## Forwarding other documents


Services Australia will forward other types of documents to a parent when it will further the objects of the legislation. Documents of this type may include (but are not limited to):

• draft child support agreements
• proposals for agreements to change a court ordered maintenance liability
• a letter from a Family Relationship Centre requesting a parent to make contact to commence family dispute resolution, or
• a letter from a parent's solicitor inviting the other parent to sign a statutory declaration or consent to DNA testing so that the matter can be resolved before going to court.

Services Australia will examine the documents to be satisfied that they contain information that is relevant and do not contain threatening or offensive material.


Services Australia will not forward these documents if they are aware that there are any court orders in place that prevent contact between the parents. This may include apprehended violence orders made under the legislation of a state or territory, or protection orders made under the FL Act.


For other cases where there is information that indicates family violence, Services Australia will only forward the documents if the other parent consents to receiving them. Services Australia will make every effort to contact the other parent and obtain their consent for the document to be forwarded.


Services Australia will send the documents by ordinary mail to the parent's last known address. Confirmation in writing that the document has been forwarded will be sent to the person who asked Services Australia to forward the document.

# 11.1.4 Compensation, act of grace & waiver of debts


## Context


In certain circumstances, a parent may be eligible for compensation from the Commonwealth for mistakes made in the management of their case, or may be eligible for waiver of a debt owed to the Commonwealth where the collection of that debt would be considered inequitable, or would cause ongoing financial hardship.


Act of grace payments and waivers of debt are ‘last resort’ mechanisms, which will generally only be considered once alternate remedies have been sought.


## On this page

• Types of compensation
• Waiver of a debt owed to the Commonwealth
• How to make a claim
• Settlement of claims

## Types of compensation


The Commonwealth has a number of discretionary mechanisms to address financial impacts of decisions of the Commonwealth that have an unintended, unfair, unreasonable or inappropriate impact.


### Act of grace payment


An Act of grace payment is generally a remedy of last resort and is not used when there is another viable remedy available to provide redress in the circumstances giving rise to the application.


An act of grace payment can only be approved by the Finance Minister or authorised delegates of the Department of Finance (PGPA Act section 65).


Information about the act of grace mechanism is available on the Services Australia website 'Claiming compensation from us' or the Department of Finance website 'Act of grace mechanism'.


### Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA) scheme


The CDDA scheme allows Commonwealth agencies to consider and provide compensation for inappropriate actions (defective administration) by that agency that has caused a loss (detriment).


Information about discretionary compensation mechanisms is available on the Services Australia website'Claiming compensation from us' or theDepartment of Finance website.


## Waiver of a debt owed to the Commonwealth


A person may owe a debt to the Commonwealth, for example, a child support debt (1.1.C.90) or a debt arising from an overpayment (1.1.O.20) of child support (1.1.C.60).


Requests for a waiver are considered on a case-by-case basis. A waiver may be appropriate where recovery of the debt would be inequitable, or recovery of the debt would cause ongoing financial hardship. A debt is unlikely to be waived where it is a debt that is owed to the Commonwealth that will be paid on to a third party.


A debt owing to the Commonwealth can only be waived by the Finance Minister or authorised delegates of the Department of Finance (PGPA Act section 63).


The waiver powers are intended to be used in a limited number of cases to ensure equity in the impact of Government activities.


## How to make a claim


If a person believes that they are entitled to compensation they need to apply in writing.


A request for a CDDA payment can be made to Services Australia.


A request for anact of grace paymentcan be made directly to the Department of Finance using the Application for an act of grace payment form. The Department of Finance will notify Services Australia when an application for an act of grace payment is received.


A request forwaiver of a Commonwealth debtcan be made directly to the Department of Finance using theApplication for a Waiver of Debt owed to the Governmentform. The Department of Finance will notify Services Australia when a request for waiver is received.


## Settlement of claims


Services Australia can only spend public monies in the ways specified by thePublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013(PGPA Act) and thePublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014.


The policy for payment of legal claims is set out in theLegal Services Directions 2017at Appendix C - Handling monetary claims. The principles for deciding and settling claims are set out in Appendix B - The Commonwealth's obligation to act as a model litigant.

# 11.2 Collecting information


## Introduction


This chapter explains how Services Australia obtains information to administer the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation.


The Child Support Registrar can compel a person to provide information, to attend and answer questions and to produce documents. Services Australia can also gain access to employer records. However, most information Services Australia uses is obtained from parents (1.1.P.10) or third parties without compulsion.

# 11.2.1 Information does not need to be in writing


## Context


Generally, the Registrar or delegated officer in Services Australia will accept information in other than written form wherever it is practical to do so. Exceptions to this policy occur where:

• there arelegal or other requirementsthat the information be taken in writing
• there arespecific circumstancesthat suggest information should be taken in writing.

This page also describes the different forms of information that the Registrar may receive and consider and certain information that cannot be considered.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 80C, section 80E, section 98B(1), section 150A, section 151B

## On this page

• Legal or other requirements that information be provided in writing
• Specific circumstances that suggest information should be provided in writing
• Consideration of photographic and other forms of information

## Legal or other requirements that information be provided in writing


Legislative or other requirements mean that the types of information listed below must be taken in writing.

• Child support (1.1.C.60) agreements: Child support agreements must be in writing and be signed by both parties (CSA Act section 80C and section 80E). A parent's (1.1.P.10) application for acceptance of their child support agreement does not have to be in writing. However, where parents want to extend an agreement to the end of a school year in which a child turns 18, both parents must sign the application (CSA Act section 151B(2)).
• Application for change of assessment (1.1.C.50): An application for a change of assessment must be made in writing (CSA Act section 98B(1)).
• Objections (1.1.O.10) and associated notices and applications for extension of time: An objection and a response by the other parent must be made in writing (CSRC Act section 80 and section 86). However, an objection to a care percentage (1.1.C.20) decision and a response by the other parent are not required to be lodged in writing (CSRC Act section 80(6) and section 86A).
• Statutory declarations: Statutory declarations are required to be made in writing and to be sworn before a witness authorised under the relevant state legislation.

A person can provide information to the Registrar in writing by sending it to Services Australia in the mail, sending it by facsimile, or arranging for it to be personally delivered to a Services Australia office. A person can also send written information to the Registrar by email or through theServices Australiawebsite (Electronic Transactions Act 1999section 8). If sending an application for a change of assessment via online services, the form must be signed before it is scanned and sent.


## Specific circumstances that suggest information should be provided in writing


Apart from the situations mentioned above, the Registrar can specify how an application, notice, election or reply must be made (CSA Act section 150A and CSRC Act section 16A).


Services Australia will accept information in other than written form (apart frominformation that must be taken in writing) except where specific circumstances suggest the information should be provided in writing.


Specific factors related to the case or the context in which the information is being provided may mean that information that will generally be accepted in other than written form should be requested in writing. Services Australia will consider the following:

• The parties exchanging the information must be comfortable with giving the information in other than written form. Services Australia officers will not insist that information be provided in other than written form. It is an option for parents. Parents who prefer to provide information in writing can do so. Services Australia officers may suggest that completing the appropriate form would be a better option in circumstances where there are communication difficulties.
• The parties exchanging the information must be confident that the information is reliable. When making a record of information provided in a form other than in writing, Services Australia officers may read back to the person the information they have provided and ask the person to confirm it. Services Australia officers will explain how the information being provided by a parent may affect their child support assessment (1.1.C.70) or obligations. Where a parent has provided information other than in writing in the past, but has later retracted or amended the information, Services Australia officers may suggest that the information would be better provided in writing.
• The parties exchanging the information must be confident that the information is readily capable of being understood. Complex factual situations may be best dealt with in writing. In many complicated situations, conversation helps to clarify the situation. In other situations, it is better to deal with the issue in writing. Services Australia officers will exercise judgment to decide whether the situation is complex and whether it is best dealt with in writing, by discussion, or by a combination of both.
• The parties exchanging the information should be confident that the information is not being given under duress. Services Australia officers will not accept information from a person where it seems that they have provided the information under duress. The officer receiving the information should be confident that the person providing the information fully understands the effect that the information will have on their child support assessment or obligations. Before accepting information, the officer will explain to the person how the information will affect their child support assessment or obligations, and the extent and manner of any disclosure to the other parent. The officer will assist with obtaining advice on how the information provided may affect their Centrelink benefits. Services Australia officers will suggest that parents seek independent legal advice where appropriate.

Services Australia officers will check a parent's identity (11.4.5) when obtaining information.


Where an application or election can be made other than in written form, the effect of the Registrar accepting the information in another form is the same as the person making a written application or election. The date that all the relevant information was obtained is the date of lodgement of that application or election.


Services Australia officers will arrange to have the appropriate form sent to a parent where it is not practical to take the information in a form other than in writing.


## Consideration of photographic & other forms of information


Services Australia usually receives information in either written or oral form. In some cases, a person may provide photographic or other forms of information as evidence in support of their claims. Generally, Services Australia will consider all information provided regardless of its form.


There is no law or regulation that states that evidence must be provided in any particular form. All information, whether documentary, oral, or photographic in nature, falls within the scope of evidence and records for the purposes of Commonwealth operations.


Screen-captures and prints of internet pages (for example, a person's business website or Facebook page, YouTube videos, LinkedIn pages, etc.) may also be relevant information that Services Australia may consider.


As with information of all kinds, photographic or video evidence may be relevant, although may not be conclusive of anything. The Registrar will consider a photograph or video that purports to be evidence of something as no less authoritative than a written statement making the same assertion. A decision maker considering such evidence will take the same steps and conduct the same enquiries as for any other evidence to satisfy themselves of the relevance, accuracy, and veracity of the information provided.


Services Australia will exchange information (whether photographic or otherwise) with the other party where required by law or to ensure that procedural fairness is afforded to both parties (for example, during a change of assessment (5.6.1) or objection process (10.2)).

# 11.1.5 Freedom of information


## Context


Wherever possible, documents will be made available to a person without requiring them to apply under theFreedom of Information Act 1982(FOI Act). This topic explains when a person will be required to formally request access under the FOI Act and how to make such a request.


## Act references


Freedom of Information Act 1982


Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010


## On this page


Information about the child support (1.1.C.60)scheme, including child support forms, brochures, booklets and policy, are freely available to the public. Many of these documents are available on theServices Australiawebsite or theDepartment of Social Serviceswebsite.


Also, requests are often received from parents (1.1.P.10) and stakeholders who seek access to other documents held by Services Australia orDSS. Access to documents will be provided without the formalities of a request under the FOI Act, where possible.


In some situations a formal request under the FOI Act will be required.

• Informal requests
• Formal requests under the FOI Act

## Informal requests


Most requests for access to information are made to Services Australia, who deliver services to child support paying parents and payees (1.1.P.30) under the scheme. The Services Australia operational guidelines, policies, procedures and training materials are available to the public upon request through theInformation Publication Scheme.


Copies of documents that have been sent to Services Australia (including letters and forms) can be made available to the person who sent them. Services Australia will also provide records of conversations with staff on the request of the person involved in the call and will provide copies of court orders and agreements to the parents involved.


Where there is an informal request for large amounts of information, an administrative decision may be made to not process the request. However, the person making the request is still able to lodge a formal freedom of information request.


Example:Mark asks for a copy of the child support agreement and the application for acceptance form that he lodged. An officer sends Mark a copy after deleting personal details of any other person which may have been recorded on it (for example,TFN, address, phone number, department identifier).


## Formal requests under the FOI Act


Generally, where a request includes documents containing information about other people, a request under the FOI Act is needed. This includes requests for copies of letters, or records of telephone conversations about another person or the other parent. Also, secrecy provisions (11.4.3) contained in child support legislation will apply to documents containing third party information and could result in the information or document requested being exempt under the FOI Act.


Example:Leyla requests access to the 'whole department file' involving Leyla. As the Services Australia records for Leyla's child support entitlement would include documents containing information about third parties, a freedom of information request would be necessary.


If the work involved in processing the request would require a substantial and unreasonable diversion of resources, a decision may be made to refuse the request. In such circumstances, an applicant is provided the opportunity to revise the scope of the request.


Further information about making a formal freedom of information request related to service delivery or policy matters may be obtained from the Services Australia and DSS websites respectively.

# 11.1.7 Subpoenas & notices to provide documents


## Context


A court may issue a subpoena which requires the Registrar to produce information about a person. The Registrar may also be served with a notice to produce documents to a party to court proceedings.

• What is a notice to produce documents?
• Is a Commonwealth information order or a location order the same as a subpoena?

## What is a subpoena?


A subpoena is a court document issued at the request of a party to court proceedings. A subpoena requires a person to produce documents or to attend court to give evidence in those proceedings. A subpoena is an order for someone to provide information to a court. It does not require them to provide the information to a party to the court proceedings.


A court can impose penalties upon a person who fails to comply with a subpoena. This can include a warrant for the person's arrest (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021rule 6.41).


## When is a subpoena valid?


A subpoena is valid if:

• it is served properly, and
• the person who asked the court to issue it provides conduct money.

The person who asked the court to issue the subpoena is responsible for serving it. They do this by delivering a sealed copy of the subpoena to the person who is required to attend court to give evidence or provide copies of documents. If the subpoena is in relation to giving evidence in court, the subpoena must be served personally (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules rule 6.30, Division 2.6.2).


Where the subpoena requires the Registrar to produce documents, a Services Australia officer can accept service on the Registrar's behalf.


A subpoena is generally required to be served at least 7 days before the person is required to produce the documents to the court or attend the court to give evidence. If insufficient time has been given to comply with a subpoena or the date nominated is highly inconvenient, an extension of time for complying with the subpoena can be sought.


The person named in the subpoena is entitled to 'conduct money' from the person who asked the court to issue it. Conduct money is an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the named person's return travel to the court from home or their place of employment, as appropriate. It is not meant to cover the cost of searching, collating or copying documents. The Registrar will refund any conduct money to the person if they decide not to call on the subpoena.


## When will the Registrar comply with a subpoena?


The Registrar will comply with a valid subpoena by providing documents or evidence to a court:

• if required to do so, or
• if it is in the public interest for the Registrar to comply.

In deciding whether to comply, the Registrar has to take into account obligations to protect personal information under the:

• secrecy provisions in the child support legislation
• Privacy Act 1988and Australian Privacy Principles, and
• Public Service Act 1999and Public Service Regulations 2023.

### Secrecy provisions in the child support legislation


It is an offence for an officer or employee to provide protected information about a person to another person. Protected information is any personal information that employees or contractors obtain in the course of their duties (11.4).


It is not an offence under the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation for an employee to provide information to a court, because a court is not a person (Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Nestle Australia Limited(1986) FCA 368). However, unless the information is necessary for the purposes of the child support legislation, the Registrar is not required to provide it (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Act section 150(5)). This means that the Registrar can be required to comply with a subpoena that relates to an action under the child support legislation, but only where the documents or information required is necessary for the purposes of that legislation.


### Privacy Act & Australian Privacy Principles


The Privacy Act permits disclosure of personal information if the disclosure is authorised by law. If the Registrar provides information to a court under a subpoena this does not breach the Privacy Act (section 14 andAustralian Privacy Principle6 of Schedule 1). The information is required by law under the subpoena and the secrecy provisions in the child support legislation do not prevent the release of information to a court.


### Public Service Act & Regulations


The Public Service Act and Regulations set out a code of conduct for employees in the Australian Public Service (Public Service Act section 13 and Public Service Regulations Part 2). An officer or employee must not give or disclose information they obtained in the course of their duties to any person, directly or indirectly, except if they do so in the course of their duties.


If an officer provides information to a court under a subpoena they must comply with their responsibilities under the Public Service Act.


### When is the Registrar required to provide information or documents to a court?


The Registrar is required to comply with a subpoena that relates to an action under the child support legislation, but only where the documents or information required are necessary for the purposes of that legislation (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Act section 150(5)).


When served with a subpoena, the Registrar must establish whether the subpoena relates to proceedings taken by either the payer or payee that are for the purposes of the CSA Act or the CSRC Act. The term 'purpose' is not defined in the legislation.


Generally, it will mean that the application to the court is brought under one of the provisions of the CSA Act or the CSRC Act. An application for judicial review of a decision under the CSA Act or the CSRC Act would also be proceedings for the purposes of the child support legislation (10.4).


Proceedings under the FL Act such as those relating to property settlements, are not proceedings for the purposes of the child support legislation, even though the result may have some effect on the person's child support.


Secondly, the Registrar only needs to provide protected documents that contain personal information about the other parent in the case to the court if it is necessary for the purposes of the child support legislation.


The Registrar will carefully examine the documents required by a subpoena to decide whether they are necessary for the purposes of the child support legislation. What is necessary will depend on the nature of the document and the type of proceedings.


Example:Petra has applied to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia for a declaration under CSA Act section 106A that Lewis should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because Lewis is a parent of the child, and therefore Petra would be entitled to an assessment of child support payable by Lewis. The Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia issues a subpoena, at Petra's request, requiring the Registrar to produce documents that include information from financial institutions about Lewis's loans and accounts. Financial information is not relevant to these proceedings. Even though there are proceedings under the CSA Act the information is not necessary for the purposes of that Act.


### When will it be in the public interest for the Registrar to comply with a subpoena?


There may be occasions where the Registrar is not required to comply with a subpoena but it would be in the public interest for the Registrar to provide the information to the court. As the secrecy provisions in the child support legislation and the provisions of the Privacy Act and the Public Service Act and regulations do not prevent the Registrar from providing information to a court, the Registrar may provide information to a court under a subpoena if the interests of justice outweigh the interference with personal privacy.


## The form in which the Registrar will provide information to the court


In all cases where a person has indicated that they intend to call on a subpoena, the Registrar will gather all relevant original documents, or copies, containing the information covered by the subpoena and bring, or send, them to the court. If documents provided to the court contain protected information, the Registrar will advise the court of the nature of the information and any known sensitivities.


The Registrar will formally oppose production of any material not necessary for the purposes of the child support legislation or may apply to the court to have the subpoena set aside if the information sought is not relevant, is oppressive or too burdensome, is too wide, or is privileged.


The Registrar will usually be legally represented and will seek an order for legal costs for appearance in court.


The Registry of the court that issued the subpoena will hold any documents that the Registrar produces until the proceedings are finalised.


## What is a notice to produce documents?


The Registrar may also be served with a notice to produce documents (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules rule 6.09, rule 6.18).


A notice to produce documents is different from a subpoena as it requires that the specified documents be provided to the requesting party rather than a court. Notices to produce are also usually issued in preliminary stages of court proceedings.


The requesting party is required to serve a copy of the notice to produce on the other parties in the matter. Both the person served, and the other parties are given an opportunity to object to the court.


If the documents requested in a notice to produce contain protected information about another person (seeSecrecy provisions in the child support legislation, above), the Registrar cannot produce them to the requesting party. Where the Registrar is not able to comply, the Registrar will object to production of the documents sought. The Registrar will usually be legally represented and will seek an order for legal costs for appearance in court.


## Is a Commonwealth information order or a location order the same as a subpoena?


No. A court can make an order requiring the Registrar to provide information about a child's location (FL Act section 67J). These orders are referred to as Commonwealth information orders or location orders. The secrecy provisions in the child support legislation also make it clear that the Registrar must comply with Commonwealth information orders or location orders (CSRC Act section 16(9) and CSA Act section 150(9)) (11.4).

# 11.1.2 Delegation of powers


## Context


The Registrar has delegated statutory powers under the child support legislation and other Acts to certain officers.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 15, Part VII


CSA Actsection 149, section 161, Part 6A


## Description


The CSA Act and CSRC Act explicitly authorise the Registrar to delegate statutory powers and functions under those Acts to officers or employees within Services Australia orDSS. The CSRC Act also explicitly authorises the Registrar to delegate statutory powers to persons engaged by the Registrar, an Agency (as defined by thePublic Service Act 1999), another authority of the Commonwealth, or an organisation that performs services for the Commonwealth.


The Registrar has delegated powers under written instruments issued under the CSA Act and the CSRC Act (except the power to delegate) to certain managers, directors and executive officers within Services Australia. Delegates can exercise a delegated power in their own names and according to their own discretion.


The Registrar has also authorised certain managers to review and alter decisions of all other delegates under that instrument.


The Registrar has also delegated powers for decision makers to depart from administrative assessment of child support and to obtain information and evidence to deal with change of assessment applications and to hear objections to those decisions. This delegation is subject to a power of review and alteration, with the Registrar able to change a decision made under that delegation within a period of 6 years of that decision being made.

# 11.2.3 Information gathering powers under the CSA Act


## Context


The Registrar has statutory powers to obtain information for the purposes of making and varying child support assessments (1.1.C.70).


## Act references


CSA Actsection 160, section 161, section 162A


## Obtaining information & evidence


The Registrar can give a notice to a person requiring them to notify Services Australia within 14 days, and in the manner specified in the notice (CSA Act section 160), if:

• a specified event or change of circumstances happens, or
• the person becomes aware that a specified event or change of circumstances is likely to happen.

Only events that might affect the payment of child support (1.1.C.60) or the rate at which it is payable can be specified in the notice.


The Registrar can also require a person to:

• provide information (CSA Act section 161(1)(a))
• attend and answer questions (CSA Act section 161(1)(b)), and
• produce documents (CSA Act section 161(1)(c)).

These powers must be exercised for the purposes of the CSA Act.


Example:The Registrar must not use the powers contained in the CSA Act to obtain information to enforce payment.


A person who is required to attend under section 161(1)(b) (other than a payer (1.1.P.40), payee (1.1.P.30), or their representative) is entitled to expenses (CSA Act section 161(2) and CSA Regs section 17).


A notice must also be properly served on the person (11.5.1) and must give the person a reasonable time to comply. What is a reasonable time will depend on the type and extent of the information sought.


The Registrar will not collect information that is not necessary for child support purposes or intrudes unreasonably on a person's privacy (see information about the Privacy Act 1988 in11.4).


Whilst it can be appropriate to seek information from other departments via informal arrangements, a notice can be issued to another government department. However, there will be instances where secrecy provisions and/or privacy obligations will prevent other departments from disclosing information in the absence of legal authority to do so.


The Registrar may collect and use information from third parties (11.4.4).


## Obtaining information from residents of reciprocating jurisdictions


Where a person is or was resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (1.5.1), and the Registrar does not have sufficient information to determine that person's overseas income, a notice may be sent to the person or to the relevant overseas authority requesting any information or documents that are necessary to enable the person's overseas income to be determined (CSA Act section 162A(1)).


Where the payer or payee is resident overseas in a reciprocating jurisdiction, a notice can be given to the person who is resident overseas or to the overseas authority (1.1.O.30) (1.5.1) in the relevant reciprocating jurisdiction requesting them to notify the Registrar within 60 days and in the manner specified in the notice (CSA Act section 162A(2)), if:

• a specified event or change of circumstances happens, or
• the person becomes aware that a specified event or change of circumstances is likely to happen.

Only events that might affect the payment of child support or the rate at which it is payable can be specified in the notice (CSA Act section 162A(3)).

# 11.2.4 Information gathering powers under the CSRC Act


## Context


The Registrar has statutory powers to obtain information for the purposes of collecting child support (1.1.C.60). A court can also use these powers to obtain information if a payee (1.1.P.30) is exercising their right to enforce a debt via court proceedings (8.4.6).

• provide information (CSRC Act section 120(1)(a))
• attend and answer questions (CSRC Act section 120(1)(b)), and
• produce documents (CSRC Act section 120(1)(c)).

These powers can only be exercised for the purposes of the CSRC Act.


A person who is required to attend under section 120(1)(b) of the CSRC Act (other than a payer (1.1.P.40), payee, or their representative) is entitled to expenses (CSRC Act section 120(2) and CSRC Regs section 27).

# 11.2.5 Access to employer records


## Context


The Registrar can access the wage or payroll records of an employer.


## Act references


## Description


The Registrar's power to access employer records can only be used to access the salary or wage records (including information stored on a computer) of a payer's employer for the purpose of applying the employer withholding (1.1.E.20) provisions.


Officers, authorised in writing by the Registrar, have the power to enter employers' premises and to access documents (section 61(1)). Officers can inspect, examine, take extracts from, or make copies of, any documents that are relevant to the payer (1.1.P.40). They cannot gather information on any other person. Officers cannot remove documents.


This access only applies to premises where the employer's records are kept (usually the employer's business premises). Where the relevant salary and wage records are in some other place (for example, the offices of the employer's accountant or the employer's home) officers may access those premises.


Authorised officers do not have power under the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation to access the premises of banks and other financial institutions, parents (1.1.P.10), or any other third party. Officers can only access the premises of a bank or financial institution where the institution is the employer of the payer and the salary and wages records are held on the premises.


An officer seeking entry to an employer's premises must produce a current authority signed by the Registrar. The authority must identify the officer and state that the officer is authorised to exercise the Registrar's powers under section 61. Officers who do not produce an authority cannot enter or remain on the land or premises if requested to leave (section 61(2)).


If an employer wants to obtain professional advice, the search should be postponed temporarily. Officers should make arrangements to ensure there is no tampering with the records (for example, the documents or copies of the documents could be sealed in an envelope or box with both the custodian of the papers and the officers signing an undertaking not to open the item until the advice has been received).


Any claim that the records are subject to legal professional privilege (11.2.6) will be resisted on the grounds that wage records are created to record payments to employees, not for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.


The employer may commit an offence if they do not provide reasonable facilities and assistance to an authorised officer (section 61(3)) (11.6).


Although the access provisions do not grant a right to conduct an interview, many interviews proceed on an informal basis without recourse to a formal notice. These informal discussions will usually reduce the cost of compliance, as the person is not required to attend the office for an interview or to produce the required records under a formal notice (11.2.4).


Employers can refuse to answer any questions other than those specifically related to the location of records. Where officers have reasonable grounds for requiring the employer to answer other questions about the documents and the employer is unwilling to reply informally, the officer can later prepare and issue a notice under the appropriate information and evidence-gathering provision.

# 11.2.6 Legal professional privilege


## Context


When Services Australia officers seek information, an employer, parent (1.1.P.10) or third party may claim that legal professional privilege applies to the document or information.


## Act references


## Description


Information disclosed to a lawyer does not become privileged, merely because it has been disclosed to a lawyer. Legal professional privilege as defined by theLaw Council of Australia:

• is a common law right that exists to protect the administration of justice and the right of individuals and other entities/organisations to obtain confidential advice about their legal circumstances
• protects communications between client and practitioner relating to the provision of legal advice and the advice given by a lawyer to their client (advice privilege), and communications pertaining to actual or contemplated litigation or court proceedings (litigation privilege).

The Registrar's statutory powers to obtain information provided in CSRC Act do not override legal professional privilege (Daniels Corp International v ACCC(2002) HCA 49).


Wherever possible, the Registrar will avoid disputes over legal professional privilege. Accordingly, Services Australia officers will:

• seek information and documents from the parent concerned rather than their lawyer, and
• avoid using information-gathering powers in a way that may lead to claims of privilege if there is an alternative means of obtaining the information.

## Access to employer records


Wage records are not considered communications when obtaining legal advice or concerning litigation. The Registrar will oppose any claim of legal professional privilege regarding wage records.


## Requirements to provide information or attend & answer questions


The CSA Act and the CSRC Act provide the Registrar with statutory powers to require a person to provide information or to answer questions. Claims of legal professional privilege are unlikely to occur when exercising these powers.


Example:Miguel is seeking advice about a property settlement and provides a list of assets to a lawyer while obtaining legal advice. Miguel cannot refuse to provide details of the assets or refuse to answer questions about the assets based on legal professional privilege, which applies to Miguel's communication to the lawyer, not Miguel's knowledge of the assets.


## Requirements to produce documents


Claims of legal professional privilege are more likely to be encountered when the Registrar requires documents to be produced. Generally, the Registrar will not be interested in the communication of information to a lawyer or the advice received from a lawyer.


Example:Cristian is seeking advice about a property settlement and draws up a list of assets. Cristian provides the list of assets and copies of bank statements to a lawyer when obtaining legal advice. Cristian can claim privilege in relation to the list provided to the lawyer. Cristian would not be able to claim privilege in relation to the bank statements. The list is a communication, the bank statements are not. While the list may attract privilege, the Registrar can still seek details of the assets from Cristian under the power to provide information or attend and answer questions.

# 11.3 Correction of errors under the CSA Act & CSRC Act


## Act references


## On this page

• Background
• Extent of the Registrar’s discretion
• Advising affected parents of an error
• Deciding whether or not to correct an error
• Error correction is not an objection

## Background


The Registrar has the power to amend an assessment or vary the Child Support Register to correct any error or mistake (CSA Act section 75, CSRC Act section 42), whether or not made by the Registrar.


## Extent of Registrar’s discretion


The Registrar has discretion to correct an error or mistake. If the Registrar identifies there is an error, the Registrar must decide whether the error should be corrected or left uncorrected (seeDeciding whether or not to correct an errorbelow).


## Advising affected parents (1.1.P.10) of an error


The Registrar will in all circumstances notify affected parents of identified errors. The Registrar will notify affected parents if they have decided to correct the error or if they decided not to correct the error. The Registrar may choose to advise affected parents of an error before deciding whether to correct (or not) the error where:

• it is necessary to establish the facts
• the error will have a significant impact on the parents, or
• for any other reason the Registrar considers relevant.

When notifying parents about an error (and any decision in relation to that error), the Registrar will also notify them that they may, subject to the CSRC Act, object to the particulars of the assessment, or certain decisions under the CSA or the CSRC Act.


Example:Ashley and Jamie are assessed in respect of the costs of child Claude. The Registrar mistakenly records Ashley'sATIas $190,000 when it is actually $19,000. The Registrar becomes aware of their error on the day after making the error. The Registrar immediately decides to correct the error and amends the assessment accordingly. The Registrar then advises the parents of the error, the decision to correct the error, and their review rights.


## Deciding whether or not to correct an error


When deciding whether to correct (or not) an error, the Registrar will consider the objects of the Acts and the legislative requirements of the decision affected by the error. The Registrar can also consider circumstances including, but not limited to, the wishes of the affected parents, the integrity of the child support (1.1.C.60) scheme, and the impact on each parent of correcting or not correcting the error.


Error correction decisions are made in the context of the particular circumstances of each case. The circumstances in one case may mean it is appropriate to correct an error in that case, but it may not be appropriate to correct a similar error in another case.


The Registrar may be more likely to decide to correct an error where:

• it is an obvious error of fact, and can be fixed simply
• it impacts the current assessment or liability
• both parents want the error corrected
• one parent wants the error corrected and the other parent does not want it corrected
• the Registrar caused the error or substantially contributed to it
• one parent wants the error corrected and the other parent cannot be contacted.

The Registrar may be less likely to decide to correct an error where:

• neither parent wants the error to be corrected
• there will be no material change to an assessment or financial impact as a result of correcting the error
• only one of the affected parents is contactable and they do not want the error corrected
• there is no utility to correcting the error, or it would be inappropriate to correct – such as when the error is the subject of merits or judicial review proceedings (whether internal or external to Services Australia).

Example:In October 2023, the Registrar becomes aware of a system error that affected Segun’s income for the period January 2015 to April 2017. The error has a significant financial impact on the assessment for a past period but, does not affect the current liability. After becoming aware of the error, the Registrar advises both parents of the error and their review rights. The Registrar has not yet considered whether to correct the error. Both parents separately advise the Registrar that they do not want the error corrected. The Registrar makes a decision to not correct the error. The Registrar then advises both parents of the decision to not correct the error and their review rights for that decision.


## Error correction is not an objection


An objection (1.1.O.10) is not the same as correcting an error or mistake, even though correcting an error may change the outcome of a decision. It is more appropriate to lodge an objection to the Registrar's original decision for circumstances including if the facts are not clear or they are disputed, or if there is new information that one parent has not had an opportunity to comment upon. If a parent wishes to have a decision reconsidered, they can choose to seek review through the objections process (10.2).


Example:The Registrar decides to set Florence’s income via an income amount order (1.1.I.10) following an application for change of assessment (1.1.C.50) under Reason 8 initiated by Marie. In the notice of decision, the Registrar advises the decision was based in part on information about the value of certain assets owned by Florence. Florence states that the Registrar has misinterpreted the information and its relevance, and states that the Registrar has made an error which should be corrected.


The Registrar advises Florence that they should seek review by lodging an objection to the change of assessment decision.

# 11.4.1 Privacy Act


## Context


ThePrivacy Act 1988applies to individual privacy in both the public and private sectors.


## Act references


## Child support & the Privacy Act


Services Australia is subject to the Privacy Act, which protects the personal information that government and businesses collect about individuals. The Privacy Act established standards for information collection, storage, security, correction, use, disclosure and access. It also provides safeguards for the collection and use of tax file numbers.


Personal information includes any information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual.


The Privacy Act must be read in conjunction with other legislation, such as the secrecy provisions in the Child Support and Tax Acts. The secrecy provisions of those Acts are more stringent than the Privacy Act in regards to the disclosure of information.


More information about privacy can be found at theOffice of the Australian Information Commission'swebsite or theServices Australiawebsite.

# 11.5.1 Methods of service


## Context


Various provisions in the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation allow the Registrar to give a 'notice in writing' or a 'written notice'. A notice must be served on the person who is required to receive, or comply with, the notice.


'Service' is delivery to the person who will be affected by the notice. The essence of service is that the relevant document must reach the person on whom it is to be served (Holmes and Ors v DFC of T88 ATC 4906). A notice will be deemed to have been effectively served if it can be proven the addressee actually received it.


There are various ways, or methods a notice can be served on a person, but in most cases, the Registrar will serve a notice by post.


## Act references


Evidence Act 1995section 160, section 161, section 163


Electronic Transactions Act 1999section 5, section 14A

• Service by post
• Service by facsimile
• Service by electronic communication

## Personal service


Personal service is the most effective method for service of notices as there is direct evidence of receipt. However, it is not convenient or efficient to rely on personal service in all cases.


If a notice is personally served, Services Australia will generally use a process server.


The person served must be informed of the nature of the notice at the time it is handed to them. If a person refuses to take possession of the notice it can be left near them.


The person who served the notice should complete an affidavit of service (11.5.3).


Other available methods of service (CSA Regs section 19 and CSRC Regs section 31) are:

• leaving the notice at the person's address for service, or
• sending the notice by prepaid post to the person's address for service.

A company can be served by leaving a notice at, or mailing a notice to, the company's head office, registered office, or principal office.


## Service by post


If postal service is used, the notice can be sent by normal prepaid post, by express post or registered post.


Service by post is deemed to occur at the time it would arrive in the ordinary course of the post. In proceedings in relation to offences under the child support legislation, a notice is presumed to have been received 12 working days after the date it was prepared (Evidence Act 1995section 160 and section 163) unless it can be proven otherwise.


## Service by facsimile


In limited circumstances, notices will be served by facsimile if there is a pre-existing arrangement with the recipient to accept notices in that way. However, Services Australia will usually send notices by post.


As a backup for a posted notice, a copy of the notice may also be sent by facsimile. This may be particularly helpful if urgent service is necessary.


## Service by electronic communication


If a person consents to receiving notices or other communications by way of electronic communication, a notice can be served by leaving it at the person's designated electronic address. Express consent is not required but can be reasonably inferred (Electronic Transactions Act 1999section 5).


A notice can be served electronically by email or online. A notice is deemed to be received at the time it becomes capable of being retrieved from the person's email or online account (Electronic Transactions Act section 14A).

# 11.4.5 Proof of identity


## Context


Proof of identity checks help Services Australia comply with privacy law and the child support secrecy provisions that require the protection of the personal information of child support parents and carers.


## Need to prove identity


Services Australia requires proof of identity from parents, carers and their authorised representatives to avoid the possibility of disclosing protected information to a person who is not entitled or authorised to receive it.


Services Australia cannot require a person to provide theirTFNto establish or confirm their identity. TFNs are protected under subdivision BA of theTaxation Administration Act 1953and thePrivacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015(TFN Rule). The TFN Rule prohibits the use of TFNs to establish or confirm the identity of an individual for any purpose not authorised by taxation, personal assistance or superannuation law.


Services Australia does not need to establish the identity of a person before providing general information to them (for example, information about the Child Support Scheme, or the methods the Registrar uses to collect child support). However, Services Australia will not provide personal or protected information to a person if their identity cannot be established.

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 11.4.2 Tax file numbers & taxation information


## Context


Access to taxation information is essential for the effective assessment, collection and enforcement of child support (1.1.C.60). For example, child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are based on taxable income (1.1.T.20) as assessed by theATO, and the Registrar can collect debts by intercepting a tax refund (1.1.T.40).


The Registrar is permitted to useTFNs to obtain and exchange information with the ATO.

Taxation Administration Act 1953section 8WA, section 8WB, section 355-65


Privacy Act 1988section 13, section 17, section 18


## Authority to use taxation information


The exchange of information between Services Australia and the ATO is permitted by the secrecy provisions of the child support and taxation legislation (CSRC Act sections 16(2A), 16(3)(ca) and 16(6), CSA Act sections 150(2A), 150(3)(ca) and 150(6)). In addition, the child support legislation specifically authorises the Registrar to:

• request, but not compel, a person to provide a written statement of their TFN (CSRC Act section 16B, CSA Act section 150B)
• require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide information the Commissioner possesses about people, including TFNs, being information thatis in the possession of the Commissioner, ormay come into the possession of the Commissioner after the requirement is made (including information that comes into existence after the requirement is made). The requirement may be of a standing nature. (CSRC Act section 16C(1), CSA Act section 150D(1))
• is in the possession of the Commissioner, or
• may come into the possession of the Commissioner after the requirement is made (including information that comes into existence after the requirement is made). The requirement may be of a standing nature. (CSRC Act section 16C(1), CSA Act section 150D(1))
• use the information to identify a person and decide if that person can apply for a child support assessment, make or amend a child support assessment and decide whether a terminating event has happened (CSA Act section 150D(2)), and
• use the information to identify a person, so as to register and collect child support payments (CSRC Act section 16C(2)).

One of the objects of the TFN system is to facilitate the administration of the child support legislation (Income Tax Assessment Act section 202(ga)). The ATO can disclose protected information about taxpayers to Services Australia where the information is necessary for the administration of the child support legislation (Taxation Administration Act section 355-65).


## Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015(TFN Rule)


The Privacy Commissioner, in the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), issued the TFN Rule made under section 17 of the Privacy Act, which regulates the collection, storage, use, disclosure, security and disposal of individuals' TFN information. The TFN Rule is legally binding, and a breach of the rule is an interference with individual privacy under the Privacy Act. Individuals who consider their TFN information has been mishandled may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner. Where a breach of privacy is very serious, the Information Commissioner may seek to impose a civil penalty.


As well as constituting a breach of the TFN Rule, unauthorised use or disclosure of TFNs may constitute an offence under the Taxation Administration Act, with a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units (11.6.7) or 2 years imprisonment, or both (Taxation Administration Act section 8WA).


Services Australia is an authorised recipient of TFN information for the purposes of child support legislation.


The TFN Rule recognises that Services Australia uses TFNs for child support purposes and explains some of Services Australia's obligations when collecting and using them.


More detailed information about privacy is available on theOAIC website, and theServices Australia website.


TFN queries or enquiries can be directed to Services Australia through theirContact uspage.

# 11.5.2 Address for service of notices


## Context


A notice must be addressed correctly in order to be properly served.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 62, section 63CSRC Regssection 34, section 35CSA Regssection 20


## Address for service


The most recent address provided to the Registrar is that person's address for service (CSRC Regs section 34 and CSA Regs section 20).


If an address has not be provided to the Registrar for service, but the Registrar's records contain an address attributed to that person, the last address in any record held by the Registrar is the person’s address for service.


If a person’s address changes and they fail to provide the new address to the Registrar for service, they cannot plead the change of address as a defence in any proceedings under the CSRC Act and CSRC Regs (CSRC Regs section 35).


## Addressing a notice to a partnership


A notice may be issued to any member of a partnership.


Example:A notice to a partner in a partnership can be addressed in either of the following ways:

• Mr James A BrownPartner in Brown and SmithTrading as ABC Printingat address for service of notices
• Messrs Brown and Smith in Partnershipat address for service of notices

In the 2 examples above, references to the partnership in the body of the notice would specify 'ABC Printing' and 'Messrs Brown and Smith' respectively.


## Addressing a notice to a company or trust estate


Under the IncomeTax Assessment Act 1936, a company or trust must have a 'public officer' and an address for service of that public officer. The public officer and address for service for taxation purposes are also the public officer and address for service for the CSRC Act (CSRC Act section 62, section 63).


As the company is the 'person' liable to comply with the notice, the company is required to be served with the notice, not one of its employees (for example, a director).


The trustee of the trust estate is the 'person' liable to comply with the notice.


Service on the public officer at the address for service is sufficient service on the company or trustee for the purposes of the CSRC Act. Proceedings against the public officer are deemed to be proceedings against the company or trustee.


A notice forwarded to a Commonwealth, state or territorial department should be addressed to the 'Paying Officer' at the postal address of the department.


Notices to attend court and give evidence (11.1.7) can only apply to a natural person. Notices can be addressed to a company director or other officer of the company rather than a company itself.

WORD COUNT: 824
================================================================================


The Guides to Social Policy Law is a collection of publications designed to assist decision makers administering social policy law. The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 11.4.4 Collection & use of third party information


## Context


Child support (1.1.C.60) obligations primarily relate to the parents (1.1.P.10) of the children. Generally, the Registrar does not need to collect and use information in relation to third parties such as a parent's new partner (1.1.P.20). However, there are some situations where the Registrar may collect and use third party information.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 98B, section 98C, section 98K


## Other children taken into account in the child support assessment


A parent may have other relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60) in their care (1.1.C.10). This information is relevant to a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and can affect the amount of child support payable.


## Financial relationships with other people


Sometimes a parent's financial affairs may be closely related to, or 'intertwined' with, the financial affairs of other people. A parent may be involved in a formal financial structure such as a business. Parents may also share assets or money with other people, such as a joint bank account, or place their assets or money in the names of other people or entities. This can be relevant when the Registrar needs to look more closely at a parent's financial affairs.


## Change of assessment (1.1.C.50)


If the child support assessment does not accurately reflect a parent's income or capacity to pay child support, a parent can apply for a change of assessment, or the Registrar can initiate a change of assessment. The Registrar may then need to look more closely at the parent's financial affairs including financial arrangements involving other people and decide on the fairest way to treat such arrangements for child support purposes.


A person can apply for a change of assessment because of the responsibility of the person to maintain a resident child or step child (5.2.11). The person will need to supply information to verify that such a duty exists and show how it affects their capacity to pay child support.


The person applying for the change of assessment may need to supply financial information about their partner as the parent of the resident child or step child, to evidence their partner's capacity to contribute to the support of the child.


Example:A parent applies for a change of assessment because they have a duty to maintain their disabled spouse. The Registrar may require that parent to provide medical evidence to verify their spouse cannot support themselves, and details of the spouse's expenses.


In deciding whether to change an assessment, the Registrar must also consider if any change is fair and equitable and, in doing so, must again look more closely at both parents' financial position. The Registrar may scrutinise financial arrangements with other people, especially if a parent shares income, expenditure, debts or assets with another person. This could involve examining household expenses.


## Collection & enforcement


If a parent owes child support, and the Registrar is taking action to enforce payment, the Registrar may need to make detailed enquiries into the parent's financial affairs. If a parent has financial arrangements involving another person, the Registrar may need to collect and use information about those arrangements.


Example:Alyssa owes significant arrears of child support, and the Registrar is intending to take the matter to court. Alyssa advises that they have no assets because their assets are in their new partner's name. The Registrar may make enquiries about assets in the partner's name and, in seeking to have orders made regarding the assets, use that information to ask questions in court.


## Statements from third parties


The Registrar can consider statements provided by third parties. The Registrar will advise the third party and the parent who provided the statement that the other parent will be told the source of the information and given details of the information contained in the statement so that they can comment on the information. If the third party or parent providing the information does not want the details provided to the other parent, the Registrar will not consider the statement when making a decision.


The Registrar will respect the privacy of the parents, and the children involved. The Registrar will generally not obtain, nor have regard to, information from children (11.2.2). The Registrar will generally not contact third parties without the consent of the parent who provided the information and will not imply that any person is obliged to provide information to the Registrar. If a parent provides a written statement from a third party, the Registrar will infer that they have consented to the third party being contacted.

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 11.4.6 Authorised representatives


## Context


Parents (1.1.P.10) and carers in the Child Support Scheme may specifically authorise a third person to make enquiries on their behalf.


## Act references


## On this page


Services Australia will communicate with a representative who has been authorised to act on behalf of a child support (1.1.C.60) parent or carer and is able to provide sufficient information to identify themselves. This may involve Services Australia disclosing protected information to the representative, including information about the other party in the child support case (1.1.C.80) that would otherwise be disclosed to the person who provided the authorisation (see 'Disclosure to the other parent' in11.4.3). This is permitted under the secrecy provisions because the disclosure is for the purposes of the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(2A) and CSA Act section 150(2A)).


Services Australia will also communicate with a person's representative who is legally entitled to act on their behalf.


Services Australia is not obliged to recognise the authority of a nominated representative, but generally will. If Services Australia considers that an authorised representative is not acting in the best interests of the person they are representing, or is otherwise concerned about their actions, Services Australia will refuse to deal with the representative. The person who provided the authorisation will be requested to make more suitable communication arrangements.


While not an exhaustive list, Services Australia may consider refusing to accept as a representative a person or organisation:

• who routinely broadcasts information in the public domain, for example, media personalities
• whose behaviour is threatening towards the other parent or to Services Australia, or
• who attempts to undermine the integrity of The Child Support Scheme.

Services Australia will not accept a person as a representative if they are under the age of 18. Services Australia will strongly advise against a parent having either a child over the age of 18 years or the other parent in their case as a representative. However, if they insist, Services Australia may agree to treat the person as a representative.

• Types of authorised representatives
• Authorisation
• Extent of a person's authority to act - ordinary authority
• Extent of a person's authority to act - power of attorney or legal authority
• Interpreters & telephone assistance services

## Types of authorised representatives


Services Australia can communicate with 2 types of authorised representatives:

• authorised agents with power of attorney, or other legal authority to act on a person's behalf, and
• representatives with ordinary authority, including solicitors.

Possession of a power of attorney is sufficient authorisation if it confers on the recipient authority to do anything that he or she can lawfully do on behalf of a person as an attorney.


The representative must provide a written document to Services Australia conferring a general power of attorney to act on behalf of a person, or a power of attorney to act on behalf of a person for child support purposes. Services Australia will accept as a representative someone who is able to provide this documentation.


An administrator or financial manager may be appointed (by a court or a tribunal) if a person has a condition rendering them incapable of making decisions. An administrator or financial manager may be given full or limited powers, and the extent of the power will be fully set out in the relevant order.


Where such an order covers child support matters of a parent, the decision of the administrator or the financial manager is taken to be the decision of the parent. In these cases, Services Australia will be dealing with the appointee only and not the parent.


Representatives with ordinary authority have been authorised by a person to act on their behalf. They could be the solicitor of the child support parent, their partner (1.1.P.20), friend, or any third party authorised by the parent to act on their behalf, including Members of Parliament and their electorate staff making representations on behalf of their constituent. An authorised representative does not need to be an individual but can be an organisation or a position within an organisation. For example, a parent who is in prison may authorise the prison social worker to be their representative. It should be noted that the Commonwealth Ombudsman does not act as a representative. The Ombudsman is authorised by legislation to investigate the administrative actions of Commonwealth agencies (11.4.3) including Services Australia.


## Authorisation


Services Australia must be satisfied that a representative has authorisation from a person to represent them in child support matters. For example, tax agents can act on behalf of a parent in relation to their taxation affairs, but would not generally represent their clients in child support matters.


A representative can be authorised by the parent to act on their behalf with Services Australia by:

• providing verbal authority specifying if this is for a one-off telephone conversation, or for ongoing representative authority
• completing aChild Support Representative Authority Form, or
• providing the relevant information in a letter of authorisation or other document. They must specify that an individual or organisation is a person’s child support representative.

The best proof that a representative has of their authority is for the representative to produce a letter of authorisation from the parent. A letter of authorisation would preferably:

• identify the parent and the representative
• be signed and dated by the parent and the representative
• specify the extent to which the representative represents the parent
• specify the period for which it is valid, and
• contain sufficient information to identify the representative (over the telephone or in person).

A Child Support Representative Authority form is available, permitting a representative to enquire or act on the parent's behalf when dealing with Services Australia.


The authorisation must be current. If no period is specified, Services Australia will decide whether it is current based on its wording and the circumstances, such as the nature of the relationship between the representative and the parent. Consideration will be given to whether the parent might reasonably expect Services Australia to give the representative particular information, depending on the nature of the enquiry and the nature of their relationship. For example, the name of the parent's employer or the parent's address would be particularly sensitive and irrelevant to satisfying any inquiry.


In some circumstances, the parent may not be able to sign an authority (for example, if the parent has a physical or mental incapacity that means they are unable to deal with their own affairs), but the representative must still be able to satisfy Services Australia that they are responsible for the parent's affairs. A medical certificate or a statutory declaration signed by the representative may be appropriate.


Services Australia will accept that a Member of Parliament (or a member of their electorate staff) is authorised to act on behalf of their constituent if they can produce written authorisation. If they have no written authorisation, Services Australia will assume an authorisation exists if they can:

• satisfactorily prove their identity and position
• identify the constituent who has made the complaint, and
• quote information that Services Australia knows could only have come from their constituent.

## Extent of a person's authority to act - ordinary authority


Services Australia will accept that a representative with ordinary authority can act for a person in matters that are limited to certain enquiries and actions. This generally involves providing or seeking information, lodging forms and making enquiries.


A representative with ordinary authority can perform actions including, but not limited to the following:

• provide or seek information regarding a change in percentage of care (1.1.P.70)
• provide information in relation to an objection (1.1.O.10)
• make enquiries regarding pending or missed payments
• make enquiries regarding penalties, the debt amount or recovery action
• provide information concerning relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60)
• request account statements, notices of assessment or decision letters, and
• provide new contact information for the parent (if the parent has specified that the representative may do so).

A representative with ordinary authority can lodge forms signed by the person whom they represent, including for:

• objections
• change of assessment (1.1.C.50) applications, and
• child support agreements.

A representative with ordinary authority can also enter into payment arrangements (limited to situations where Services Australia has not commenced and does not intend to commence enforcement action).


A representative with ordinary authority cannot make applications or elections under child support legislation on behalf of the parent.


A representative with ordinary authority cannot represent the parent in a change of assessment process. This includes where the change of assessment application is being reconsidered following an objection. However, in limited circumstances, a person with legal authority may represent a parent in a change of assessment process (see below and5.6.1for further information).


## Extent of a person's authority to act - power of attorney or legal authority


Services Australia will accept that a person with a power of attorney or other legal authority can act for a person in more complex matters (in addition to being able to perform actions that a representative with ordinary authority can perform). These complex matters relate to processes which may alter the child support liability and obligations, or matters where a representative could make an application or election provided for under child support legislation on behalf of a payer (1.1.P.40) or payee (1.1.P.30). They include, but are not limited to:

• elections to end or resume collection
• an application for a child support assessment
• an application that theFAR(1.1.F.10) not apply
• an application to reduce a minimum assessment
• an application for non-agency payments to be credited
• debt negotiations when Services Australia is contemplating enforcement actions (for example, litigation, making aDPO(1.1.D.50))
• elections that employer withholding (1.1.E.20) not apply, and
• income estimate (1.1.I.20) elections.

In limited circumstances, a person with power of attorney or legal authority may also apply for a change of assessment in the name of the parent or represent the parent during the change of assessment process.


## Interpreters & telephone assistance services


Services Australia may use interpreters and telephone assistance services to help communicate with parents and carers in the Child Support Scheme. Such services do not involve representation, but enable Services Australia to better communicate with parents and carers. Services Australia must be satisfied that any interpreter or translator is only relaying the conversation between Services Australia and the person, and not interposing their own views or altering the information.


Where the National Relay Service (NRS) or Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS) is used, translation only will occur. Where, for example, a parent wants a relative or friend to act as their translator, and it is clear that more than mere translation is occurring, Services Australia will treat that person as a representative and require specific authorisation from the parent.


The NRS is a service that allows people who are deaf, or have a speech, hearing or other communication impairment, to communicate with other people over the telephone. The NRS is bound by confidentiality and privacy principles.


A Services Australia staff member contacted by a parent using the NRS should initially note the name of the NRS operator and time of the call. The staff member should then proceed to establish proof of identity of the caller in the usual manner. Similarly, where a staff member needs to contact a parent who uses NRS, Services Australia will call the NRS, and ask for the call to be relayed to the parent. Proof of identity procedures should then be followed once the parent has accepted the communication mode.


The TIS is another service that Services Australia and parents use to help communicate. Providing the parent has given the staff member consent to use the TIS to communicate and can satisfy the proof of identity requirements, Services Australia will deal with the parent through the TIS as though dealing with the parent directly.

The secrecy provisions of the child support legislation apply to all people occupying positions where they may obtain protected information about a person in the course of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation. These are:

• the Child Support Registrar
• the Minister for Government Services
• the Minister for Social Services
• the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia
• the Secretary of DSS
• Services Australia employees
• DSS employees
• the Commissioner of Taxation
• a person employed or appointed by, or providing services to, the Commonwealth
• the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or an officer of that department who has received information in relation to overseas maintenance orders or the enforcement of child support overseas
• any person if the information concerns a credible threat to the life, health or welfare of a person
• a person with a 'sufficient interest'
• a payee (1.1.P.30) of a registered maintenance liability or carer liability (1.1.C.30) who has notified Services Australia in accordance with CSRC Act section 113A of their intention to institute private payee enforcement proceedings
• members of theART(1.1.A.40), and
• officers of the Court.

The secrecy provisions continue to apply to a person after they cease performing those duties.


## Offence to record or communicate protected information unless exceptions apply


It is an offence under the secrecy provisions for a person to make a record of any protected information. It is also an offence for a person to communicate protected information about a person to someone other than that person (CSRC Act section 16(2), CSA Actsection 150(2)).


The exception is where the person records or communicates the information for the purposes of the child support legislation, or where they are required to do so as part of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(2A), CSA Actsection 150(2A)).


This means that Services Australia can make a record of personal information where that information is needed to administer a person's child support case (1.1.C.80). Services Australia staff can access and use this personal information when they need it to carry out their duties, but not for other purposes. Services Australia can disclose protected information about a person to the person, their authorised representative, or to a person authorised by law. When an officer discloses information, they must ensure they only pass information to a person entitled to receive it.


Another offence under the secrecy provisions applies to the unauthorised use of information by persons other than those listed above. For example, this offence would apply where personal information from Services Australia is sent incorrectly to a person (for example, a letter is sent to the wrong person) and that person then records, communicates or otherwise uses that information (CSA Act section 150AA and CSRC Act section 16AA). This offence does not apply if the personal information was obtained legally from a source other than the records of Services Australia or a relevant department.


The penalty for breaching the secrecy provisions of the child support legislation is imprisonment for one year. See11.6for more information on the secrecy offences.


## When protected information can be disclosed to another person


Certain provisions in the child support legislation require the Registrar to provide protected information about an individual to a person other than that individual. It is not an offence to disclose protected information where the disclosure is required or authorised by law.


## Disclosure by consent


The Registrar is authorised to communicate protected information to a person who has the consent of the person (to whom the information relates) to obtain that information (CSA Act section 150(3)(f) and CSRC Actsection 16(3)(f)).


## Disclosure to the other parent


Assessment notices (1.1.A.120): Services Australia discloses some personal information about one parent (1.1.P.10) to the other parent in child support assessment notices. This information can include the parent's name and income, the number and age ranges of any dependent children the parent has, and the number and age ranges of any other children the parent is assessed to pay child support (1.1.C.60) for (CSA Act section 76). The purpose of this disclosure is to provide the other parent with enough information to understand how the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is calculated and, if they think the assessment is unfair or incorrect, to exercise their rights to challenge the assessment. This disclosure is required by law and is therefore also permitted under thePrivacy Act 1988.


Information about debt recovery action: The Registrar is also authorised to take such steps as the Registrar considers appropriate to inform a payee of action taken to recover their child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt (CSRC Act section 113(2)). This means Services Australia may disclose some personal information about the payer (1.1.P.40) to the payee. Services Australia will not disclose personal information that is not directly relevant or necessary to keep the payee informed (for example, Services Australia will not disclose the name of the payer's employer, that they are unemployed, or the name of their bank).


Services Australia advises Basmat (the payee) that litigation action is being taken and a judgment against the property of Eppie (the payer) is being sought. Services Australia does not advise Basmat of the details of Eppie's property.


Services Australia advises Leonard (the payee) that a warrant of execution has been issued against Anastasia (the payer) which was returned because the court was unable to find any assets to seize.


Services Australia advises Arthur (the payee) that Deborah's (the payer) tax refund has been intercepted.


Services Australia advises Erica (the payee) that employer withholding to collect child support from Bernard (the payer) is being arranged. Services Australia does not tell Erica the name of Bernard's employer, or the date that Bernard started work.


Services Australia advises Cornelia (the payee) that aDPOhas been issued to prevent Fernando (the payer) from leaving the country. Services Australia does not tell Cornelia where Fernando was intending to travel to, or the dates of the travel.


Services Australia advises Jaxson (the payee) that a DPO has not been issued despite receiving information from Jaxson that Neha (the payer) was intending to travel. Services Australia does not disclose to Jaxson the specific reasons for this decision.


Information for private payee enforcement proceedings: Necessary information may be released by Services Australia to a requesting payee (CSA Act section 150(4G) and CSRC Act section 16(4G)) where they have notified the Registrar of their intention to institute court proceedings to recover a child support debt or a carer debt in accordance with CSRC Act section 113A. However, any information released by Services Australia would be for those proceedings only and the person receiving the information would become subject to the secrecy provisions in their handling of the information.


Change of assessment (1.1.C.50): When a parent applies for a change of assessment, the Registrar must send a copy of the application form (including detailed financial information and any accompanying documentation) to the other parent (CSA Act section 98G(1)). The Registrar will then seek a response from the other parent and send a copy of the response to the applicant, along with any accompanying documents (CSA Actsection 98G(3)).


Objections (1.1.O.10): When a parent has objected to a decision, the Registrar is required to send the objection and accompanying documents to the other parent (CSRC Act section 85). The Registrar will seek a response from the other parent. In order to make a decision in a way that is procedurally fair, Services Australia will necessarily discuss a parent's personal information with the other parent. The purpose of this disclosure is to provide the other parent with enough information to be able to comment on any information that is being considered by the Registrar and to allow them to be able to exercise their rights to challenge the decision. This disclosure is necessary in order to make a decision under the child support legislation. As it is for the purposes of the child support legislation, the disclosure is permitted by the secrecy provisions.


ART review: SeeDisclosure to the ARTbelow.


## Disclosure to a person other than the other parent


The Registrar may obtain information and collect relevant debts from third parties such as employers, banks, accountants, trustees in bankruptcy and lawyers. In order to do this, Services Australia may disclose some personal information about parents to third parties. The information that Services Australia may disclose could include identity details such as name, address or date of birth, the amount of child support payable, and the amount of unpaid child support.


Example:The Registrar sends a notice to Martina's employer which includes personal information about Martina. The notice includes Martina's name, address, date of birth and specifies the amount of child support to be deducted from Martina's wages.


## Disclosure to an authorised representative


Services Australia can communicate with a person who has been authorised to receive information on behalf of a parent or carer. This may involve Services Australia disclosing protected information to the authorised representative, including information about the other party in the child support case that would otherwise bedisclosed to the parent or carer. More information about dealing with authorised representatives is also available in11.4.6.


## Disclosure to specified government agencies & office holders


Protected information can be communicated by the Registrar, or officers with appropriate authority, to specified government agencies and office holders in certain circumstances.


DSS: Protected information can be communicated to the Social Services Secretary or an officer or an employee of DSS for the purposes of administering the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(3)(a) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(a)).


Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia and Chief Executive Centrelink: Protected information can be communicated to these officers and to other authorised officers or employees where this is for the purposes of administering the child support legislation or Commonwealth laws for pensions, benefits or allowances (CSRC Act section 16(3)(ba) and CSA Act section 150(3)(ba)). The information able to be disclosed includes details of the amount of child support a parent is entitled to be paid and the amount of child support that has been paid to the payee. This allows for assessment and adjustment of parents' benefits accordingly. Services Australia can also pass on information that could help to identify fraudulent pension claims and respond to specific requests for information from Centrelink.


Chief Executive Medicare: Protected information can be communicated to the Chief Executive Medicare and to other authorised officers or employees, where this is for the purpose of the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under theHuman Services (Medicare) Act 1973(CSRC Act section 16(3)(bb) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(bb)).


Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA): Services Australia can communicate protected information to the Secretary of DVA or an officer or employee of DVA, where this is for the purposes of administering Commonwealth laws for pensions, benefits or allowances (CSRC Act section 16(3)(b) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(b)).


ATO: Services Australia can communicate protected information to a person performing duties under or in relation to legislation administered by the Commissioner of Taxation to allow them to perform those duties (CSRC Act section 16(3)(ca) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(ca)).


Services Australia exchanges personal information such as names andTFNs with the ATO. This exchange enables Services Australia to determine when new taxable income (1.1.T.20) information is available for parents. The exchange also allows Services Australia to identify when a person has both a tax refund amount due and a relevant debt owing (8.3.1), as the Registrar may require the ATO to pay the amount to be applied to the relevant debt.


Attorney-General's Department: Services Australia can communicate protected information to the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or an officer or employee of that department, for the purposes of enforcing overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40) (CSRC Act section 16(3)(d) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(d)).


## Disclosure to contractors & others providing services to the Commonwealth


Services Australia can communicate protected information to a person performing duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation to allow them to perform those duties (CSRC Act section 16(3)(c) and CSA Actsection 150(3)(c)).


## Disclosure to any person to prevent credible threat


Services Australia can communicate protected information to any person if the information concerns a credible threat to the life, health, or welfare of a person and:

• Services Australia believes on reasonable grounds that the communication is necessary to prevent or lessen the threat, or
• there is reason to suspect that the threat may afford evidence that an offence may be, or has been, committed against a person and the information is communicated for the purpose of preventing, investigating or prosecuting such an offence.

See CSRC Act section 16(3)(e), CSA Act section 150(3)(e), and1.4.1for information about family violence.


## Disclosure to a court


It is not an offence under the child support legislation for Services Australia to communicate protected information to a court because a court is not a person. However, Services Australia is not required to communicate protected information to a court except for the purposes of either of the child support Acts (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Actsection 150(5)).


The exception is where a court has ordered the Registrar to provide information about a child's location (FL Act section 67J). These orders are referred to as Commonwealth information orders or location orders. They are mandatory and a person must comply with them in spite of any other law (FL Act section 67M(6) and section 67N(10)). The secrecy provisions in the child support legislation also make it clear that the Registrar must comply with Commonwealth information orders or location orders (CSRC Act section 16(9) and CSA Actsection 150(9)).


See11.1.7for information about subpoenas.


## Disclosure to the ART


The ART, like the court, has the authority to require the production of documents or the answering of questions (ARTAct section 74 and section 79, CSRC Act section 16(1) and CSA Actsection 150(1)).


### Review of a decision of the Registrar


When a parent applies to the ART for review of a decision, the Registrar is required to send the ART and the parties to the review a statement about the decision and copies of any documents that are relevant to the review of the decision (ARTAct section 23 and CSRC Act section 95C). The parties will generally be both parents, the Registrar and any other person who has been made a party to the review. The ART may also ask the Registrar to provide or obtain additional information for the purposes of the review (ARTAct section 79, CSRC Act section 95J).


See10.3for further information about ART review of decisions.


In some situations the ART may direct a person not to disclose the information in the statement or document or may limit its use for particular purposes. The ART can also direct the Registrar not to disclose a statement or document (which has been disclosed for the purposes of that ART review) or can direct that its disclosure be restricted (ARTAct section 70, section 71 and CSRC Act section 98B, section 98C).


### Review of family assistance or social security decisions


The Registrar is not required to communicate protected information to the ART when it is reviewing a care determination made by the Secretary unless it is for the purposes of either of the child support Acts (CSRC Act section 16(5) and CSA Actsection 150(5)).


The ART may request information from the Registrar when it is reviewing a care (1.1.C.10) determination made by the Secretary. The Registrar will provide the information to the ART as the percentage of care (1.1.P.70) will ultimately impact on the child support assessment.


The ART may request information from the Registrar when it is reviewing a non-child support related matter, for example where the ART is reviewing a decision relating to social security pensions, benefits or allowances. If Services Australia is representing the Secretary as a participating party to the proceeding, the ART may require Services Australia to provide information held by the Registrar. Alternatively, the ART has the power to issue a summons for such information (ARTAct section 74). Whilst the Registrar is not required to comply with a request, and may seek to be excused from a summons, this information will be provided because it is consistent with the Registrar's ability to release the same information to the Chief Executive Centrelink under CSRC Act section 16(3)(ba) and CSA Act section 150(3)(ba).


Example:The ART is reviewing a determination made by the Secretary rejecting a person's claim forFTB. The person concerned has a child support assessment in place and the ART is satisfied that the Registrar may have information that is relevant to the decision under review. If the ART requests information from the Registrar, that request will be complied with if the information is in the Registrar's possession.


## Disclosure to Commonwealth investigating & auditing agencies

• Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman
• Privacy Commissioner
• Auditor-General or officers of the Australian National Audit Office
• Department of Finance

These Commonwealth agencies are authorised by Parliament to investigate or audit the departmental processes and to make specific decisions for which they are responsible, and require the provision of information or documents. Services Australia can provide protected information to officers of these agencies because it is in the course of their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation (CSRC Act section 16(2A) and CSA Actsection 150(2A)).


## Disclosure to the Minister


Protected information can be used to brief a Minister for various purposes in relation to their responsibilities. A 'Minister' means the Minister for Social Services, who administers child support legislation, the Minister for Government Services, who has responsibility for Services Australia as the service delivery agency, and the Prime Minister (CSA Act section 150(4C) and CSRC Actsection 16(4C)).


Specifically, protected information may be communicated to a Minister in the following circumstances:

• so that the Minister can respond to complaints or issues raised with the Minister
• in respect of a meeting or forum that the Minister is to attend
• in relation to issues raised or proposed to be raised publicly (by or on behalf of the person to whom the information relates) so that the Minister can respond by correcting a mistake of fact, a misleading perception or impression, a misleading statement or an incorrectly held opinion
• where it involves a possible error or delay on the part of the Registrar or an officer or employee of Services Australia, or
• where it involves an instance of an anomalous or unusual operation of the child support legislation.

## Disclosure to persons with a 'sufficient interest'


In certain circumstances (listed under the subheadings below) disclosures may be made to a person with a 'sufficient interest' in the protected information. The Registrar or a person authorised by the Registrar must be satisfied that, in relation to the purposes of the communication, the person has a genuine and legitimate interest in the information (CSA Act sections 150(4) and 150(4A) and CSRC Act sections 16(4) and 16(4A)). A Minister administering the child support legislation, a Minister responsible for the delivery of services under the legislation, or the Prime Minister, would have sufficient interest.


A further requirement which must be met (before information could be released in the circumstances outlined below) is that the information in question could not reasonably be obtained from a source other than Services Australia or DSS (CSA Act section 150(4)(a) and CSRC Actsection 16(4)(a)).


### Mistake of fact & integrity of the administration of the legislation


Protected information is able to be communicated to correct a mistake of fact about the administration of the child support legislation, if the integrity of that administration would be at risk if the mistake were not corrected. See CSA Act section 150(4B) and CSRC Actsection 16(4B).


### Missing persons


Services Australia is able to communicate protected information where the information is about a missing person and there is no reasonable ground to believe the missing person would not want the information communicated and it is necessary:

• to assist a court, coronial enquiry, Royal Commission, department or authority, of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, in relation to the whereabouts of the missing person, or
• to locate a person (including the missing person).

See CSA Act section 150(4D) and CSRC Act section 16(4D).


### Deceased persons


Services Australia can communicate protected information where the information is about a deceased person and there is no reasonable ground to believe that the deceased person would not have wanted the information communicated and:

• it is necessary to assist a court, coronial enquiry, Royal Commission, department or authority, of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, in relation to the death of a person
• it is necessary to help a person locate a relative or beneficiary of the deceased person, or
• it is in relation to the administration of the estate of the deceased person.

See CSA Act section 150(4E) and CSRC Act 16(4E).


Services Australia may also communicate protected information if the information is to establish:

• the death of a person, or
• the place where the death of a person is registered.

See CSA Act section 150(4F) and CSRC Act section 16(4F).


## Disclosure to overseas authorities


Services Australia can give protected information to an overseas authority if:

• a request from an overseas authority for information is received
• the request is made in reliance on an international maintenance arrangement, and
• it is necessary or convenient for the purposes of the international maintenance arrangement to give the information to the overseas authority.

See CSRC Act section 121B.


Example:New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support (NZIRCS) requests information from the Registrar about the income of a payer who is resident in Australia for the purpose of making a child support assessment in New Zealand. This request is made in reliance on the Australia and New Zealand Agreement (1.5.2). It is necessary for the purposes of this agreement for the Registrar to provide the information. Services Australia can disclose this information to NZIRCS.

# 11.5.3 Proof of service


## Context


The Registrar may need to provide proof of service of a notice.


## Description


There are 2 ways in which effective service of a notice can be proved:

• by ensuring the notice has come to the attention of the person being served, or
• by deemed receipt through service by post or delivery.

If a notice is personally served, an affidavit should be prepared. The affidavit should detail the date, time, place and persons involved. It should also record any conversation between the server and the recipient of the notice.


If postal service is used, a record should be made concerning addressing, prepaying and posting the letter. These details can be included in an affidavit if required.


If a notice is served by facsimile, the arrangement made with the recipient concerning service should be recorded. A record of the transmission of the facsimile should also be retained.

# 11.5.4 Service & evidence


## Context


The CSRC Act and regulations contain provisions to assist with the production of evidence in court and with the service of documents. The Registrar's powers are also delegated to senior officers (11.1.2).


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 115, section 116, section 118


CSRC Regssection 28, section 30


## On this page

• Substituted service
• Evidence
• Judicial notice of signature

## Substituted service


Where a document is required to be served on a person in relation to enforcement proceedings under the CSRC Act and the Registrar is satisfied, after making reasonable enquiries, that the person:

• is absent from Australia and does not have a lawyer or agent representing them in Australia, or
• cannot be found

the document can be served by posting it, or a sealed copy of it, in a letter to the person's last known address.


There is no need to seek the court's permission for this method of service (CSRC Act section 115).


This provision overrides requirements contained in other legislation, for example, the requirements in the FL Act, relevant rules or regulations, which require the court to make orders for substituted service.


## Evidence


A document signed by the Registrar or Registrar's delegate which claims to be a copy of an entry in the Child Support Register in relation to a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) is prima facie evidence (CSRC Act section 116) that:

• the liability is a registrable maintenance liability
• the liability is registered under the CSRC Act
• the particulars of the entry in the Register are those set out in the document
• all of those particulars are correct

though not in an objection (1.1.O.10), application for review or appeal about the registration of the liability, the particulars in the Register, or particulars in the Register that have been varied.


The Registrar or delegate's certificate saying that an amount is payable on a specified day by a person to the Commonwealth for a specified registrable maintenance liability or specified carer liability (1.1.C.30) is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the certificate (CSRC Act section 116(2) and CSRC Regs section 28).


The Registrar or delegate's certificate saying that an amount is payable on a specified day by a person to the Commonwealth in relation to a deduction from salary or wages is prima facie evidence of the matters stated in the certificate (CSRC Act section 116(2)).


'Prima facie' evidence is evidence of fact which the court must take as proof until there is evidence to disprove it.


Example:A certificate stating how much child support (1.1.C.60) is owing could be disproved by further evidence in court proceedings.


## Judicial notice of signature


A court, tribunal, judge, or person acting judicially, will take judicial notice of the signature of a person who holds the office of Registrar or Registrar's delegate (CSRC Act section 118). 'Judicial notice' means that a court must take notice of things which are clearly established and formal evidence on the issue is not necessary. This means a court or tribunal will not require any further evidence that the signature is the signature of the Registrar or Registrar's delegate.


A document bearing the written, printed or stamped name of the Registrar or Registrar's delegate (including a facsimile of the signature) is taken to have been duly signed by that person unless it is proven to the contrary (CSRC Regs section 30).

# 11.6.1 Employer offences


## Context


The CSRC Act imposes specific duties (7.4.3.20) on employers of payers (1.1.P.40). The legislation contains offence provisions for breach of those duties.


The Registrar may impose penalties (7.4.3.20) on employers for breaching certain duties or take action in court to prosecute (11.6.7) employers. The penalties the court can impose are discussed in this page.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 46, section 47, section 57, section 58, section 59, section 60, section 61, section 121


## On this page

• Failure to make deductions from salary/wages
• Failure to pay deducted amounts to the Registrar
• Failure to notify the Registrar of deductions
• Failure to notify the Registrar that no deductions were made
• Failure to notify the employee of deductions made or that no deductions were made
• Failure to notify the Registrar of employee ceasing employment
• Employer not to prejudice employee or potential employee
• Employer not to disclose information
• Records to be kept & preserved
• Incorrectly keeping records
• Failure to assist an officer authorised to access premises & records

## Failure to make deductions from salary/wages


An employer who fails to make deductions from salary or wages paid to an employee as required by a notice given by the Registrar commits an offence (CSRC Act section 46(4A)). The maximum penalty is 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount).


## Failure to pay deducted amounts to the Registrar


Where an employer makes deductions from an employee's salary or wages, the employer must pay the amounts deducted to Services Australia by the seventh day of the following month (CSRC Act section 47(1)(a)). Failure or refusal to pay deducted amounts is an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of 50 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) and/or imprisonment for 12 months (CSRC Act section 47(3A)).


## Failure to notify the Registrar of deductions


Where an employer makes deductions from an employee's salary or wages, the employer must notify the Registrar of the deductions by the seventh day of the following month (CSRC Act section 47(1)(b)). Failure or refusal to notify is an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of 50 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) and/or imprisonment for 12 months (CSRC Act section 47(3A)).


In addition, a court can order that the employer comply (CSRC Act section 121).


If an employer reports the deducted child support (1.1.C.60) withholding amounts to the Commissioner of Taxation under single touch payroll (STP) reporting, they are not required to report to the Registrar (CSRC Act section 47(1B)). If an employer chooses not to, or fails to, report these amounts under STP reporting, their obligation to report to the Registrar will apply.


## Failure to notify the Registrar that no deductions were made


Where an employer made no deductions in a particular month (for example, because no payments were made to the employee or the amount paid to the employee was below the protected earnings level) they must notify the Registrar by the seventh day of the following month (CSRC Act section 47(1A)). Failure or refusal to notify is an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 47(3B)).


If an employer provides the notification to the Commissioner of Taxation under STP reporting, they are not required to notify the Registrar (CSRC Act section 47(1B)). If an employer chooses not to, or fails to, provide notification under STP reporting, their obligation to notify the Registrar will apply.


## Failure to notify the employee of deductions made or that no deductions were made


Where an employer, who has been required by the Registrar to make deductions from an employee's salary or wages, makes a payment to the employee, the employer must notify the employee of the amount deducted or that no amount has been deducted (CSRC Act section 47(2)). Failure or refusal to notify the employee is an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 47(3B)).


## Failure to notify the Registrar of employee ceasing employment


Where an employee's employment ceases, the employer must notify the Registrar by the seventh day of the following month (CSRC Act section 47(3)). Failure or refusal to notify is an offence. The maximum penalty is a fine of 5 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 47(3C)).


## Employer not to prejudice employee or potential employee


An employer must not do any of the following things to an employee or potential employee:

• refuse to employ or pay salary or wages
• dismiss or threaten to dismiss
• terminate or threaten to terminate payment of salary or wages
• prejudice or threaten to prejudice in their employment or in ways other than through receipt of salary or wages
• intimidate or coerce, impose any pecuniary penalty or take any disciplinary action
• is a payer (1.1.P.40) of a liability which can be, or is registered with Services Australia, or
• is a payer of a liability for whom the employer is required to make child support deductions from their salary or wages.

The provision is not limited to parents (1.1.P.10) who are already payers.


It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove the reason for the employer's action. It is a defence if the employer proves, on the balance of probability, that their actions were not motivated (in whole or in part) by one of the specified reasons.


Situations which would warrant investigation include those where an employer:

• threatens to sack employees because of the need to deduct child support
• charges employees an amount to cover the employers' costs of deducting child support
• indicates that, in the future, they will not employ any person who has a child support liability, or
• denies an employee developmental opportunities because of their child support liability.

This offence is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount). In addition, a court can order a convicted person to pay compensation to a person for loss or damage suffered, and/or take other action to reduce the loss or damage suffered by the employee (CSRC Act section 57).


## Employer not to disclose information


Neither an employer nor any person performing duties for an employer can directly or indirectly divulge information about the deduction of child support from a payer's wages. This offence is punishable on conviction by a fine of up to 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 58(1)).


However, an employer who chooses to report information, under STP reporting, to the Commissioner of Taxation about the deduction of child support from a payer's wages, does not commit an offence (CSRC Act section 58(2A)).


## Records to be kept & preserved


Employers are required to keep records that record and explain the amounts deducted, or required to be deducted, from payments to employees (CSRC Act section 59(1)). Employers are also required to record and explain any other acts required by CSRC Act Part IV. Employers must retain the records for 5 years (CSRC Act section 59(1)).


The records must be kept in writing in the English language (or in a form that can readily be converted to writing in the English language). The records must enable the matters and acts referred to above to be readily ascertained (CSRC Act section 59(2)).


The Registrar will notify a person if they are no longer required to keep records. There is no requirement to preserve records of a company that has been liquidated and finally dissolved. Apart from these 2 defences, failure or refusal to keep and preserve records is an offence (CSRC Act sections 59(3) and (4)). The maximum penalty is a fine of 20 penalty units (see11.6.7 for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 59(3)).


## Incorrectly keeping records


Where an employer keeps their records in such a way that they do not correctly record and explain the matters or acts, the employer is guilty of an offence. The offence is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 60(1)).


It is a defence if the employer proves that they did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that the relevant record did not correctly record and explain the matter or act (CSRC Act section 60(2)).


## Failure to assist an officer authorised to access premises & records


The Registrar's powers to enter premises and access documents are discussed in11.2.


It is an offence for the occupier of land or premises entered (or proposed to be entered) by an officer under section 61 to fail to provide all reasonable assistance or facilities that the occupier is capable of providing (CSRC Act section 61(3)). The maximum penalty for this offence is a fine of 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount).


Providing reasonable facilities includes permitting officers to use the employer's photocopier. However, if the employer does not have a photocopier or it is not reasonable for them to give access to it, then officers cannot demand this service.


Reasonable assistance can involve an employer indicating where records are located or providing a general explanation of how records are structured. An employer is not required to provide active assistance by actually searching for the exact location of the records.


Where records are stored on computer, reasonable assistance would involve assisting officers to log on to the computer and access the relevant records. It would not involve searching through the records to locate the specific file to which officers are seeking access.

# 11.6.2 Offences involving a failure to comply with notices


## Context


A person who fails to comply with a notice may be guilty of an offence.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 159B, section 160, section 161, section 162


CSRC Actsection 72A, section 120, section 121


## On this page

• Garnishee notice (CSRC Act section 72A)
• Failure to attend, provide information and produce documents
• Failure to provide required information in relation to an estimate of income (CSA Act section 159B)
• Notice to notify about an event or change in circumstances (CSA Act section 160)
• Notice for information or evidence for assessment purposes (CSA Act section 161)
• Notice for information or evidence for collection purposes (CSRS Act section 120)
• Order to comply with requirement (CSRC Act section 121)

## Garnishee notice (CSRC Act section 72A)


The Registrar can give a notice to a person who owes money to a relevant debtor to pay that money to the Registrar (CSRC Act section 72A(1)). See8.3.2.


A person who refuses, or fails, to comply with a valid notice is guilty of an offence unless they have a reasonable excuse. The maximum penalty is 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 72A(2)).


Examples:Solicitors or land brokers who fail to comply with notices issued against the proceeds of a property sale.


An employer who fails to comply with a notice to deduct from a termination payment.


Contractors who fail to deduct amounts from contract payments made.


In addition to the penalty, a court can order the person to pay the Registrar an amount that is not more than the amount, or sum of the amounts (as the case may be), that the person refused, or failed, to pay (CSRC Act section 72A(8)).


The Registrar views a failure or refusal to comply with a notice under section 72A very seriously.


## Failure to attend, provide information & produce documents


The Registrar can require a person to:

• provide information
• produce documents, and
• attend and answer questions.

The Registrar's information gathering powers under the CSRC Act and the CSA Act are discussed in11.2.


## Failure to provide required information in relation to an estimate of income (CSA Act section 159B)


If a person who has been required to give information to the Registrar in relation to an estimate of income recklessly fails to give the necessary notification, they are guilty of an offence (CSA Act section 159B(1)). The requirement to notify the Registrar arises from a notice under section 160 of the CSA Act (11.2).


A person will be taken to have acted reckless where they act without reasonable care (1.1.C.10) or intentionally disregard the requirement, having regard to:

• their abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes, and
• all the circumstances surrounding the alleged offence.

The maximum penalty is 5 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSA Act section 159B(1)).


## Notice to notify about an event or change in circumstances (CSA Act section 160)


If a person fails to comply with a notice under section 160 of the CSA Act (11.2) and they do not have a reasonable excuse (CSA Act section 160(3B)), they may be guilty of an offence (CSA Act section 160(3)). A person has a reasonable excuse if compliance would tend to incriminate them (CSA Act section 160(4)).


A person only needs to comply with a notice to the extent that they are capable (CSA Act section 160(3A)).


This offence is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a maximum of 6 months (CSA Act section 160(3)).


## Notice for information or evidence for assessment purposes (CSA Act section 161)


If a person fails to comply with a notice under section 161 of the CSA Act (11.2) and they do not have a reasonable excuse (CSA Act section 161(3B)), they may be guilty of an offence (CSA Act section 161(3)). A person has a reasonable excuse if compliance would tend to incriminate them (CSA Act section 161(4)).


Example:A payer, Chantal, is required to attend a department office for an interview to answer questions. Chantal attends the interview but refuses to answer questions concerning assets and income. Chantal specifically refuses to answer questions about income that may have been omitted from an estimate of income form Chantal gave previously.


If prosecuted under section 161(3) of the CSA Act, Chantal may be able to argue successfully that answers to the questions would have been self incriminatory and could provide evidence of offences under section 159 of the CSA Act of false and misleading statements.


A person only needs to comply with a notice to the extent that they are capable (CSA Act section 161(3A)).


This offence is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a maximum of 6 months (CSA Act section 161(3)).


## Notice for information or evidence for collection purposes (CSRC Act section 120)


If a person fails to comply with a notice under section 120 of the CSRC Act (11.2) they may be guilty of an offence (CSRC Act section 120(3)). There is no reasonable excuse defence in section 120 of the CSRC Act.


A person only needs to comply with a notice to the extent that they are capable (CSRC Act section 120(4)).


This offence is punishable on conviction by a maximum fine of 20 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 120(3)).


## Order to comply with requirement (CSRC Act section 121)


A court can also order a person to comply with a requirement under section 120 of the CSRC Act or section 161 of the CSA Act within a specified time. Failure to comply with the order of a court is also an offence.


These offences are punishable on conviction by a maximum fine of 50 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) and/or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months if the order is made under the CSRC Act (CSRC Act section 121(3)), or imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months if the order is made under the CSA Act (CSA Act section 162(3)).

# 11.6.3 Offences involving a failure to comply with a requirement of the legislation


## Context


The CSRC Act requires parents (1.1.P.10) to notify the Registrar about certain events. A parent who fails to notify may be committing an offence.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 23, section 33, section 34, section 111


## Requirement to notify the Registrar about certain events


Failure to comply with the following obligations is an offence under the CSRC Act:

• A payer (1.1.P.40) or payee (1.1.P.30) must notify the Registrar of the creation or variation of a maintenance liability by a court (9.2.1) (section 23, section 33 and section 34).
• A payer of an enforceable maintenance liability must notify the Registrar within 14 days of commencing employment (section 111(1)).
• A payer or payee must notify the Registrar within 14 days of changing their name or address (section 111(2)).

A failure to comply with these obligations is punishable on conviction by a fine of up to 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (section 23(7), section 33(2), section 34(2) and section 111(3)).


If the person gave the Registrar the information as soon as it was reasonably practicable after the event (section 111(4)), or after becoming aware of the event (section 23(8), section 33(3) and section 34(3)), this would be a defence against prosecution under these provisions.

# 11.6.4 False & misleading statements


## Context


Both child support (1.1.C.60) Acts establish offences where a person provides false or misleading information. The offences and the penalties that can be imposed are different under each Act. Because both the child support Acts can apply to a case, the circumstances in which a statement is made are important in determining which offence has been committed.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 159, section 159A


## CSRC Act


If a person makes a statement to a relevant officer that is false or misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSRC Act section 119(1)). If a person omits anything from a statement that makes the statement misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSRC Act section 119(1)).


The person has a defence if they can prove they did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that the statement was false or misleading (CSRC Act section 119(2)).


The officer to whom the statement was made must have been exercising powers under the CSRC Act (CSRC Act section 119(3)).


This offence is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding 20 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSRC Act section 119(1)).


## CSA Act


If a person makes a statement to a relevant officer that the person knows is false or misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSA Act section 159(1)). If a person omits anything from a statement that makes the statement misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSA Act section 159(1)).


The person will be taken to have known that the statement was false or misleading if, considering their abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes, and all the circumstances surrounding the alleged offence, they ought to have reasonably known that the statement was false or misleading (CSA Act section 159(2)).


The officer to whom the statement was made must have been exercising powers under the CSA Act (CSA Act section 159(3)).


This offence is punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding 6 months (CSA Act section 159(1)).


If a person recklessly makes a statement to a relevant officer that is false or misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSA Act section 159A(1)). If a person recklessly omits anything from a statement that makes the statement misleading in a material particular, they commit an offence (CSA Act section 159A(1)).


A person is 'reckless' if, considering the circumstances and their abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes, they have acted without taking reasonable care about the accuracy and completeness of the statement (CSA Act section 159A(2)).


The officer to whom the statement was made must have been exercising powers under the CSA Act (CSA Act section 159A(3)).


The maximum penalty for this offence is 5 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) (CSA Act section 159A(1)).


## Material particular


A 'material particular' must be significant or relevant to the Registrar. The Registrar will consider the effect of the statement and the possible advantage gained by the parent (1.1.P.10).

# 11.6.5 Offences in relation to DPO's


## Context


The Registrar can make an order to prevent a person from leaving Australia. This is known as aDPO(1.1.D.50). An offence is committed if the requirements of such an order are breached.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 72F, section 72U, section 72V, section 72W


## Offence provisions for unauthorised departure from Australia


The powers to make a DPO are discussed in8.3.3.


Where a person leaves Australia for a foreign country:

• knowing, or reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and
• the person's departure is not authorised by aDAC(1.1.D.30) (8.3.3.20) and the person knows the departure is not authorised, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised

they are committing an offence (section 72F). The penalty for this offence is 60 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount), or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.


If an authorised officer believes a person is about to depart from Australia when a DPO is in force and without a DAC, they can require the person to answer questions or produce documents (section 72U(2)(b)).


If a person fails to answer a question or produce a document and they are capable of doing so, they commit an offence. The penalty for this offence is 30 penalty units (section 72U(3)).


A person who provides false or misleading answers to questions can be prosecuted (section 72U(5)). The penalty for this offence is 30 penalty units, or 6 months imprisonment, or both.


A person is required to answer the questions asked or produce the documents requested, even if doing so may incriminate them or expose them to a penalty (section 72V(1)). The answers to the questions or the documents produced are not admissible in evidence against the person except in relation to a prosecution under section 72U(5) (section 72V(2)).


A person whose departure is authorised by a DAC must produce the certificate for inspection on the request of an authorised officer (section 72W(1)). Failure or refusal to produce the certificate upon request is an offence. The penalty for this offence is 5 penalty units (section 72W(2)).

# 11.6.6 Secrecy offences


## Context


Child support (1.1.C.60) legislation contains offence provisions for the breach of the secrecy requirements.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 16, section 16AA


CSA Actsection 150, section 150AA


## On this page

• Offence of disclosure of protected information
• Offence of unauthorised use of relevant information

## Offence of disclosure of protected information


The child support legislation provides secrecy requirements (CSA Act section 150 and CSRC Act section 16). For more information about the secrecy requirements, see11.4.


The secrecy requirements apply to:

• the Child Support Registrar
• the Minister for Government Services
• the Minister for Social Services
• the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia
• the Secretary ofDSS
• Services Australia employees and contracted staff
• DSS employees and contracted staff
• the Commissioner of Taxation
• a person employed or appointed by, or providing services to, the Commonwealth
• the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or an employee of that department who has received information in relation to overseas maintenance orders or the enforcement of child support overseas
• any person if the information concerns a credible threat to the life, health or welfare of a person (11.4.3)
• a person with a 'sufficient interest'
• a payee (1.1.P.30) of a registered maintenance liability or carer liability (1.1.C.30) who has notified Services Australia in accordance with the CSRC Act section 113A, of their intention to institute private payee enforcement proceedings (8.4.6)
• members, employees and contracted staff of theART, and
• officers of a Court.

A person listed above must not (CSA Act section 150(2) and CSRC Act section 16(2)):

• make a record of any protected information (see11.4.3for the definition of protected information), or
• communicate any protected information to a person, either directly or indirectly.

The exception is where the person makes the record or communicates the information (CSA Act section 150(2A) and CSRC Act section 16(2A)):

• under or for the purposes of the child support legislation, or
• in the course of performing their duties under, or in relation to, the child support legislation.

The penalty for breaching the secrecy requirements is imprisonment for one year.


## Offence of unauthorised use of relevant information


A further offence, which deals with unauthorised use of relevant information, applies to any person (who is not a person listed above):

• who makes a record of information, communicates, or otherwise makes use of information, and
• that information is information about a person obtained from the records of DSS, Services Australia, or is information to the effect that there is no information about that person held by DSS or Services Australia.

See the CSA Act section 150AA and the CSRC Act section 16AA.


Example:This offence would apply if personal information was incorrectly sent by Services Australia to a person (for example, a letter mailed to the wrong person) and that person records, communicates or otherwise uses that personal information.


The above offence would not apply if a person were to record, communicate or otherwise use personal information that was obtained legally from a source other than Services Australia or the Registrar.


People who have been given personal information legitimately (for example, payees who have initiated private payee enforcement proceedings under section 113A of the CSRC Act) may use or record that information for the purpose for which it was given, but would be subject to the offence provisions if they were to otherwise use or record it.


The penalty for breaching the secrecy requirements is imprisonment for one year.

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 2.1.2 Eligible child


## Context


The Registrar can only make a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) for a child who is:

• an eligible child (CSA Act section 18), and
• a child for whom an application can be made (CSA Act section 24).

A parent (1.1.P.10), or non-parent carer, may apply for a child support assessment if the child (CSA Act section 24):

• is aneligible child
• is under 18 years of age
• is not a member of a couple (1.1.M.10), and
• meet theresidency requirementsfor a child support assessment (1.6).

## Act references


CSA Actsection 18, section 19, section 20, section 21, section 22, section 24


## Eligible child


An eligible child must:

• be born on or after 1 October 1989 (the commencing day of the CSA Act) (CSA Act section 19)
• have parents who lived together and who separated (1.1.S.30) on or after 1 October 1989 (CSA Act section 20), or
• have a brother or sister who was born to the same parents on or after 1 October 1989 (CSA Act section 21), and
• not be cared for under a child welfare law of Western Australia or South Australia (CSA Act section 22, CSA Regs section 6).

A child welfare law of Western Australia does not include a child welfare law that applies as a law of Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island. A person who is caring for a child in Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island under a child welfare law may have care (1.1.C.10) of an 'eligible child', but the non-parent carer may apply for child support (1.1.C.60) only if the non-parent carer is a relative of the child (see 'child welfare law' in2.1.1).


Note:In some situations, an order may be made pursuant to a child welfare law of Western Australia or South Australia, but the order is not active. Meaning, the child is currently being cared for by a parent who is not receiving any financial support pursuant to the order. In these circumstances the Registrar may consider the child is not under the care of a person under a child welfare law for child support purposes, and may regard the child as an eligible child despite the existence of the order.


## Residency & citizenship requirements - child


If the parent or non-parent carer, who would be eligible to receive child support, is not a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100) or a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.90), the residency requirements for the child apply. For more information see1.6.2.

# 11.6.7 Prosecution of offences


## Context


The Registrar can take action to prosecute people who commit offences under the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation.


Offences under child support legislation are not indictable offences (that is, offences with a maximum penalty of a gaol term of more than 12 months) and are tried summarily by a summons to attend a Magistrate's Court and are heard by a magistrate without a jury.


## Act reference


Crimes Act 1914section 4AA, section 4B, section 15B


## On this page

• Focus for prosecution
• Time limits for prosecution
• Penalties
• Evidence

## Focus for prosecution


Potential offences under child support legislation, or other Commonwealth legislation, may be investigated. The investigation of offences, and the prosecution action taken by the Registrar must reflect there is a limit to the resources available. Therefore, the Registrar will concentrate on the cases that deserve prosecution.


In deciding whether to pursue prosecution the Registrar will consider:

• the seriousness of the alleged offence (not just in dollar terms)
• any other means of enforcement available
• the impact of the alleged offence, and
• whether the alleged offence involves deliberate evasion or obstruction.

A brief of evidence can then be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who is responsible for deciding whether the Commonwealth should take prosecution action.


## Time limits for prosecution


Prosecution of an offence against a Commonwealth law must be commenced (section 15B):

• In the case of an individualif the maximum penalty is a gaol term of more than 6 months in the case of a first conviction, at any time, orin all other cases, a summons must be signed within 12 months of the offence being committed.
• if the maximum penalty is a gaol term of more than 6 months in the case of a first conviction, at any time, or
• in all other cases, a summons must be signed within 12 months of the offence being committed.
• In the case of a body corporateif the maximum penalty is a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction, at any time, orin all other cases, a summons must be signed within 12 months of the offence being committed.
• if the maximum penalty is a fine of more than 150 penalty units in the case of a first conviction, at any time, or
• in all other cases, a summons must be signed within 12 months of the offence being committed.

## Penalties


Section 4AA of the Crimes Act specifies the monetary value of a penalty unit at any particular time.


If the penalty for an offence is a gaol term and there is no monetary penalty imposed (for example, failing to comply with a notice under CSA Act section 161) a court that has convicted a 'natural' person (that is, not a company) can impose a fine instead of or in addition to, imprisonment (section 4B).


Unless specified, a court can impose a fine on a body corporate of up to 5 times greater than the fine that can be imposed on an individual (section 4B).


## Evidence


The evidence presented must convince the magistrate. This means that the offence must be broken down into its elements and each element must be proved for the offence to be established.

# 2.1.3 Parentage


## Context


When a parent (1.1.P.10) or a non-parent carer asks the Registrar to make a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), the Registrar must be satisfied the persons to be assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210) are parents of the child. The Registrar will only be satisfied that a person is a parent in specific situations.

• Conflicting evidence

• Child born as a result of an artificial conception procedure

• Same-sex parents
• Review of decisions to accept or refuse an application on the basis of parentage

## Presumptions of parentage


The Registrar can be satisfied a person is a parent if one or more of the following presumption situations apply (CSA Act section 29(2)).

• The person is or was a party to a marriage and the child was born to the person, or to the other party to the marriage, during the marriage. A child is born during a marriage even if the parties to the marriage have separated (1.1.S.30) as long as a divorce was not finalised at the time of the birth (meaning, the child was born before the decree absolute).
• The person is named as the child's parent in a register of births, or parentage information kept under Australian law or the laws of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (1.5.1). The Registrar will accept a person's verbal or written assurance that they are named as the child's parent in a register of births but the applicant may need to provide a statutory declaration or a copy of the birth certificate to establish that the other parent is named in the register of births.
• An Australian court, or a court of a reciprocating jurisdiction, has expressly found the person is a parent of the child, or has made a finding that could not have been made unless the person was a parent of the child (and that finding has not been set aside, altered or reversed).
• The person has executed an instrument under an Australian law, or the law of a reciprocating jurisdiction, such as a statutory declaration under the Oaths Act of an Australian state or an affidavit, acknowledging they are the child's parent, and the instrument has not been annulled or set aside.
• The person has adopted the child in Australia or under the law of another country (whether or not that country is a reciprocating jurisdiction). The Registrar will accept a verbal or written declaration from a person that they themselves are named as the child's parent in legal adoption papers.
• The person is a man and the child was born within 44 weeks after his marriage to the child's mother was annulled.
• The person is a man who was married to the child's mother and they separated, then resumedcohabitationfor 3 months or less, and the child was born within 44 weeks of the end of that last period of cohabitation but after they divorced (after the date of the decree absolute).
• The person is a man whocohabitedwith the child's mother at any time during the period beginning 44 weeks and ending 20 weeks before the child was born, but they were not married at any time during that period.
• The Registrar is satisfied that the person is a parent of the child under FL Act section 60H or section 60HB.

The Registrar cannot be satisfied that a person is a parent of a child solely on the basis of the results of paternity tests. The Registrar cannot be satisfied that a person is a parent of a child on the basis of a person's verbal acknowledgment of parentage; however a person can provide verbal confirmation that they themselves are named as a parent of a child in a register of births. Only a court may determine that it is satisfied of a child's parentage on the basis of other evidence.


## Conflicting evidence


The Registrar does not need to conduct enquiries or make investigations, although the Registrar may choose to do so to ensure a parentage presumption under CSA Act section 29(2) is met, or to ensure that only one of the parentage presumptions is met. If information is available under more than one of the paragraphs in CSA Act section 29(2) and the evidence conflicts, the Registrar can choose which person is more likely to be a parent of the child (CSA Act section 29(3)), taking into account the evidence in relation to each of the presumptions.


The Registrar does not have to be satisfied a person is a parent even if one of the ninepresumptionsituations exist if there is conflicting information casting doubt on a child's parentage.


The Registrar can consider other types of evidence when making a decision about conflicting evidence.


The Registrar is not making a finding of parentage, but an administrative decision as part of a decision whether or not to accept an application for assessment.


## Cohabitation


For the purposes of CSA Act sections 29(2)(g) and 29(2)(h), cohabitation means 'living together in a sexual relationship' (Bixby and Farraday (SSAT Appeal)(2009) FMCAfam 647). In deciding whether a man and woman cohabited at any time during the relevant period, the Registrar will consider:

• whether the man and woman are living together rather than merely visiting or spending time together, and
• the existence of a sexual relationship between the man and woman.

Each case must be considered on its own merits to determine whether it is likely the person is a parent of the child.


## A child born as a result of an artificial conception procedure


A person who is a parent under FL Act section 60H is also considered a parent for the purposes of the CSA Act.


Section 60H applies to children born as a result of artificial conception procedures. A woman who gives birth to a child, in Australia or overseas, following an artificial conception procedure is legally a parent of the child. If the child was born to a woman whilst married or in a de facto relationship (either same-sex or opposite-sex) and her partner (1.1.P.20) consented to the procedure, the partner is also a parent of the child. A woman's partner is presumed to consent to the procedure unless it is demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that he or she did not consent.


Prior to 1 July 2009 a same-sex partner of a woman who gave birth to a child born as a result of an artificial conception procedure was not a 'parent'.


## A child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement


A person who is a parent under FL Act section 60HB is also considered a parent for the purposes of the CSA Act.


60HB applies to children who are born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement. If a court has made an order under a prescribed law of a state or territory declaring that each of one or more people are parents of a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, then those people are also parents of the child for the purposes of child support (1.1.C.60).


Not all states and territories have prescribed laws under which a court can make an order about parentage of children born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement. The list of prescribed legislation is at section 49 FL Regs.


Prior to 1 July 2009 the commissioning parents of a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement were not recognised as parents for the purposes of child support legislation even if an order had been made under state or territory law.


## Same-sex parents


A same-sex couple will be considered to be the parents of a child for the purposes of the CSA Act if:

• they have adopted the child
• the child was born as a result of anartificial conception procedureand the parents were married or in a de facto relationship at the time of the artificial conception procedure, or
• the child was born as a result of asurrogacy arrangement, and a court has made an order under a prescribed law of a state or territory declaring that the couple are the parents of the child.

In order for an application for a child support assessment to be accepted, the Registrar must be satisfied that one of thepresumptions of parentageexists in relation to the child.


## Review of decisions to accept or refuse an application on the basis of parentage


A parent can object to the acceptance of or refusal to accept a child support application on any ground, other than a ground that the person is, or is not, a parent of the child. See10.2.2for more information about objecting to a child support application decision.


A person assessed in relation to the COTC who believes they are not a parent of the child must apply directly to a court for a declaration under CSA Act section 107 (Bixby and Farraday (SSAT Appeal)(2009) FMCAfam 647). See10.4.2for further information on declarations under CSA Act section 107.


Once the application is accepted, the Registrar cannot cancel an assessment because the payer (1.1.P.40) and payee (1.1.P.30) agree that the payer is not a parent (Child Support Registrar & Z & T(2002) FamCa 182) or there is better evidence. If a payer or payee later advises the Registrar they have more evidence about the parentage of a child they should be advised of their right to apply to a court for a declaration under CSA Act section 107. Alternatively, the payee may be able to elect to end the assessment (5.2).


If the application was refused because the Registrar was not satisfied that the person, who was to be assessed in respect of the COTC, was a parent of the child, the applicant can apply directly to a court for a declaration under CSA Act section 106A (10.4.2). Alternatively, if the applicant is able to produce new information that would satisfy one of the presumptions of parentage in relation to the person to be assessed in respect of the COTC, they can make a new application using the new information. If a new application is made, any resulting assessment will only run from the date of the new application.

# 2.1.1 Applications for assessment


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10), or non-parent carer who is an eligible carer (1.1.E.10), can apply to the Registrar for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support (1.1.C.60) for a child.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, section 7B, section 25, section 25A, section 26, section 26A, section 27, section 28, section 29A, section 29B, section 30, section 150A


CSA Regssection 6, section 9, section 23


## On this page

• How to apply for an assessment
• Applications from parents
• Applications from non-parent carers
• Where parents have more than one child
• Living together
• Joint carers
• Child welfare law
• Special circumstances
• Application for assessment where one parent is not a resident of Australia

## How to apply for an assessment


The Registrar can specify the way in which an application for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) must be made (CSA Act sections 27 and 150A). A person can make an application:

• by telephoning Services Australia
• by completing and lodging forms on Services Australia's website, or
• in writing, by completing forms and lodging by email, mail, or fax.

A payee (1.1.P.30) residing in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) must apply via the central authority in the jurisdiction where the payee resides.


## Applications from parents


A parent can apply for a child support assessment for a child if they are not living with the other parent of the child as their partner (1.1.P.20) on agenuine domestic basis(CSA Actsection 25(b)).Parents can apply for an administrative assessment of child support for a child regardless of the amount of care (1.1.C.10) they provide for their child.


When a parent makes an application for child support, that application means that both they and the other parent will be assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210) (CSA Actsection 25(a)).


As both parents are assessed in respect of the COTC, the roles of payer (1.1.P.40) and payee and the amount of child support payable will depend on the incomes of both parents and the care they each provide for the children (Part 4). If the income and/or care percentage (1.1.C.20) changes, the roles may reverse and the child support assessment will generally continue without the need for a new application for child support.


If either parent is not a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100) on the day the application is made then there are additional considerations, see 'Application for assessment where one parent is not a resident of Australia' below.


## Applications from non-parent carers


A non-parent carer can apply for an administrative assessment of child support for a child (CSA Act section 25A) if they:

• are an eligible carer of the child
• arenot living with either parent as the partner of that parent on a genuine domestic basis, and
• do not havecare jointlywith a parent of the child (CSA Act section 26)
• if they are caring for the child under achild welfare law, they are a relative of the child (CSA Act section 26A, see additional conditions below), and
• apply against both parents, or
• apply against one parent only whenthe other parent is not a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1)the Registrar is satisfied that there arespecial circumstances, orthe other parent is deceased.
• the other parent is not a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1)
• the Registrar is satisfied that there arespecial circumstances, or
• the other parent is deceased.

If either parent is not a resident of Australia on the day the application is made then there are additional considerations. See 'Application for assessment where one parent is not a resident of Australia' below.


Where both parents are assessed in respect of the COTC, there is a single administrative assessment based on the income of both parents and any care that they may have of the child (4.1.7). However, each parent may have a separate liability to the non-parent carer as a result of this assessment, or one parent may have a liability to both the non-parent carer and the other parent.


## Where parents have more than one child


Where parents have more than one child from their relationship, they may apply for an administrative assessment for some or all of the children. An application for more than one child is treated as if it were separate applications for each child (CSA Act section 28).


If parents choose not to apply for an assessment for a child, then that child will not be included when assessing the COTC for the other children. Either parent may apply for an assessment for the child at any time, and an assessment will start from that date, if the relevant requirements are met.


Where there is no assessment for a child, the child may be a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) if other criteria are met.


## Living together


A parent or non-parent carer may not apply for a child support assessment for a child if they are living as the partner of the other parent, on a genuine domestic basis.


The factors to be considered (SS Guide2.2.5.30) in establishing whether people are living together as partners on a genuine domestic basis are:

• financial aspects of the relationship
• nature of the household
• social aspects of the relationship
• presence or absence of a sexual relationship, and
• nature of the commitment.

In addition, a person cannot live with another person as their partner on a 'genuine domestic basis' if they are aged under 16 years. This is because a person is living with another person as their partner on a genuine domestic basis if the relationship has the characteristics of marriage (FO v HAF(2006) QCA 555;Re Kennison and Secretary, Department of Social Security(1985) 8 ALD 560). To have the characteristics of marriage, the persons must be at least 16 years old, which refers to a person's capacity to marry pursuant to theMarriage Act 1961(Cth).


Lastly, if parents, or a parent and non-parent carer, are legally separated (1.1.S.30) but are still residing in the home they shared, they are not considered to be living together as partners on a genuine domestic basis. More than a physical separation within the home is required. It involves one or both parties forming the intention to end the relationship and acting upon that intention (including communication of the intention to the other party).


## Joint carers


If 2 or more people care for the child together in a residence they share (jointly), only one of the joint carers can apply. If one of the joint carers is a parent of a child, they must be the one who applies for a child support assessment (CSA Act section 26).


Example:Irma, a child of Sirin and Jana, is in the joint care of Sirin and Tushar. Sirin can apply for a child support assessment for Irma. Tushar cannot apply for a child support assessment.


## Child welfare law


A child welfare law for child support purposes is the same as a child welfare law for family law purposes (CSA Act section 7, FL Act section 4(1), FL Regs section 5). A child welfare law includes a child welfare law that applies as a law of Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island.


A non-parent carer who is caring for a child under a child welfare law may apply for child support only if they are the child's relative (CSA Act section 26A). A non-parent carer is a relative of a child (FL Act section 4(1)) if they are:

• a step-parent of the child. A step-parent means a person who is not a parent of the child, and is or has been, married to, or a de facto partner of, a parent of the child and treated the child as a member of the family formed with the parent
• a brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, step-brother or step-sister of the child
• a grandparent of the child
• an uncle or aunt of the child
• a nephew or niece of the child
• a cousin of the child, or
• for an Aboriginal child or Torres Strait Islander child – a person who, in accordance with the child’s Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander culture (including but not limited to any kinship systems of that culture), is related to the child.

However, a person who is caring for a child under a child welfare law of Western Australia or South Australia cannot apply for child support because the child is not an eligible child (CSA Act section 22, CSA Regs section 6).


A child welfare law of Western Australia does not include a child welfare law that applies as a law of Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island. A person who is caring for a child in Cocos (Keeling) Island or Christmas Island under a child welfare law may have care of an 'eligible child', but the non-parent carer may apply for child support only if the non-parent carer is a relative of the child.


Refer to2.1.2for information about eligible children.


Example:Ivette has care of a grandchild, Ralphie, under a child welfare law applying in Victoria. Ivette can apply for both parents to be assessed for the costs of the child.


Example:Yousef is the step-grandparent of Esperanza and has care of Esperanza under a child welfare law applying in NSW. Yousef cannot apply for both parents to be assessed for the costs of the child because Yousef is not a relative of Esperanza.


## Special circumstances


A non-parent carer may make an application that only one parent be assessed for the COTC because of the special circumstances of the case. What the Registrar considers to be special circumstances will depend on the particular circumstances of the non-parent carer's case. It is expected that both parents will be assessed for child support whenever possible. The applicant must show the particular circumstances regarding the child are sufficiently special that only one parent should be assessed. Special circumstances may include:

• fear of violence
• harmful or disruptive effect
• the identity of the parent is unknown to both the Registrar and the non-parent carer
• no evidence for the Registrar to be satisfied that a person is a parent
• where a child has only one legal parent as a result of adoption or the provisions relating to artificial conception procedures and surrogacy under sections 60H and 60HB of the FL Act (see2.1.3for more information)
• cultural considerations
• non-parent carer's case commenced before 1 July 2008
• non-parent carer and one parent are overseas and non-parent carer wishes to apply only against the parent in Australia, and
• other special circumstances.

Services Australia may seek evidence of the special circumstances.


## Application for assessment where one parent is not a resident of Australia


Where a payee resides in Australia, either party can apply for an administrative assessment if the payer is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) (other than an excluded jurisdiction listed in section 9 of the CSA Regs) on the day the application is made (CSA Act sections 29A and 30A). If the payer resides in a non-reciprocating jurisdiction or an excluded jurisdiction either party can apply for a court order for child maintenance (1.5.3) under the FL Act.


Where a payee resides outside Australia, either parent can apply for an administrative assessment if the payer resides in Australia and either:

• the payee is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (CSA Act section 24(2)), or
• the child in relation to whom the application is made is present in Australia on the day the application is made, and/or the child is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia on the day the application is made (CSA Act section 24(1)(b)).

### Making an application from overseas


A payee who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) cannot make an application directly to the Registrar (CSA Act section 29B). If the payee resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction an application from the payee must either be:

• made by the payee and given to the overseas authority (1.1.O.30) in the reciprocating jurisdiction to pass on to the Registrar, or
• made by the overseas authority in the reciprocating jurisdiction on behalf of the payee.

A payer who resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction can make an application directly to the Registrar, or give the application to the overseas authority in the reciprocating jurisdiction to pass on to the Registrar (CSA Act section 29B).


A parent or non-parent carer who lives in a non-reciprocating jurisdiction can make an application directly to the Registrar.

# 2.1.5 Deciding to accept or refuse an application


## Context


The Registrar must decide to accept or refuse an application for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


## Act references


CSA Actsection 7B, section 24, section 25, section 25A, section 27, section 29, section 29A, section 29B, section 30, section 30A, section 30B, section 31, section 33


## Description


If the Registrar is satisfied a person has properly made an application for a child support assessment, the application must be accepted (CSA Act section 30(1)). The Registrar may determine an application is not properly made where there is already an overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) registered for the same case and one party is resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.90) (CSA Act section 30B).


If the Registrar is not satisfied an application is properly made (CSA Act section 30(2)) it may be refused. The Registrar can defer making a decision where an applicant requires further time to supply information or evidence.


An application is properly made if it complies with sections 24, 25, 25A and 27 of the CSA Act.

• Section 24 specifies which children an application can be made for (2.1.2).
• Sections 25 and 25A specify who may apply for a child support assessment (2.1.1).
• Section 27 specifies how the application is to be made (2.1.1).

Where one parent (1.1.P.10) resides overseas the application is properly made if:

• the parent who is likely to be required to pay child support (1.1.C.60) is not a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100) on the day the application is made but is resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction which is not an excluded jurisdiction (1.5.1) (CSA Act section 29A(3), section 30A), and the child is present in Australia on the day the application is made, or is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia on that day,(CSA Act section 24(1))
• the application is made by a person who is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) and who is likely to receive child support, the application is made by the person and forwarded to the Registrar by the overseas authority (1.1.O.30) of that reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10), OR the application is made by the overseas authority on behalf of the person (CSA Act section 29B), or
• the parent who is likely to receive child support is not resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) and the child is present in Australia on the day on which the application is made, or is an Australian citizen or ordinarily resident in Australia on that day (CSA Act section 24(1)).

The Registrar is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations when deciding whether an application complies with sections 24, 25, 25A and 27 of the CSA Act. The Registrar can act on the basis of the application and any documents which accompanied it (CSA Act section 29(1)). However, the Registrar is not prevented from seeking further information or evidence.


The Registrar will refuse an application if the residency requirements are not satisfied (CSA Act section 29A) or if the Registrar is not satisfied that a person named in the application as a parent of the child is a parent of the child (CSA Act section 29(2)). See2.1.3for information about when the Registrar may be satisfied a person is a parent.


If an application is refused, the Registrar will notify the parties, explaining why the application was refused (CSA Act section 33). See2.1.6for information about the notice of the decision.


If an application is accepted, a child support assessment and aCSP(1.1.C.150) must start on the day the application was made to Services Australia (CSA Act section 31(1) and CSA Regs section 23).

• the right to object (10.2.2) to the Registrar's decision to accept the application for a child support assessment, and to apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for a review of the objection (1.1.O.10) decision, and
• the parent's right to apply to a court for a declaration under section 107 if they believe they are not a parent of the child (10.4.2).

## Refusing an application


The Registrar must immediately notify the applicant if an application for a child support assessment is refused (CSA Act section 33). The notification must be in writing.


If one of the reasons the application is refused is because the Registrar is not satisfied that a person is a parent of the child, the applicant must be notified of:

• the reasons why their application was refused, and
• their right to apply to a court for a declaration under section 106A (10.4.2).

If the application is refused for any other reason, the applicant must be notified of their right to object (10.2.2) to the Registrar's decision to refuse the application for a child support assessment, and to apply to the ART for a review of the objection decision (10.3).

# 2.2 The formulas


## Introduction


The Registrar will use an administrative formula to calculate the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable under an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30), unless the assessment is varied by:

• a departure order by a court (2.5.5)
• a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision (5.5), or
• the provisions of a child support agreement (6.3).

The annual rate of child support payable is calculated using one of 6 formulas (section 35B). The 6 formulas are variations of one basic formula (1.1.B.10) and exist to recognise the different circumstances of families.


Parents (1.1.P.10) can use the online Child Support Estimator to estimate the amount of child support payable under a formula assessment (1.1.F.20) for a single child support case (1.1.C.80).

# 2.2.1 The steps involved in making a child support assessment


## Description


When working out the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable for a child using Formula 1 (2.2.2), the basic formula (1.1.B.10), the Registrar must use the following steps:


If a parent has a positive child support percentage under Step 6, the 'annual rate of child support' payable by the parent for the child for the day is worked out using the formula:

• Child support percentage ×COTC

There are additional steps required when one of the other 5 formulas is used.

# 2.2.2 Formula 1 - the basic formula - a single case assessment


## Context


The basic formula (1.1.B.10), Formula 1, is used to calculate the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable when only the parents (1.1.P.10) have care (1.1.C.10) of the child/ren and neither parent has another child support case (1.1.C.80).


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, Part 5, section 35, section 41, section 42, section 48, section 55B, section 55C, section 55D, section 55G, section 55H, section 67A.


## The 8 Steps of the basic formula


The Registrar must follow the 8 steps of the basic formula (CSA Act section 35) in making an assessment when neither parent has another child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and only the parents provide care (1.1.C.10) for the children. This is referred to as a single case assessment.


The formula adopts an 'income shares' approach, which includes calculating the costs of raising children. These costs depend upon the income of the parents and the number and the age of the children. The costs are then shared between parents based on each parent's share of their combined child support income (1.1.C.190). The first step of the formula is to identify each parent's child support income (1.1.C.120).


If a parent has a positive child support percentage under Step 6, the 'annual rate of child support' payable by the parent for the child for the day is worked out using the formula:

• Child support percentage × COTC

### Example – Using 2025 rates


Mark and Lisette have 3 children, Domitilla aged 9, Delia aged 7, and Helen aged 5, who spend 290 nights a year with Mark. The children spend 75 nights a year with Lisette, who has regular care (1.1.R.50) of the children. Mark has anATI(1.1.A.20) of $50,000 and Lisette has an ATI of $60,000.


3 children aged 0 to 12 years = $13,531

• Total cost is $13,531 =$12,086 + (($50,318 - $44,762) × 26%)
• The cost of each child is $4,510

Step 8 – Calculate child support payable for each child


Lisette has a positive child support percentage so only she will pay child support.


Note:A percentage of care (1.1.P.70) is calculated for each child. As the care arrangements for these children are the same, the percentage is the same for all the children. If there are different care arrangements for different children, then they may have different percentages of care and potentially different cost percentages.


If there is an annual rate payable by each parent (because they each care for a child), the rates are offset against each other to arrive at a single, overall rate of child support payable by one parent to the other (CSA Act section 67A).

# 2.2.3 Formula 2 - single case with a non-parent carer


## Context


Formula 2 is used when a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) includes a non-parent carer who is providing some care (1.1.C.10) for a child and neither parent has another child support case (1.1.C.80).


A non-parent carer has no legal responsibility for the child; therefore, their income is not used in the calculation of the assessment. However, the care provided by the non-parent carer/s for a child is included in the calculations.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 25A, section 36, section 40A, section 40B


## On this page

• Formula 2 methodology
• When child support is payable by or to more than one person
• When 2 non-parent carers are entitled to receive child support

## Formula 2 methodology


When working out the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable for a child using Formula 2, the Registrar must use the following steps.


Steps 1 to 7 are the same as for the basic formula (Formula 1), with additional calculations at Step 4 and Step 5 where a percentage of care and a cost percentage (1.1.C.200) are also worked out for the non-parent carer/s. Additional calculations may also be required at Step 8.


The annual rate of child support payable by the parent for the child is worked out using the formula:

• Child support percentage × COTC

Child support may be payable by one or both of the parents, depending on their child support percentage and care level


## When child support is payable by or to more than one person


If both parents have a positive child support percentage at Step 6 for a child, then both parents pay child support to the non-parent carer/s (section 36(4)).


The first parent, Augustin, has a child support percentage of 83.47%. The second parent, Zora, has a child support percentage of 16.53%. The costs of the child are $1,000.


Both parents are required to pay child support to Maura (a non-parent carer) who has full-time care of the child.Augustin will pay $1,000 × 83.47% = $835.Zora will pay $1,000 × 16.53% = $165.


If one parent, the first parent, has a positive child support percentage at Step 6, and the other parent has a negative child support percentage and less than shared care (1.1.S.40), then the first parent pays child support to the non-parent carer/s (section 36(4)).


The first parent, Surya, has a child support percentage of 83.47%. The second parent, Euclid, has regular care of the child and a child support percentage of −7.47% (16.53% − 24%). The costs of the child are $1,000.


The first parent Surya is required to pay child support to Sandra (a non-parent carer) who has primary care of the child. Surya will pay $1,000 × 83.47% = $835.


If one parent, the first parent, has a positive child support percentage at Step 6 and the other parent has a negative child support percentage and at least shared care, then the first parent pays child support to the second parent and the non-parent carer (section 36(5)). The first parent will pay to the second parent an amount of child support calculated using the second parent's negative child support percentage as a positive. The balance of the child support amount payable by the first parent is paid to the non-parent carer.


The first parent, Randolph, has a child support percentage of 83.47%. The second parent, Tori, has 37% care of the child (shared care), and a child support percentage of −12.47% (16.53% − 29%). The costs of the child are $1,000.


The first parent Randolph is required to pay child support to Tori, using Tori's negative child support percentage as a positive. Randolph will pay $1,000 × 12.47% = $125.The first parent Randolph is required to pay Calum (a non-parent carer) the balance of the child support they must pay as he has shared care of the child. Randolph will pay Calum $835 − $125 = $710.


## When 2 non-parent carers are entitled to receive child support


If 2 non-parent carers are entitled to receive child support for a child, then the amount to be paid by the parent/s is shared in accordance with each carer's share of cost percentages of all people entitled to receive child support (section 40A). If only one child of the relationship is in the relevant shared care arrangement, then only the child support for that child is shared between the carers.


Adrianna and Kevin have one child Tullia. Martin (a non-parent carer) has a care percentage of 45%. Tatjana has a care percentage of 40% and Kevin has a care percentage of 15%.Martin has a cost percentage of 45%. Tatjana has a cost percentage of 35% and Kevin has a cost percentage of 24%.The parents (Adrianna and Kevin) both have an income percentage of 50%.The costs of the child are $1,000.


Adrianna is required to pay $500 ($1,000 × (50% − 0%)).Kevin is required to pay $260 ($1,000 × (50% − 24%)).A total of $760 is payable.


The cost percentages of Martin (45%) and Tatjana (35%) total 80%.Kevin is not entitled to receive child support as they have less than 35% care.


Martin is entitled to receive $760 × (45% ÷ 80%) = $428.Tatjana is entitled to receive $760 × (35% ÷ 80%) = $333.

# 2.2.4 Formula 3 - multiple child support cases


## Context


Formula 3 is used to work out the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable for a child when one or both of the parents (1.1.P.10) have at least one other case, and there is no non-parent carer.


## Formula 3 methodology


Follow steps 1 to 6 of Formula 1 – the basic formula (1.1.B.10)

• Step 1 - Work out each parent's child support income (1.1.C.120)Where a parent has more than one child support case (1.1.C.80), their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) and multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) may differ across their child support cases.

Step 1 - Work out each parent's child support income (1.1.C.120)


Where a parent has more than one child support case (1.1.C.80), their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) and multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) may differ across their child support cases.

• Step 2 - Work out the parents' combined child support income (1.1.C.190)
• Step 3 – Work out each parent’s income percentage (1.1.I.30)
• Step 4 – Work out each parent’s percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for the child
• Step 5 - Work out each parent’s cost percentage (1.1.C.200) for the child
• Step 6 – Work out each parent’s child support percentage (1.1.C.140) for the child

Work out theCOTC(1.1.C.210) for the day, calculating the costs for older and younger children separately (section 55HA). This is the same approach to calculating multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50) but uses combined child support income (1.1.C.190).

• Identify the costs for the child for thatCSP(1.1.C.150), based on the combined child support income of the parents
• Identify the number of children in the child support case
• Identify the ages of the child support children
• In respect of each child support child:Assume that all the child support children are of the same age as that child, andIdentify the item in the relevant column in the COTC Table that covers the number of child support children of that age
• Assume that all the child support children are of the same age as that child, and
• Identify the item in the relevant column in the COTC Table that covers the number of child support children of that age

The COTC are the costs identified in the COTC Table divided by the number of child support children


If a parent has a positive child support percentage for a child, the annual rate of child support payable is the lower of:

• Step 1B child support payable
• Step 2 multi-case cap for the child (if any)

## Example - Using 2024 rates


In case 1, Vincent (ATI of $50,000) and Faith (ATI of $35,000) have 2 children, Geraldine aged 14 and Thomas aged 10. In case 2, Vincent has one child, Honoria, aged 5. Vincent has regular care (1.1.R.50) of all the children, providing care for 75 nights a year. Neither parent has any relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60). Faith does not have any other child support cases.


Step 1 – calculate child support income


Child support income = $21,537 ($50,000 − $28,463)

• ($21,537 × 32% = $6,892)
• $6,892 ÷ 3

Child support income = $21,537 ($50,000 − $28,463)

• ($21,537 × 27% = $5,815)
• $5,815 ÷ 3

Child support income = $21,537 ($50,000 − $28,463)

• ($21,537 × 27% = $5,815)
• $5,815 ÷ 3
• $50,000, less
• $28,463, less
• $1,938
• $35,000, less
• $28,463

Step 2 and 3 of Formula 1 – combined child support income and income percentage


Step 4 and 5 of Formula 1 – percentage of care and cost percentage


Step 6 – child support percentage of Formula 1


Step 1A - work out COTC for the day under section 55HACalculate the child costs for each child.

• Combined child support income = $26,136
• Costs based on combined child support income = $7,579
• Costs for the child = $3,790 ($7,579 ÷ 2 children in case)
• Combined child support income = $26,136
• Costs based on combined child support income = $12,853
• Costs for the child = $3,136 ($6,273 ÷ 2 children in case)

Step 1B - work out how much child support is payable for each child


Step 2 - work out the multi-case cap (multi-case costs − (100% − cost percentage))


Step 3 - calculate child support payable

# 2.2.5 Formula 4 - multiple child support cases with a non-parent carer


## Context


Formula 4 is used to work out the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable for a child when one or both of the parents (1.1.P.10) have at least one other case, and one or more non-parent carers has at least 35% care (1.1.C.10) of a child.


## Formula 4 methodology


Follow Steps 1 to 6 of Formula 1 – the basic formula (1.1.B.10)

• Step 1 - Work out each parent's child support income (1.1.C.120)Where a parent has more than one child support case (1.1.C.80), their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) and multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) may differ across their child support cases.

Step 1 - Work out each parent's child support income (1.1.C.120)


Where a parent has more than one child support case (1.1.C.80), their child support income needs to be calculated separately for each case, as the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) and multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) may differ across their child support cases.

• Step 2 - Work out the parents' combined child support income (1.1.C.190)
• Step 3 – Work out each parent’s income percentage (1.1.I.30)
• Step 4 – Work out each parent’s percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for the child
• Step 5 - Work out each parent’s cost percentage (1.1.C.200) for the child
• Step 6 – Work out each parent’s child support percentage (1.1.C.140) for the child

Work out theCOTC(1.1.C.210) for the day, calculating the costs for older and younger children separately (section 55HA). This is the same approach to calculating multi-case costs (1.1.M.50) but uses combined child support income (1.1.C.190).

• Identify the costs for the child for thatCSP(1.1.C.150), based on the combined child support income of the parents
• Identify the number of children in the child support case
• Identify the ages of the child support children
• In respect of each child support child:Assume that all the child support children are of the same age as that child, andIdentify the item in the relevant column in the COTC Table that covers the number of child support children of that age
• Assume that all the child support children are of the same age as that child, and
• Identify the item in the relevant column in the COTC Table that covers the number of child support children of that age

The COTC are the costs identified in the COTC Table divided by the number of child support children


If the parent has a positive child support percentage from Step 1, work out the following rate

• Parent’s child support percentage for the child for the day × COTC for the day

If the parent’s (the first parent’s) child support percentage is positive under Step 6 of Formula 1 (Step 1 of this method), the rate of child support payable by the first parent for the child is the lower of:

• Step 2B child support payable,
• Step 2 multi-case cap for the child (if any)
• The second parent’s child support percentage is also positive, or
• The second parent’s child support percentage is nil or negative, and the second parent does not have at least shared care (1.1.S.40) of the child,

then subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child to the non-parent carer/s child support in accordance with section 40A which is

• the second parent’s child support percentage is negative, and
• the second parent has at least shared care of the child during the relevant care period,

then, subject to section 40B, the first parent must pay the annual rate of child support that is payable by the first parent for the child under Step 4 (subsection 38(4)) to the second parent and the non-parent carer as follows


## Example: Using 2025 rates


In case 1, Aliya (ATI of $45,000) and Edmund (ATI of $70,000) have 2 children, Kristina aged 14 and Harriette aged 10. In case 2, Aliya has shared care of Claudia, aged 7. Aliya also has another child Louisa, aged 4, with her new partner.


Edmund has sole (100%) care of Kristina but Harriette lives full time with a grandparent Ali. Ali has made an application under section 25A for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


Case 1 (with non-parent carer)


Step 1 – calculate child support income


Child support income = $12,582 ($45,000 − $29,841 − $2,577)COTC = $1,342

• ($12,582 × 32% = $4,026)
• $4,026 ÷ 3

Child support income = $12,582 ($45,000 − $29,841 − $2,577)COTC = $1,132

• ($12,582 × 27% = $3,397)
• $3,397 ÷ 3

Child support income = $40,159 ($70,000 − $29,841)COTC = $4,819

• ($40,159 × 24% = $9,638.16)
• $9,638 ÷ 2

Child support income = $12,582 ($45,000 − $29,841 − $2,577)COTC = $1,132

• ($12,582 × 27% = $3,397)
• $3,397 ÷ 3
• $45,000, less
• $29,841, less
• $2,577, less
• $1,132
• $70,000, less
• $29,841463

Step 2 and 3 of Formula 1 – combined child support income and income percentage


Step 4 and 5 of Formula 1 – percentage of care and cost percentage


Step 6 of Formula 1 – child support percentage


Step 1A - work out COTC for the day under section 55HA

• Combined child support income = $51,609
• Costs based on combined child support income = $14,898
• Costs for the child = $7,449 ($14,898 ÷ 2 children in case)
• Combined child support income = $51,609
• Costs based on combined child support income = $12,317
• Costs for the child = $6,158 ($12,317 ÷ 2 children in case)

Step 1B - work out how much child support is payable for each child


Step 2 - work out the multi-case cap (multi-case costs − (100% − cost percentage))


Step 3 - calculate child support payable


$1,342 (multi-case cap is less than child support $1,652)


$1,132 (multi-case cap is less than child support $1,365)


$4,791 (child support is less than multi-case cap $4,819)


Aliya is assessed to pay $1,342 to Edmund for Kristina and $1,132 to Ali for Harriette.


Edmund is assessed to pay $4,819 to Ali for Harriette.


Different rules apply if theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support is payable to more than one person. See2.3.4for details of the rules that apply, which depend upon the level of care provided by the carer.

# 2.2.7 Formula 6 - assessments using the income of only one parent


## Context


Where a non-parent carer applies for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), and one parent (1.1.P.10) is deceased, only one parent's income will be used to calculate child support (1.1.C.60).


## Act reference


CSA Actsection 40, section 41, section 49, section 55C


## Formula 6 methodology


The use of only one parent's income means that not all of the steps of the basic formula (1.1.B.10) are required, and that some different calculations are made.


Work out theCOTCusing the income from Step 1, by using either:

• Formula 1 (2.2.2), or
• Formula 4 (2.2.5) - if the parent has more than one child support case.

Work out the following rate:

• COTC − (parent's cost percentage × COTC)

If there are 2 non-parent carers who each have a percentage of care for the child, and they have both applied for child support, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support payable to the child to the non-parent carers as follows:

• Total amount which non-parent carers are entitled to be paid × (non-parent carer's cost percentage for the child ÷ total of non-parent carers' cost percentages for the child).

# 2.3.2 Current formula values


## Context


This section contains values used inCSPs (1.1.C.150) for the relevant years.


For historical values see topic2.3.3.


The currentCOTC(1.1.C.210) Table is provided at2.3.1.20.


## Act reference


CSA Actsection 5, section 5A, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7


CSRC Actsection 4, section 37


## On this page

• Basic values used in child support assessments
• AWE used for ATI indexation factor
• Child support inflation factor
• CPI values

## Basic values used in child support assessments (1.1.C.70)


## AWEused forATIindexation factor


Information about how the ATI indexation factor is calculated is provided at1.1.A.130.


## Child support inflation factor (1.1.C.130)


## CPIvalues


Court orders and court registered agreements or child support agreements often contain clauses providing for an annual adjustment of the amount payable in accordance with changes in the CPI.


If a court order or court registered agreement provides for a review of the amount payable on a specified date, the arrival of that date is an affecting event (CSRC Act section 4(1)).


An order or child support agreement with a CPI clause will generally state the date on which the comparison is to be made and the particular figures to be used (for example, the weighted average of CPI figures in all capital cities or a specific capital city). Where an order simply refers to CPI, but not a specific measure of it, the Registrar will use the weighted average of CPI in all capital cities from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. TheABSpublishes these figures.


For historical CPI values please see2.3.3.


### CPI figures


The relevant CPI figures for the most recent year are provided below (ABS Consumer Price Index, December Quarter 2024).


Where a court order or agreement includes a clause providing for an annual adjustment of the amount payable in accordance with changes in CPI, the ABS data will be used to calculate the new amount payable. The table above should be used for any adjustments that are required to use September 2012 CPI indexation figures onwards.


The formula used to apply the CPI inflation factor and calculate the new amount payable is:

• Latest quarter index ÷ Earliest quarter index × previous entitlement

Example:A court order provides for the periodic amount (1.1.P.80) of $100 per week to be inflated by the March Sydney CPI, to take effect from 1 July each year.


March 2024 quarter CPI for Sydney - 137.7


March 2025 quarter CPI for Sydney - 140.9

• 140.9 ÷ 137.7 × $100 = $102.32

The new periodic amount payable under the court order will be $102.32 per week starting from 1 January 2025.


### CPI re-reference


In September 2012, the ABS re-referenced the CPI figures, setting the index base to 100.0 for the reference period 2011-12. The ABS also published conversion factors to allow the figures using the new index reference period to be converted to figures that are consistent with figures published before the re-referencing.


The conversion factors are:

# 2.2.6 Formula 5 - assessments using the income of only one parent


## Context


Formula 5 is used where a non-parent carer applies for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), and only one parent's (1.1.P.10) income will be used to calculate child support (1.1.C.60) because the other parent:

• is a resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1)
• is not being assessed because of special circumstances.

Formula 5 uses the income of only one parent, but recognises that the child has 2 parents by doubling the income of the parent to calculate theCOTC(1.1.C.210). The costs are then halved to identify the amount to be paid by the assessed parent.


## Act reference


CSA Actsection 39, section 41, section 49, section 55C


## On this page

• When is Formula 5 used?
• Formula 5 methodology

## When is Formula 5 used?


### One parent is a resident of a non-reciprocating jurisdiction


Formula 5 is used when a non-parent carer has applied for child support to be assessed and one of the parents is neither a resident of Australia (1.6.1) (1.1.R.100) nor a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) (1.1.R.90). Where the residence status of the parents has been considered, and this residency decision has been made and the application has been accepted (2.1.5) a non-resident parent cannot be assessed for child support. This means that the income of that parent is not part of the calculation of the assessment.


### Special circumstances


Formula 5 may be used when a non-parent carer has applied for child support to be assessed on the basis that special circumstances (2.1.1) exist that make it inappropriate for a parent to be assessed for child support. In making a decision on the application, the Registrar will consider the facts to determine if special circumstances do exist. If the Registrar does accept the application, then Formula 5 is used to calculate the liability of the other parent.


## Formula 5 methodology


The use of only one parent's income means that not all of the steps of the basic formula are required, and that some different calculations are made.


Work out the COTC using the income from Step 1, by using either:

• Formula 1 (2.2.2), or
• Formula 4 if the parent has more than one child support case (2.2.5).

Work out the following rate:

• ½ × [COTC − (parent's cost percentage × COTC)]

If there are 2 non-parent carers who each have a percentage of care for the child, and they have both applied for child support, the parent must pay the annual rate of child support payable for the child to the non-parent carers as follows:

• Total amount which non-parent carers are entitled to be paid × (Non-parent carer's cost percentage for the child ÷ Total of non-parent carers' cost percentages for the child).

# 2.3.1.10 About the COTC Table


## Context


The amount of child support (1.1.C.60) payable is calculated by the child support formulas (1.1.C.110) by reference to theCOTC(1.1.C.210) Table, which determines how much of the ordinary COTC each parent (1.1.P.10) is required to meet. Information about the steps involved in making a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) can be found at2.2.1.


The COTC Table is used in the child support formulas (2.2) to calculate:

• 2 components of child support income (1.1.C.120)relevant dependent child amount (3.1.2) (1.1.R.60)multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50) which is used to calculate the multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30), and
• relevant dependent child amount (3.1.2) (1.1.R.60)
• multi-case child costs (1.1.M.50) which is used to calculate the multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30), and
• the COTC for the children for whom the child support application has been made.

The current COTC Table (3 years) can be found at2.3.1.20, and historical tables are available at2.3.1.30.


## On this page

• Using the COTC Table to calculate child costs
• Ages of the children
• Number of children
• Income columns

## Using the COTC Table to calculate child costs


The method used to work out the COTC using the COTC Table is:


Determine if there are 1, 2, 3 or more children and identify the correct row.


If there is 4 or more children, identify the 3 oldest children.


There are 4 children aged 17, 15, 10 and 8.


The 3 oldest children are aged 17, 15 and 10.


The amount calculated is rounded, to the nearest whole dollar (below 50c rounded down, 50c and above rounded up) at each step. This does not apply when calculating the rate of child support payable for a day.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 55F Simplified outline, section 55G Working out the costs of the children, section 55H Working out the costs of the child, section 156 Rounding of amounts, section 5 Interpretation—definitions, Schedule 1 The Costs of the Children Table


## Ages of the children


The COTC Table is divided into:

• all children are aged 0 to 12 years
• all children are aged 13+ years, and
• children are of mixed age (the child support case (1.1.C.80) has children aged 0 to 12 years, and 13+ years).

The COTC for a day in aCSP(1.1.C.150) are calculated based on the age of the children on that day (CSA Act section 55G(4)). If a child turns 13 within the CSP the COTC will be calculated differently for the periods before and after the child's 13th birthday.


Example:Sam and Maria have 3 children, Alex aged 12, Nicholas aged 9 and Michael aged 8. The CSP starts on 6 September 2020. Alex's 13th birthday is on 12 November 2020.


The COTC are calculated using the COTC Table for 3 younger children (0 to 12 years) for the period 6 September to 11 November 2020. For the period 12 November 2020 to 5 December 2021 the costs are calculated using the mixed age amounts in the COTC Table.


Act reference:CSA ActPart 5 Division 6—The costs of the child


## Number of children


The COTC Table is used in every step of the child support formula. The COTC Table determines the costs for up to 3 children. However, at each step where there are 4 or more children, the costs are calculated as for a 3-child family. When calculating costs for more than 3 children, the ages of the oldest 3 children are used (CSA Act section 55G(4)).


When there is more than one child in an assessment, the costs of each child is the total COTC divided by the number of children. This includes when there are children of mixed age, or where there are 4 or more children in the case.


Example:Ivan and Peta have 4 children, Adam aged 16, Deborah aged 15, Bristol aged 13 and Peta aged 8. The COTC are calculated using the ages of the 3 eldest children. As the 3 eldest children are aged 13 and over, the 'children aged 13+ years' section in the COTC Table is used. The costs of each child will be the total COTC divided by the actual number of children, which is 4.


Act reference:CSA ActPart 5 Division 6—The costs of the child


## Income columns


The COTC Table is divided into columns of income which are 0.5 increments of annualisedMTAWE(1.1.A.50). The income used to calculate the COTC may either be:

• combined child support income – for the COTC in Formulas 1, 2, 3 and 4 (2.2)
• one parent's child support incomerelevant dependent child amountmulti-case costsCOTC using Formulas 5 and 6.
• relevant dependent child amount
• multi-case costs
• COTC using Formulas 5 and 6.

Example:The parents' combined child support income is $210,000, for a CSP starting 6 April 2023. There are 2 children aged 13 and over. The COTC are capped at $47,451, the number in the last column of the '2 children' row in the table for older children (13+ years).


The COTC Table caps the COTC when income (combined child support income or child support income) is greater than 2.5 times MTAWE.

# 2.3.4 Minimum annual rate


## Context


TheMAR(1.1.M.20) is a defined rate that is payable for up to 3 cases. The MAR exists to reinforce the principle that all parents (1.1.P.10) must contribute to the financial support of their children.


A parent may apply to have a MAR assessment reduced to nil if their income is less than the amount of the minimum assessment multiplied by the total number of the parent's child support cases (1.1.C.80).


See2.3.2for the current MAR amount and2.3.3for historical amounts.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 65A, section 66, section 66A, section 66B, section 66C, section 116, section 153A, section 155


## On this page

• What is the MAR?
• MAR - parent has more than 3 cases
• Paying the MAR for a case to more than one person
• When can a minimum assessment be reduced to nil?
• Amending an assessment if the reasons to reduce the MAR to nil are no longer satisfied

## What is the MAR?


The MAR may be payable when:

• a parent's annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable is based on the child support formula (1.1.C.110) and is less than the MAR
• the parent has below regular care (1.1.B.20) for all the children in the assessment, and
• the FAR (2.3.5) (1.1.F.10) does not apply.

The maximum liability of a parent under this provision is capped at 3 times the MAR (section 66(6)).


The Registrar will not make a minimum annual assessment where the assessment is made in accordance with a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision, a court order or a child support agreement (section 66(8)).


Note:A change of assessment decision, a court order or a child support agreement can set the annual rate of child support to an amount equivalent to the MAR.


The MAR will apply until either:

• the end of theCSP(1.1.C.150) (section 66(4)(b)(i))
• 28 days after the last day on which the person would otherwise have been assessed to pay less than the minimum rate, even if that day is after the end of the CSP (section 66(4)(b)(ii)), or
• the day before a rate is determined in accordance with a change of assessment decision, order or agreement (section 66(8)).

Example:Anjali has been assessed to pay child support at the MAR in the CSP 1 September 2017 to 30 November 2018.


Anjali's income does not change during this time. She continues to be assessed to pay child support at the MAR until 30 November 2018. A new CSP begins on 1 December 2018, and she will be re-assessed for the new CSP.


Example:Aaron has been assessed to pay child support for the CSP 1 March 2023 to 30 June 2024. On 1 September 2018, Aaron lodges an income estimate (1.1.I.20) of $0 and he is assessed to pay child support at the MAR from this date.


On 10 June 2024, Aaron starts work and updates his income estimate to $40,000. Based on this income, child support would be calculated at a rate higher than the MAR. Aaron is still assessed to pay the MAR until 8 July 2024, which is 28 days after the minimum rate would otherwise cease to be payable even though that day is after the end of the CSP.


Example:Nhung has been assessed to pay child support at the MAR in the CSP 1 August 2023 to 31 October 2024.


A court order sets a higher annual rate to be payable from 1 March 2017. The MAR will cease to be payable from 28 February 2017, the day before the higher rate is payable.


## MAR - parent has more than 3 cases


If a parent is assessed for child support for more than 3 cases, the total amount payable is capped at 3 times the MAR and shared between all the cases using the formula below, regardless of whether the parent is liable to pay child support in all cases (section 66(6)).

• Annual rate for each case = (3 × MAR) ÷ Total number of the parent's child support cases

The total number of cases includes all cases where the parent has been assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210). This includes cases where the liability has been determined in another way, such as in accordance with the provisions of an order or agreement.


Example:As at 7 May 2025, Eric has been assessed in respect of the costs of children in 4 cases. Eric receives an income support payment and has child support income (3.1) (1.1.C.120) of $0.

• Assessment 1: Eric is assessed to pay child support to Srishti for one child. The assessment is varied by a court order which sets an annual rate of $260.
• Assessment 2: Eric is assessed in respect of the costs of 3 children. Eric and Thiva share the care of one child and have sole care of one child each.
• Assessment 3: Eric is assessed to receive child support from Alice for one child.
• Assessment 4: Eric is assessed to pay child support to Yixiao for 2 children.

The amount payable for each case where the MAR is applicable is (3 × MAR ($534)) ÷ 4 = $400.50.


Therefore, Eric is required to pay the following amounts:

• Assessment 1: $260 as required by the court order
• Assessment 2: Nil as Eric has more than regular care of a child
• Assessment 3: Nil as Eric is entitled to receive child support
• Assessment 4: $400.50 as a minimum rate assessment.

## Paying the MAR for a case to more than one person


If the care (1.1.C.10) of the children in a case is divided between a parent carer and one or more non-parent carers, or between 2 or more non-parent carers, then the MAR is shared between the carers as follows (section 66(7)):


Example:Sonicka and Praful have one child William, who lives one week with Praful and the alternative week with Sonicka's mother Manasa (each have a care percentage (1.1.C.20) of 50%). Manasa has applied for an assessment of child support for William.


Sonicka has $0 child support income, and no other child support cases. Sonicka's liability has been assessed, for the CSP 1 September 2023 to 30 November 2024, at the MAR of $493. As Praful and Manasa each have the equal highest percentage of care, they are each entitled to receive $246.50, half of the MAR.


Example:Michelle and Robert have one child Catherine, who lives with Robert (care percentage is 50%), Michelle's mother Grace (care percentage is 40%) and Michelle (care percentage is 10%). Grace has applied for an assessment of child support for Catherine.


Michelle has $3,000 child support income and no other child support cases. The liability has been assessed, for the CSP 1 September 2024 to 30 November 2025, at the MAR of $519 because this is higher than the formula liability of $510. As Robert has the highest percentage of care, only Robert is entitled to be paid the MAR of $510.


Example:In 2021, Ramona has been assessed in respect of the costs of children in 4 cases. Ramona receives an income support payment and has anATIbelow the self-support amount.

• Assessment 1: Ramona is assessed to pay child support to Albert for one child. The assessment is varied by a court order which sets an annual rate of $260.
• Assessment 2: Ramona is assessed in respect of the costs of 3 children. Ramona and Sven share the care of one child and have sole care of one child each.
• Assessment 3: Ramona is assessed to receive child support from Rashid for one child.
• Assessment 4: Ramona is assessed to pay child support for 2 children who live one week with Thanh and the alternative week with Thanh's mother Thao. Thanh and Thao each have a percentage of care of 50%.

The amount payable for each case where the MAR is applicable is:

• Annual rate for each case = (3 × $446) ÷ 4 = $334.50

Ramona is required to pay the following annual amounts:

• Assessment 1: $260 as required by the court order
• Assessment 2: Nil as Ramona has more than regular care of a child
• Assessment 3: Nil as Ramona is entitled to receive child support
• Assessment 4: $334.50 as Thanh and Thao each have the equal highest percentage of care they are entitled to be paid $167.25 each, half of the portion of MAR payable.

## When can a minimum assessment be reduced to nil?


A parent can apply directly to a court for a departure order (CSA Act section 116(1)(c)) or can apply to the Registrar to have the MAR reduced to nil for a particular CSP (CSA Act section 66A).


A parent must satisfy the Registrar that during the nominated period they have very low income, less than the MAR multiplied by the total number of the parent's child support cases (CSA Act section 66A(2)).


See topic2.3.5for more information on the meaning of income for the purposes of an application for the MAR to not apply.


The information that the parent must provide will depend upon the circumstances of their case and when their application was made. An application may be made during the CSP or after the CSP has ended.


Example:Amanda, who has been assessed in respect of the cost of her child Sam, has been incarcerated since January 2024. For a CSP starting on 16 November 2024, Amanda has been assessed to pay the MAR. Amanda makes an application to have the MAR reduced to nil. Amanda advises that she works in the prison and expects to receive about $7 a day (above the basic amenities allowance) in payment or approximately $1,600 annually. As her income is more than the relevant MAR, the application is refused.


Example:Frank, who has been assessed in respect of the cost of his child Riley, is a resident in a nursing home. For a CSP starting on 7 April 2024, Frank has been assessed to pay the MAR. Frank makes an application to have the MAR reduced to nil. Frank advises that he receives a disability support pension and has no other sources of income. He also advises that at least 85% of his pension is paid to the nursing home for his care. As the pension is excluded by section 13 of the CSA Regs, it is not considered income for the purpose of section 66A of the CSA Act. As Frank's income under section 66A of $0 is less than the relevant MAR, the application is granted.


Example:Siew who is a landlord of a rental property should be able to show that the property would not have been let if the repairs claimed were not carried out.


Although taxable income is calculated by taking the total amount of deductions away from the total amount of assessable income, the Registrar will consider each individual source to determine the parent's income. Losses from one source will not be deducted from income from another source.


Example:A liable parent (1.1.L.30) has applied for a minimum assessment to be reduced to nil for a CSP starting in 2024. The liable parent has only one child support case and has the following income:

• Net dividends $300
• Net interest $80
• Net distribution from family trust $170
• Loss from rental property $500

The loss from the rental property is not taken into account in calculating the liable parent's income. Only net income from each source is considered and losses are not offset against other income. The liable parent's income is $550 ($300 + $80 + $170). The liable parent's application for a reduction will not be accepted as their income is more than the MAR of child support for that period.


## Nominated period


In their application a parent must nominate a period for which they are seeking a reduction of the MAR to nil. This period can be either:

• the whole of a CSP, if they are assessed at a MAR for this entire period (CSA Act section 66A(1)(b)(i)), or
• part of a CSP, if that part is at least 2 months long and they are assessed at a MAR for the nominated period of time (CSA Act section 66A(1)(b)(ii)).

The parent must provide the Registrar with information on the income they received or will receive during the nominated period (CSA Act section 66A(2)).


If a parent wants to reduce their assessments for a period of time that includes more than one CSP, they must make an application for each CSP, or each nominated period within a CSP.


Example:Mitch has been assessed at the MAR since the application for assessment was accepted on 1 February 2019. An assessment was later made for a CSP commencing 1 May 2020. Mitch was not aware of the child support case until August 2020.


Mitch explains that he has been in receipt of a disability support pension since 2018. Mitch can make an application to reduce the MAR to nil for each CSP, or any relevant nominated period of time.


## Decision on application


A parent's application will be granted if the Registrar is satisfied that the parent's annualised income, based on the income for the nominated period, will be less than the amount of the MAR multiplied by the total number of the parent's child support cases (CSA Act section 66A(2)).


A parent's annualised income is calculated in the following way (CSA Act section 66A(3)):

• Annualised income = (parent’s income for the nominated period ÷ number of days in the nominated period) × 365

If a reduction is granted, it will apply to the days in the nominated period that are subject to a minimum assessment.


If the Registrar grants an application to reduce the assessment to nil and the minimum assessment was based on an estimate of income (3.4), the Registrar is still able to amend or reconcile the estimated income, and the liable parent can make a further estimate of income should their circumstances change.


Example:Dalil, who has been assessed in respect of the cost of the children in 3 cases, becomes unemployed on 7 January 2019. The CSP runs from 1 February 2018 to 30 April 2019. On 17 January 2019, Dalil elects to use an estimate of income to have the assessment reflect his changed circumstances. Dalil advises that he will receive no income for the remainder of the CSP as he is being supported by his partner (1.1.P.20). After the assessments have been amended, Dalil is assessed to pay the MAR in 2 of the cases.


Dalil makes an application to have the MAR reduced to nil. After investigation, the Registrar is satisfied with the income information provided for the nominated period, from 17 January 2019 until the end of the CSP. As the Registrar is satisfied that Dalil's income is less than 3 times the relevant MAR, the application is granted. The assessment is reduced to nil for the period 17 January 2019 to 30 April 2019.


Example:Fiona has one child support case with a CSP starting 1 September 2018. The assessment is the MAR. On 1 August 2019 Fiona makes an application for the minimum assessment not to apply. The application is for the period from 1 March 2019 to 22 July 2019 when Fiona was in prison and did not receive any payment other than the basic amenity allowance. The only income Fiona received in that period was $50 in interest income. Fiona has recently been released from prison (on 23 July 2019) and is in receipt of a benefit payment.


In the 144 days between 1 March 2019 and 22 July 2019 Fiona received $50. Fiona's annualised income is $50 ÷ 144 × 365 = $126.74. As Fiona's income is less than one times the relevant MAR, the application is granted.


If the Registrar refuses to grant an application for a reduction, the unsuccessful applicant must be notified in writing (CSA Act section 66C). That person may choose to object to the particulars of the assessment (10.2.2).


If the other parent disagrees with the Registrar's decision to grant the application, they may object to the particulars of the assessment. If they believe that the assessment does not reflect the liable parent's actual capacity to pay child support, they can apply for a change of assessment (5.1).


## Amending an assessment if the reasons to reduce the MAR to nil are no longer satisfied


If after a determination for the MAR to be reduced to nil has been made, the Registrar may amend the assessment to apply the MAR, if the parent no longer meets the conditions for the reduction (CSA Act section 66B(b)).


If the parent has met the conditions for the MAR to be reduced to nil for at least 2 months, the Registrar will amend the assessment from the date:

• of the change in circumstances that led to CSA Act section 66A no longer being satisfied, if that date can be ascertained, or
• the Registrar became aware of the change in circumstances that led to CSA Act section 66A no longer being satisfied.

If the requirements of CSA Act section 66A are found to have never been met, or met for less than 2 months, the Registrar will amend the assessment from the date the minimum assessment was first reduced, if CSA Act section 66A was never in fact satisfied.


Example:Greg has one child support case, in which he is assessed to pay the MAR to Anna for their 2 children. Greg makes an application to reduce the MAR to nil for the entire CSP. The Registrar is satisfied that Greg's income for the nominated period will be less than the relevant MAR. The Registrar makes a decision to reduce the assessment to nil.


Three months later, the Registrar becomes aware that Greg is now working part time. As Greg's income is now more than the MAR, he no longer satisfies the requirements of CSA Act section 66A. The Registrar amends the assessment under CSA Act section 66B to reinstate the MAR from the date that Greg commenced work.


Example:Mandy has one child support case, in which she is assessed to pay the MAR to Seth for their 3 children. Mandy makes an application under CSA Act section 66A to reduce the MAR to nil for the entire CSP. The Registrar is satisfied that Mandy's income for the nominated period will be less than the relevant MAR. The Registrar makes a decision to reduce the assessment to nil.


One month later, the Registrar becomes aware that Mandy is now working. As Mandy's income was less than the MAR for less than 2 months, Mandy did not satisfy the requirements of CSA Act section 66A. The Registrar amends the assessment under CSA Act section 66B to reinstate the MAR from the date the minimum assessment was first reduced.


The Registrar must notify the liable parent in writing that the assessment has been amended and that the MAR is now payable (CSA Act section 66C). The parent can then object to the particulars of the assessment (10.2.2).

# 2.3.5 Fixed annual rate


## Context


TheFAR(1.1.F.10) is a set rate that addresses situations where a parent (1.1.P.10) minimises their taxable income (1.1.T.20) in a way that does not fairly represent their real capacity to pay child support (1.1.C.60), and thereby reduce or avoid the contribution they should make towards meeting the costs of their children. If a parent is genuinely on a low income, they will usually access social security or other income support payments.


Some parents may genuinely be on a low income and either choose not to access income support payments, or may not be eligible to receive such payments (for example, due to their current partner's (1.1.P.20) income). A parent is able to apply forthe FAR not to apply.


If an application for the FAR not to apply is refused and the parent believes their assessment is unfair for other reasons, they may wish to consider applying for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) (Part 5).

• What is the FAR?
• A parent is liable to pay the FAR for more than 3 children
• Paying the FAR to more than one person
• Parent assessed to pay the FAR is also entitled to receive child support in a case
• Applying for the FAR not to apply
• Meaning of income
• Making a decision to accept or refuse a FAR not to apply application
• Amending an assessment if the FAR not to apply conditions are no longer met

## What is the FAR?


The FAR is a prescribed amount paid per child, for up to 3 children in an assessment if (CSA Act section 65A):

• the parent did not receive an income support payment (SS Guide1.1.I.80) in the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10)
• that parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) (actual or estimated) for the last relevant year of income is less than the pensionPP(single) maximum basic amount (2.3.2) (1.1.P.60) as at 1 January of that year, and
• that parent has less than shared care (1.1.S.40) of the child (less than 35% care).

Note:If a parent's ATI has been set at a particular amount by an income amount order (1.1.I.10) (for example, as part of a change of assessment process (CSA Act section 98S(1)(g))), the FAR will not apply. This is because their ATI has not been calculated under CSA Act section 43 (CSA Act section 65A(1)(b)(i)).


Example:Ibrahim is assessed in respect of the costs of their children, Pia and Halvar, for aCSP(1.1.C.150) commencing 1 August 2023. Ibrahim’s ATI for 2022-23 was $19,000 but he did not receive an income support payment in that year of income. Ibrahim’s ATI is less than the 2023 relevant pension PP (single) maximum basic amount of $23,800. Ibrahim has regular care (1.1.R.50) of Pia and Halvar.


As Ibrahim does not have at least shared care of either of the children, the assessment is made applying the FAR for each child. The amount payable is $1,632 for each child, a total of $3,264.


## A parent is liable to pay the FAR for more than 3 children


If the FAR assessment is payable for more than 3 children, then the amount payable is capped at 3 times the FAR (CSA Act section 65A(3)). The amount payable for each child is calculated according to the following formula (CSA Act section 65A(4)):

• Amount for each child = 3 × FAR ÷ total number of children for whom child support is payable by the parent (CSA Act subsection 65A(1)).

Example:In a CSP commencing in 2023, Clementine is assessed to pay child support to Alex for their children, Selina and Able. Clementine is also assessed to pay child support to Verity for their children Laura, Dan and Lukas. In total, Clementine is liable to pay child support for 5 children in 2 separate child support assessments (1.1.C.70). Clementine does not have at least shared care of any of the children.


As Clementine did not receive an income support payment in the last relevant year of income (2021-22) and her ATI is less than the relevant parenting payment (single) amount, Clementine has been assessed to pay the FAR.

• The amount payable for each child is 3 × $1,632 ÷ 5 = $979.
• The annual rate payable to Alex is $979 × 2 = $1,958.
• The annual rate payable to Verity is $979 × 3 = $2,937.

## Paying the FAR to more than one person


If the care (1.1.C.10) of a child is shared between a parent and a non-parent carer, or between 2 non-parent carers, then the FAR payment is shared between the carers in accordance with the formula in CSA Act section 40A (CSA Act section 65A(5)):

• Total rate the parent and non-parent carers are entitled to be paid for the day × (parent's or non-parent carer's cost percentage (1.1.C.200) for the child ÷ total of parent's and non-parent carer's cost percentage for the child).

A non-parent carer is not entitled to be paid child support unless they have at least 35% care of the child and they have applied under CSA Act section 25A in relation to the child (CSA Act section 40B).


Example:Ariston and Simona have one child Melanie, who lives one week with Simona and one week with Ariston's mother, Donata. Simona and Donata each have a cost percentage of 50%. Ariston does not have care of Melanie. Donata has applied for an assessment of child support for Melanie. As Ariston is assessed to pay the FAR.


The amount Ariston is required to pay to each carer for Melanie is:

• $1,632 × (50 ÷ 100)
• The annual rate payable to Simona is $1,632 × 0.5 = $816.
• The annual rate payable to Donata is $1,632 × 0.5 = $816.

## Parent assessed to pay the FAR is also entitled to receive child support in a case


The FAR amount payable by a parent in relation to the child is subject to any offsetting of amounts calculated as payable by the other parent before the final amount payable by the first parent is determined (CSA Act section 67A).


Example:Nathan and Susanne have 2 children, Johanna and Ane. Johanna lives with Nathan and Ane lives with Susanne. The cost of each child for a CSP commencing in 2023, calculated using the basic formula (1.1.B.10), is $920. Susanne is assessed to pay the FAR for Johanna.

• Nathan is liable to pay $920 to Susanne for Ane, the child in Susanne's care.
• Susanne is liable to pay $1,632 to Nathan for Johanna, the child in Nathan's care.

The amounts payable are offset against each other and Susanne is required to pay the difference of $712 to Nathan.


## Applying for the FAR not to apply


If a parent is assessed to pay the FAR, they can apply for the FAR not to apply (CSA Act section 65B(1)(a)). If a determination had been made immediately before the end of the previous CSP that the FAR should not apply (under CSA Act section 65B(4)), then the parent is deemed to have made an application that the FAR not apply in the new CSP (CSA Act section 65B(1)(b)).


The parent making the application must provide evidence that:

• their current income (not ATI) is no more than the relevant pension PP (single) maximum basic amount (CSA Act section 65B(2)(a)), and
• it would be unjust and inequitable to expect them to pay the FAR (CSA Act section 65B(2)(b)).

An application for the FAR not to apply will only be accepted if the Registrar is satisfied that the parent's current income is no more than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount (2.3.2). If the parent's current income is more than the relevant pension PP (single) maximum basic amount, the application must be refused (CSA Act section 65B(4)).


The Registrar must also be satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable to expect the parent to pay the FAR (CSA Act section 65B(4)). The Registrar may decide that it would not be unjust and inequitable to require the parent to pay the FAR despite their income being low.


## Meaning of income


Income is defined as (CSA Act section 66A(4)):

• any money received, earned or derived for personal use or benefit, or
• any periodic payment by way of gift or allowance.

In making this decision, the Registrar will consider whether the parent's income accurately reflects their real capacity to pay child support, including whether the parent receives goods, services or benefits which mean that their current income is not an accurate representation of their financial position.


A parent's current income is generally their income for the 12-month period from the date of the application.


The Registrar must use the definition of income to determine if the parent's current income is no more than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount. An income tax assessment for the last relevant year of income will not be sufficient evidence of the parent's income.


The exclusions to income are prescribed in the regulations (CSA Regs section 13):

• amenity allowances or gratuities (incidental payments for personal items or other minor expenses, but not payments for work, study or participation in approved programs) paid to prisoners
• disability support pensions, pensions paid to veterans who are totally and permanently incapacitated and Special Rate Disability Pension for veterans, where at least 85% of the pension is paid to another person for the provision of ongoing care to the pension recipient
• a National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) amount (as defined in theNational Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013), and
• payments of 'redress' within the meaning of theNational Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018.

In considering a parent's financial circumstances, 'money':

• includes coins and bank notes, cheques and deposits into bank accounts (but not goods, services, or some other benefit, even if the payment is capable of being valued in money terms)
• is 'earned' when it is received in return for labour or service, in compensation or as profit
• is taken to be 'derived' in accordance with ordinary business and commercial principles including capital payments, trust distributions and royalties
• is taken to be 'received' when it comes into a person's possession (This covers most money which comes into a person's hands including capital payments, for example, a tax refund, Lotto wins, lump sum compensation, profit from the sale of an asset, deposits into a joint bank account)
• must be received for the person's own use or benefit (Income received by a person in another capacity is not included).

Example:A trustee does not receive trust funds for their own use or benefit.


Example:A partner only receives money for their own use or benefit when the person receives their individual share of the partnership profit.


Only net income is considered. The Registrar will deduct the person's expenses (that would be recognised for taxation purposes) that directly relate to them earning the particular type of income from their gross income. However, 'paper expenses' (such as depreciation of property or assets, or carried forward losses) should not be deducted as they are not considered to relate directly to earning the income and do not reduce cash flow.


If expenses claimed are discretionary (for example, repairs to a rental property), the Registrar must be satisfied that they were necessary before they will be deducted from the parent’s income.


Example:Siew who is a landlord of a rental property should be able to show that the property would not have been let if the repairs claimed were not carried out.


Although taxable income is calculated by taking the total amount of deductions away from the total amount of assessable income, the Registrar will consider each individual source to determine if the amounts in total are no more than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount. Losses from one source will not be deducted from income from another source.


Example:A liable parent (1.1.L.30) has made an application for the FAR not to apply for a CSP starting 1 August 2019. The liable parent has an ATI of $14,300. For CSA Act section 66A(4) purposes, the parent's separate types of income are identified as:

• employment income $14,300
• superannuation pension $5,000 (not taxable)
• lotto win $1,700
• loss from share investments $4,000.

The loss from the share investments is not taken into account in calculating the parent's income. Only net income from each source is considered and losses are not offset against other income. The parent's income is $21,000 ($14,300 + $5,000 + $1,700).


Note:The superannuation pension and the lotto win (both non-taxable income) have been included in calculating the income for CSA Act section 66A(4) purposes. The parent's application for the FAR to not be used will not be granted as the total income exceeds the relevant parenting payment (single) maximum basic amount ($23,800 in 2023).


Example:Noor is assessed to pay child support to Uri for their children Florinda and Petra. Noor has regular care of Florinda and Petra. Noor did not receive an income support payment in the last relevant year of income and had an ATI of less than the relevant pension PP (single) maximum basic amount. The assessment has been made using the FAR.


Noor makes an application for the FAR not to apply. Noor does not receive any income support payments due to the income of their current partner. Noor has no other sources of income and does not receive any non-monetary benefits that are relevant to the assessment.


The Registrar is satisfied that Noor's current income is no more than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount. The Registrar is also satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable to expect Noor to pay the FAR. A determination is made under CSA Act section 65B(4) that the FAR not apply.


As Noor has regular care of the children, and is contributing to theCOTC(1.1.C.210) through care, theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support does not apply. Noor is not required to pay child support for Florinda and Petra.


Example:Justina is assessed to pay child support to Kumar for their children Esra and Shantel. Justina has regular care of Esra and Shantel. The assessment has been made applying the FAR.


Justina makes an application for the FAR to not be used. Justina has an ATI of $10,000 and is a director of a family business which operates through a trust. Justina provides financial records regarding the business. The Registrar determines that Justina receives goods, services or benefits with a significant annual value through the business.


The Registrar decides that Justina's income of $10,000 does not fairly represent Justina's real capacity to pay child support, and that it is not unjust and inequitable to require Justina to pay the FAR. Justina's application is, therefore, refused.


Example:Adam is assessed to pay child support to Fausta for their children Igon and Irene. Adam has regular care of Igon and Irene. The assessment has been made applying the FAR. Adam makes an application for the FAR not to apply. Adam has an ATI of $10,000 and receives a superannuation pension (not taxable) of $15,000.


As Adam's current income of $25,000 is more than the relevant parenting payment (single) maximum basic amount the application must be refused.


## Making a decision to accept or refuse a FAR not to apply application


When making a decision to accept an application for the FAR not to apply the Registrar must consider, and be satisfied of the following:

• the parent’s current income is not more than the relevant pension PP (single) maximum basic amount (CSA Act section 65B(4))
• it would be unjust and inequitable for the parent to pay the FAR (CSA Act section 65B(4))
• if the parent’s income accurately reflects their real capacity to pay child support, for example are they in receipt of goods, services or benefits which mean their income is not an accurate representation of their true financial position.

If an application is granted, the Registrar will specify the day the FAR ceases to apply to the parent (CSA Act section 65B(5)). In most cases, the Registrar will specify that the determination will apply from the first day in the CSP on which the FAR was payable. However, if making a determination that the FAR will not apply from the beginning of the CSP would create an overpayment for the payee (1.1.P.30), generally the Registrar will specify that the determination will apply from a date after the start of the CSP, for example, the date the application was made. In making this decision, the Registrar will consider the reasons for any delay in making the application.


If the FAR applies to only part of the CSP (for example, where the parent lodged an estimate of income after the beginning of the CSP), the determination not to apply a FAR will not apply to the earlier part of the CSP.


When the Registrar refuses to grant the application, the unsuccessful applicant must be notified in writing (CSA Act section 66C). That person can then object (10.2.2) to the particulars of the assessment.


## Amending an assessment if the FAR not to apply conditions are no longer met


The Registrar may amend the assessment to reapply the FAR if the parent no longer meets the required conditions (CSA Act section 66B(b)) from the date:

• a change in circumstances occurred, if that date can be determined
• the FAR was first not applied, if the conditions are later found to have never been satisfied, or
• the Registrar became aware a change in circumstances has occurred that mean the conditions are no longer met.

Example:Magdalena was assessed to pay the FAR to Elias for their children Alan and Ilija. Magdalena made an application for the FAR not to apply. The Registrar agreed that the FAR should not be used from the start of the CSP.


Three months later, the Registrar became aware that Magdalena had always been working and the information in the application for the FAR not to apply was inaccurate and incomplete. As Magdalena's current income is in fact more than the pension PP (single) maximum basic amount, the FAR should apply. The Registrar amends the assessment to reinstate the FAR from the start of the CSP.


The Registrar must notify the liable parent in writing that the FAR will again apply and that the assessment has been amended (CSA Act section 66C). That person can then object (10.2.2) to the particulars of the assessment.

# 2.4 Child support periods


## Introduction


This chapter describes the start and end dates ofCSPs (1.1.C.150) and which financial year of income (1.1.Y.10) the Registrar will use when making a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) for a CSP.


## Frequently asked questions


### Will a new child support agreement always start a new CSP?


No. In an existing case, a child support agreement will start a new CSP only if it affects the rate of child support (1.1.C.60) payable.


The date that the new CSP starts will depend on the date of the application for acceptance of the agreement, the date the agreement was signed, the terms of the agreement and the date on which child support first became payable under the administrative assessment (1.1.A.30). If a case starts with a child support agreement, a new CSP starts on the day the application was made to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement.


### Does a change of assessment or departure order start a new CSP?


No. Nor does a CSP end when the change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision or departure order ends.


### Does a CSP end at the end of a child support agreement, change of assessment decision, or departure order?


No. The existing assessment continues after the end of a child support agreement, change of assessment decision or departure order. The case will revert to the usual formula assessment (1.1.F.20) for the rest of the CSP. The last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10) will stay the same (the last year of income that ended before the start of the period).


The Registrar may be required to make a new assessment if a later tax assessment has issued during the life of the agreement, change of assessment decision or departure. If so, it will make the assessment during the last month that the decision, order or agreement had effect, and it will apply to a CSP that starts on the first day of the following month.

# 2.4.1 When do child support periods start?


## Context


A newCSP(1.1.C.150) starts when the Registrar makes a new child support assessment (1.1.C.70). The Registrar makes assessments using the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10) for the CSP to which the assessment will apply (section 43).


Amending an assessment (that is, adding a new child, or updating an income) does not start a new CSP.


## Act reference

## When the Registrar is required to make a new child support assessment


The Registrar must make new assessments, which apply to new CSPs, in the following circumstances.


### Accepting an application for assessment


The Registrar must make an assessment as quickly as practicable after accepting a new application for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support (1.1.C.60) (section 31(1)). The CSP for this assessment starts on the day the application was received (section 7A(2)(a)).


Note:A new CSP will not be initiated by:

• the acceptance of an application from a non-parent carer to receive child support under an existing child support assessment (meaning, there is already an assessment between the parents (1.1.P.10) for the child and no terminating event has occurred) (section 40B(3)), and
• the acceptance of an application to add a new child to an existing case.

Instead, the Registrar will amend the existing assessment to take account of these events.


### Accepting a child support agreement that starts a new case


The Registrar must make an assessment as quickly as practicable after accepting a child support agreement that starts a new case (section 93(2)). An assessment and CSP will start on the day the liability to pay child support starts, that is from the day the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar (section 7A(2)(b) and section 93(1)(g)).


### Accepting a child support agreement on an existing case where the agreement affects the rate of child support payable


The Registrar must make a new assessment immediately after accepting a child support agreement in an existing case if the agreement affects the rate of child support payable (section 34B(1)). The new assessment applies to a new CSP that starts on the day the agreement alters the rate of child support payable (section 7A(2)(c)). For more details of the date of effect of a child support agreement where child support is already payable, see6.3.


### The Registrar makes an assessment when theATOissues an income tax assessment for one of the parents


The Registrar must make a new assessment when an income tax assessment issues for either parent for the latest financial year that ended during the existing CSP (section 34A). The Registrar must do this as soon as it is practicable after the ATO issues the assessment (section 34A(2)).


Generally, it is practicable to make an assessment in the month the tax assessment issues if it issues on or before the 15th of the month. If the tax assessment issues after the 15th of the month the Registrar will generally make the assessment in the following month and commence the assessment and a new CSP on the first of the month after that.


The new assessment applies to a new CSP that starts on the first day of the month after the month in which the assessment was made (section 34A(2) and section 7A(2)(d)).


## When the Registrar is not required to make a new child support assessment


The Registrar may not be required to make a new child support assessment and start a new CSP when the ATO issues an income tax assessment (for the latest year of income that ended during the existing CSP) in 4 circumstances.


### Income tax assessment could not affect the rate of child support


A new child support assessment is not required where the tax assessment could not affect the rate of child support payable, for example because the parent's income continues to be below the self-support amount (1.1.S.20) (section 34A(3)(a)).


Example:Casey has a care percentage (1.1.C.20) of 100% for 2 children. The assessment is based on the last relevant income for Casey of $18,140 and for the other parent, George, of $36,314. On 14 July 2021, Casey's 2020-21 tax return issues and theATI(1.1.A.20) is $17,135.


As Casey's income continues to be below the self-support amount and will not affect the rate of child support payable, the Registrar is not required to make a new assessment and start a new CSP.


Casey's 2020-21 income will be used in the new CSP which will commence after the end of the 15-month period or after George lodges a tax return with an ATI that affects the rate of child support payable (whichever is earlier).


Example:Sarah has a care percentage of 100% for 2 children. The assessment is based on the last relevant income for Sarah of $37,400 and the other parent, Chris, of $36,314. On 10 July 2021, Sarah's 2020-21 tax return issues and the ATI is $17,135.


As Sarah's income is lower than the income that is currently used in the assessment, and this will affect the rate of child support payable, the Registrar is required to make a new assessment and start a new CSP from 1 August 2021.


### A new CSP has already started during the current financial year


A new child support assessment is not required where a new CSP has already started during the income year. For example, a new CSP has started because the Registrar has accepted a new agreement, or the other parent's income tax assessment for that year has already started a new CSP.


Example:Peta and Steven's child support assessment commenced on 1 April 2021 with an annual rate of $2,146 based on the 2019-20 taxable incomes (1.1.T.20).


Peta lodges her tax return and, on 28 September 2021, her 2020-21 tax assessment becomes available. A new CSP starts on 1 November 2021 using Peta's 2020-21 ATI of $47,236 and a provisional ATI of $32,231, determined by the Registrar, for Steven.


Steven's 2020-21 tax return issues on 3 December 2021 and his ATI is $34,635. As a new CSP has already started during the income year (to use Peta's ATI of $47,236), the Registrar will not be required to make a new assessment and start a new CSP because of Steven's tax return issuing.


When the assessment was made, an income determined by the Registrar will have been used for the parent (or parents) whose income tax assessment had not yet issued. When the parent's income tax assessment subsequently issues for the same year, it does not trigger a new CSP. The income tax assessment is not for a financial year that ended during the current CSP. The Registrar will amend the existing assessment by replacing the Registrar determined income. The assessment continues and applies to the same CSP.


Similarly, if an amended tax assessment issues for either parent, it will not start a new CSP, but the Registrar may amend the existing assessment to take into account the amended tax assessment.


### Assessment based on a change of assessment decision, court order or agreement


A new child support assessment is not required where a change of assessment decision, court order or child support agreement is in place that does not use the parent's taxable income to work out the rate of child support (section 34A(3)(b)).


If the child support agreement, change of assessment decision or court order ceases at any time during the existing CSP, the Registrar is required to make a new assessment when the income tax assessment will affect the rate of child support. The Registrar makes a new assessment during the last calendar month in which the child support agreement, change of assessment decision, or court order has effect. This new assessment applies to a period that starts on the first day of the month following the making of the assessment (section 34A(2)).


Most child support agreements, court orders and change of assessment decisions will end on the last day of a month. If not, the assessment will revert to the formula using the last relevant year of income for the current CSP until the last day of the month. The new assessment using the later year of income will apply to a period that commences on the first day of the month after which the Registrar makes that assessment (section 34A(2)).


### Current CSP ending in the same month


A new child support assessment is not required where the existing CSP will finish before the end of the month in which the income tax assessment issues. In these cases, a new CSP starts on the day after the end of the current CSP, rather than the first day of the following month (section 34A(3)(c)).


## Can a CSP start retrospectively when a new tax figure is available?


If the Registrar missed making a new assessment when a parent's income tax assessment issued, a retrospective assessment cannot be made (section 34A(2)). The Registrar will make a new assessment at the earliest appropriate time, noting the general rule for practicability outlined above. If a new financial year has started before the Registrar discovers the error, and the last relevant year of income has therefore changed, the Registrar will not be able to make a new assessment based on that income tax assessment. However, the Registrar can amend the existing child support assessment using financial information from the income tax assessment if the information is more accurate for the purposes of the assessment.


## Income tax assessment issues in June for the previous financial year


When the ATO issues an income tax assessment that requires the Registrar to make a new assessment, a new CSP starts. The new income tax assessment will relate to the parent's taxable income for the last relevant year of income in relation to the new CSP. The exception is where the Registrar makes a new child support assessment in June to apply to a CSP that starts on 1 July (for example, when the ATO issue an income tax assessment for 2020-21 in June 2022). The last relevant year of income for the new CSP will be the financial year after the year of the income tax assessment that is, 2021-22.


For these cases, the Registrar will make a new child support assessment based upon a provisional income (1.1.P.130) amount for the last relevant year of income for both parents (3.3). When the ATO issues each parent's income tax assessment for the last relevant year of income, the Registrar will amend the child support assessment from the start of the CSP (replacing the provisional income with the actual income in accordance with the date of effect rules outlined in3.3.3).


Example:A CSP commenced on 1 June 2022 involving parents Elisabeth and Maddi. The last relevant year of income for the CSP is 2020-21. On 3 June 2023, Maddi lodges their tax return for the 2021-22 income year. Elisabeth has not yet lodged their tax return for the 2021-22 income year. A new CSP will commence from 1 July 2024. The last relevant year of income for the CSP commencing on 1 July 2024 is 2022-23, not 2021-22. A provisional income for 2022-23 will be used in the child support assessment for both Elisabeth and Maddi until their respective ATO assessments are available.


## After the end of a CSP


The Registrar must make an assessment before the start of a new CSP if an assessment has not already been made for one of the reasons listed above. If the Registrar has not made a new assessment before the start of a new CSP this must be done as soon as practicable after it starts (section 34C). The CSP for this kind of assessment will start on the first day after the day the earlier CSP ended (section 7A(2)(d)).

# 2.4.2 When do child support periods end?


## Context


When the Registrar makes a new child support assessment (1.1.C.70), both the old assessment andCSP(1.1.C.150) will end. The new CSP starts on the day after the former CSP ends.


## Explanation


A CSP will end at whichever of the following days occur first (section 7A(3)):

• CSP 15-month rule - a CSP cannot exceed 15 months (section 7A(3)(a)). The CSP will end on the day 15 months after the start of the period.
• Income tax assessment has issued - the Registrar will make a new assessment when an income tax assessment has issued for one of the parents (1.1.P.10). The current CSP will end on the last day of the month in which the Registrar makes the new assessment (section 7A(3)(b)). The new CSP will start on the first day of the following month.
• The Registrar has accepted a child support agreement (section 7A(3)(c) to (d)), - the CSP in an existing case will end on the day before the rate of child support changes.

# 2.5.2 Assessment notices


## Context


When the Registrar makes an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30), an assessment notice (1.1.A.120) must be immediately given in writing to each parent (1.1.P.10) and any non-parent carer applicant.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 69, section 76


## Information included in a notice of assessment


The following information must be included in the assessment notice (CSA Act section 76):

• theannual and daily ratesof child support (1.1.C.60) payable
• theATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20) and child support income (3.1) (1.1.C.120) of any parent assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210) (2.3.1) in the child support case (1.1.C.80) to which the assessment relates (assessed parent)
• the names and dates of birth of each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates
• the number and age ranges of any relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60) of an assessed parent
• if a parent has other child support cases, the number and age ranges of the children in those other child support cases
• a parent's percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates
• if there is a non-parent carer, the non-parent carer's percentage of care for each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates
• the costs of each child in the child support case to which the assessment relates
• if a child support agreement includes lump sum payment provisions (1.1.L.60), or if a court has made an order under CSA Act section 123A (10.4.2) in respect of the children in the child support case to which the assessment relates, then the notice must also includethe amount of the lump sum payment specified in the agreement or orderthe amount of any remaining lump sum payment (within the meaning of the CSRC Act), andany annual rate (1.1.A.70) and daily rate of child support that remains payable under CSA Act section 78 after taking into account any remaining lump sum payment that will be credited under CSRC Act section 69A
• the amount of the lump sum payment specified in the agreement or order
• the amount of any remaining lump sum payment (within the meaning of the CSRC Act), and
• any annual rate (1.1.A.70) and daily rate of child support that remains payable under CSA Act section 78 after taking into account any remaining lump sum payment that will be credited under CSRC Act section 69A
• any other matters that are prescribed by regulation (currently no other matters are prescribed).

If an administrative assessment is calculated in accordance with either an order made by a court under CSA Act Division 4 of Part 7, or the provisions of a child support agreement accepted under Part 6, then the assessment notice does not need to include any information, as mentioned above, that is not relevant to the making of the assessment (CSA Act section 76(2A)).


Example:The annual rate of child support payable was set by a court as a result of a departure application. As the incomes of the parents are not relevant to the making of the assessment, the assessment notice will not include income information.


The notice must also include, or be accompanied by, information about the rights of the parents or any non-parent carer to (CSA Act section 76(3)):

• object, subject to the CSRC Act, to the particulars of the assessment (10.2.2)
• apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of an objection (1.1.O.10) decision, if aggrieved by that decision (10.3.2)
• apply to the ART for second review of an ART decision in relation to the percentages of care in the assessment, if aggrieved by the ART decision
• apply to the Registrar for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) under Part 6A of the CSA Act (Part 5)
• apply to a court for an order under CSA Act section 123A (10.4.2) that the parent provide child support for the child in the form of a lump sum payment to be credited against that parent's liability under any relevant administrative assessment, and
• apply to a court for an order under CSA Act section 124 that a parent provide child support for the child in a form other than a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) (10.4.2).

## Annual & daily rates


When the Registrar assesses the annual rate of child support payable by a parent, the assessment notice must state the liability as both an annual rate and a daily rate (CSA Act section 69).


The Registrar converts the annual rate of child support to a daily rate by dividing the annual rate by 365.25 (CSA Regs section 14). The calculation is rounded to 5 decimal places.


Example:The annual rate is $2,652. $2,652 divided by 365.25 is 7.260780. As the 6th decimal digit (in this case 0) is less than 5, this is rounded down to 7.26078.


If the annual rate is $2,653, $2,653 divided by 365.25 is 7.263518. As the 6th decimal (8) is 5 or more, the result is rounded up to 7.26352.

# 2.6.1 Suspension of liability to pay child support when parents reconcile


## Context


If the Registrar is satisfied that 2 separated (1.1.S.30) parents (1.1.P.10) have reconciled, payment of child support (1.1.C.60) will be suspended (unless the child support is payable to a non-parent carer). If, however, the parents separate again within 6 months, then either parent can reinstate the assessment without having to make a new application for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support. Where parents remain reconciled for a period of 6 months or more, the administrative assessment will end.


## Act references

## Suspension of child support liability when parents reconcile


When reconciliation (1.1.R.20) occurs between parents with a child support case (1.1.C.80), they should notify the Registrar that they are now members of the same couple. In some cases, Centrelink may advise the Registrar that the parents have reconciled.


Once the Registrar is satisfied that the parents have reconciled, the Registrar will make a determination (a 'suspension determination') that child support is not payable for a child by a liable parent (1.1.L.30) to the other parent of the child. This means that child support does not accrue against the liable parent during this period (CSA Act sections 150E(1) and 150E(2)).


If the Registrar makes a suspension determination, child support is not payable from the date the Registrar determines that the parents became members of the same couple (CSA Act section 150E(2)).


The suspension determination ends the effect of the child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


For example, any child of the reconciled parents (that is living with them) is able to be treated as a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) if either of the parents has another child support case (CSA Act section 150E(6)).


## Payment of child support to continue if reconciliation unsuccessful within 6 months


If the Registrar is satisfied that the parents cease to be a couple within 6 months of the start of the reconciliation, the Registrar must then make a determination that child support is again payable (except where a child support terminating event has already happened) (CSA Act sections 12(5) and 150E(3), and also see2.6.3on terminating events).


When the Registrar makes a determination that child support is again payable, it is payable from the day the Registrar is satisfied that the parents' reconciliation ended (CSA Act section 150E(4)).


Example:Concetto and Isabella have a child support case with 2 children Jana and Hilary. Jana and Hilary live with Isabella, and Concetto pays child support to Isabella.


Concetto and Isabella decide to reconcile and Concetto moves into Isabella's home on 2 July 2020. On 5 July 2020, Isabella and Concetto notify the Registrar that they reconciled on 2 July 2020. The Registrar then makes a 'suspension determination' that from 2 July 2020 child support is no longer payable by Concetto to Isabella.


On 2 September 2020 Concetto and Isabella decide their reconciliation is not working and they separate. Concetto moves out on the same day. On 10 September 2020 Isabella notifies the Registrar that the reconciliation ended on 2 September 2020 and the Registrar confirms this with Concetto. The Registrar then makes a determination that child support is again payable from 2 September 2020.


No child support amounts were accruing for the period while the parents were reconciled, that is, between 2 July and 1 September 2020.


## Reconciliation for less than 6 months wholly in the past


A parent may advise the Registrar that they and the other parent reconciled for a period of less than 6 months in the past, but have now re-separated. If the Registrar is satisfied that the parents did reconcile on a particular date when there was a child support assessment in place, and then separated again within 6 months of their reconciliation, the Registrar will make a suspension determination in relation to the time when the parents were reconciled (provided that the date of reconciliation was after 1 July 2008).


## Terminating event if parents reconcile for 6 months or more


Where parents reconcile for a period of 6 months or more, this is a child support terminating event (2.6.3). A 'terminating event' ends an administrative assessment (CSA Act sections 12(5) and 150E(2)). If the parents separate after this time, and they want child support to again be assessed, then either parent can make a new application for an administrative assessment.


Example:Brandon and Susan have a child support case with 2 children Nikita and Jacob. Nikita and Jacob live with Susan, and Brandon pays Susan child support.


Brandon and Susan decide to get back together and Brandon moves into Susan's home on 2 July 2021. On 5 July 2021, Centrelink notifies the Registrar that Brandon and Susan reconciled on 2 July 2021. The Registrar then makes a 'suspension determination' that from 2 July 2021 child support is not payable by Brandon to Susan for Nikita and Jacob.


On 2 January 2022 (6 months after Brandon and Susan first reconciled) the administrative assessment ends as a child support terminating event has occurred on 2 January 2022.


If Brandon and Susan were to separate more than 6 months after they reconciled (that is, after their child support assessment has ended) one of them would need to make a new application if they again wanted a child support assessment.


## Non-parent carers


Child support is still payable by a liable parent to a non-parent carer irrespective of the parents' reconciliation and any suspension determination made by the Registrar as a result (CSA Act section 150E(5)).


## Collection of child support arrears during suspension determination


The making of a suspension determination does not of itself automatically end collection of any child support arrears (1.1.A.100) by the Registrar that exist at the time of the reconciliation. The Registrar may continue to collect arrears while the suspension determination is in place.


However, parents can discuss their options regarding the collection of arrears during the suspension period with Services Australia. For instance, if the liability is registered for collection with the Registrar, before the suspension determination is made, a payee (1.1.P.30) may make an election under CSRC Act section 38A for the Registrar to end collection of the liability and not to collect any arrears (see7.3.1.10on electing to end collection).


The payee may also elect to end the administrative assessment (CSA Act section 151) (2.6.2) rather than continue with the suspension period. The payee may opt to finalise arrears by making an election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears. See7.3.1.10on electing to end collection.


## Review rights


Services Australia's internal review (objection (1.1.O.10)) process allows parents to ask the Registrar to formally reconsider particular decisions made under child support legislation.


When the Registrar makes a decision to suspend an administrative assessment or a determination that child support is again payable the Registrar will amend the administrative assessment to reflect those decisions. Accordingly, the Registrar will also vary the Child Support Register to reflect the amendments made to the assessment. Either parent of a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) has the right to object to the particulars varied in the Child Support Register (CSRC Act sections 37A, 42C and 80(1), and also see10.2for more information on objecting to decisions of the Registrar).

# 2.6.2 Electing to end an assessment


## Context


A carer entitled to receive child support (1.1.C.60) can end an assessment for a child by electing to end the liability from a specified day in the future.


In some circumstances, the parent liable to pay child support under a child support agreement may also elect to end the liability.

• FTB impacts for ending an assessment
• Election to end assessments & child support agreements

## Act references


CSA Actsection 12(4), section 86, section 93, section 151


Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018Schedule 1 item 74


## When can a carer elect to end an assessment?


A carer entitled to receive child support can elect to end an assessment for a child from a specified day (CSA Act section 151(1)). The specified day must be a day after the election to end the assessment is made (CSA Act section 12(4)).


When an assessment is ended on a certain date, assessments made in relation to periods before that date remain in force. Retrospective variations to past assessments may result in an overpayment (1.1.O.20) or underpayment of child support.


An election to end an assessment for a child (under CSA Act section 151) is a 'terminating event'. When an election to end an assessment has been made and the Registrar ends the assessment, the terminating event cannot be reversed. However, either parent or any eligible carer (1.1.E.10) is entitled to make a new application for an assessment.


## FTB impacts for ending an assessment


If the carer or their current partner (1.1.P.20) is receiving or is entitled to receiveFTBPart A at more than the base rate and they elect to end the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), their FTB Part A rate may be reduced to the base rate if they have not been granted an exemption from theMAT(FA Guide3.1.5.70).


## Election to end assessments & child support agreements


### No unilateral termination of a child support agreement


An election to end an assessment for a child under section 151 of the CSA Act is a terminating event and child support ceases to be payable under a child support agreement. However, when the person who elected to end the assessment applies for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support before the liability under the child support agreement would have otherwise ended, the child support agreement revives and any new assessment must be based on the child support agreement (6.4).


Note:If a child support agreement is made on or after 23 May 2018:


If an agreement was made on or after 23 May 2018 and the agreement states it will end if a terminating event occurs, this reference in the agreement is not taken to mean a terminating event resulting from an election to end the assessment. This ensures a child support agreement made on or after 23 May 2018 would not terminate if a unilateral election by either payee (1.1.P.30) or payer (1.1.P.40) under section 151 of the CSA Act to end the administrative assessment.


Note:If a child support agreement is made before 23 May 2018:


If an agreement was made before 23 May 2018 and the agreement states it will end if a terminating event occurs, depending on the wording of the agreement, the child support agreement will end and will not be revived under a new assessment.


### Electing to end an assessment when an initiating child support agreement is suspended


When a binding child support agreement (1.1.B.30) is used to initiate a child support case (1.1.C.80), there is no underlying assessment and therefore no child support will be payable when the agreement is suspended due to a care (1.1.C.10) change.


From 1 July 2018, any party to a child support agreement can elect to end the assessment where:

• a child support agreement initiated the assessment (CSA section 93 (2)), and
• the agreement is suspended (CSA Act section 86).

When a child support agreement is suspended (CSA Act section 86) and child support is not payable because of the suspension (CSA Act section 93(1A)), any party to the agreement may give notice to the Registrar to elect to end the liability to pay child support (CSA Act section 151(1A)).


In situations where a parent liable to pay child support under the agreement becomes an eligible carer, the parent may elect to end the section 93(2) assessment where the other parent in the agreement is not an eligible carer (CSA Act section 151(1A)).


If the liable parent (1.1.L.30) in the agreement applies for a new formula assessment (1.1.F.20) and the Registrar makes a new assessment (under CSA Act section 31), the child support agreement will revive if the liability to pay child support under the child support agreement has not ended (CSA Act section 142(1B)). The child support agreement revives at the start of the day the parent makes the application for a new assessment (CSA Act section 142(1C)). As soon as the agreement revives, the agreement is suspended (CSA Act section 86) since the parent entitled to be paid child support under the agreement is not an eligible carer. As the agreement has no effect on the formula assessment under CSA Act section 35C(c) because of the suspension, the liable parent under the agreement, who is now an eligible carer, can be assessed and potentially receive child support payments under child support formula (1.1.C.110) provisions during an agreement suspension period.


In order to end the agreement, the liable parent must use the termination methods in6.4. If the former eligible carer does not become an eligible carer again after a 28-day suspension period or after an extended suspension period elected or provided for in the agreement, the agreement will terminate.

# 2.5.4 Amending assessments


## Context


The Registrar can amend a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) to take into account changed circumstances.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 12, section 54F, section 54FA, section 54G, section 54H, section 54HA, section 73A, section 74, section 74A, section 75


Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2008Schedule 3 Part 1


Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Act 2010


## On this page

• When can the Registrar amend an assessment?
• Adding a relevant dependent child
• Giving effect to terminating events or changes in circumstances

## When can the Registrar amend an assessment?


The Registrar can amend an assessment at any time to give effect to the provisions of the CSA Act or the CSRC Act (CSA Act section 75). An assessment can be amended even if:

• child support (1.1.C.60) has been paid
• theCSP(1.1.C.150) has ended, or
• there areART(1.1.A.40) or court proceedings pending in relation to the assessment.

The reasons why an assessment may be amended include (but are not limited to):

• correcting any error or mistake (whether or not made by the Registrar)
• correcting the effect of any false or misleading statement made to the Registrar
• giving effect to a terminating event
• giving effect to a care determination (4.1.5), including an interim care determination (4.2)
• giving effect to a change in a parent's (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer's percentage of care (1.1.P.70) (4.1.5)
• giving effect to an event or change of circumstances that affects the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support
• giving effect to the Registrar's acceptance of a child support agreement
• giving effect to a decision of the ART, or
• giving effect to a decision or order of a court which has jurisdiction under either the CSA Act, CSRC Act or ARTAct.

The Registrar will amend an assessment where the amendment is necessary to give effect to a provision of the CSA Act or CSRC Act, either expressly or impliedly (CSA Act section 75).


Example:If there is a decision to allow an objection (1.1.O.10), the Registrar will amend the assessment to give effect to the decision.


The Registrar cannot make an amendment that contravenes a specific provision of the CSA Act or CSRC Act.


Where either parent (or non-parent carer) is dissatisfied with a decision, they can use the available administrative processes in the child support legislation to have that decision reviewed. More information is provided inPart 10.


The Registrar is not obliged to amend an assessment to correct an error or mistake. See11.3for further information about the error correction process.


## Adding a relevant dependent child


If a parent advises the Registrar of a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) (4.1.5) that is not taken into account in their child support assessment, the Registrar will amend the assessment to recognise the cost to the parent in caring for that child. The date the amendment takes effect will depend upon the date the Registrar was notified, or otherwise became aware of the relevant dependent child (CSA Act section 73A).


The Registrar does not need an application from a parent before a relevant dependent child can be added to the assessment. The Registrar can become aware of the need to add a relevant dependent in other ways, for example, from information provided by the Secretary or by a parent's authorised representative.


If the Registrar becomes aware of the child within 28 days of that child becoming a relevant dependent child (for example, the date the child was born, or came to live with the parent), or 90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSA Act section 73A(2)) the Registrar can amend the assessment from the date the child became a relevant dependent child (CSA Act section 73A(1)(c)).


Example:Kai and Mali have been assessed in respect of the costs of their 2 children. Kai rings Services Australia on 26 August 2022 to advise that a new child, Zara, has been born to Kai and his current partner (1.1.P.20), Sheree. Zara was born on 8 August 2022. Kai and Mali's assessment is amended from 8 August 2022, the date Zara became a relevant dependent child.


If the Registrar becomes aware of the child within 28 days of sending the parent an assessment notice (1.1.A.120) when an application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) is accepted (or 90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction - CSA Act section 73A(2)), then the Registrar can amend that assessment from the date the application was made (CSA Act section 73A(1)(d)).


Example:An application for an administrative assessment for 2 children is made by Joe on 20 August 2022. A notice advising that the application has been accepted is sent to the other parent, Sadie, on 4 September 2022. Sadie rings Services Australia on 23 September 2022 to advise that she and her partner, Jason have a 4-year old child, Millie. The assessment is amended to show that Sadie has a relevant dependent child from 20 August 2022, the date the application was made.


Otherwise, the assessment will be amended from the date the Registrar was notified or became aware the parent has a relevant dependent child (CSA Act section 73A(1)(e)).


Example:Claire and Lindsay have been assessed in respect of the costs of their 2 children, with the current CSP being from 14 September 2021 to 13 December 2022. Claire rings Services Australia on 12 November 2021 to advise that her child Jan, a natural child of Claire, has been in Claire's care (1.1.C.10) since April 2021. The assessment is amended from 12 November 2021, the date of notification.


## Giving effect to terminating events or changes in circumstances


If the Registrar is notified, or becomes aware of:

• a terminating event (CSA Act section 12), or
• an event which affects the annual rate of child support payable

the Registrar will immediately take into account a terminating event (2.6.3) or change of circumstances that affects the rate of child support payable (CSA Act section 74).


The Registrar will amend an assessment from the date of effect for a child ceasing to be a relevant dependent child (CSA Act section 5(1) 'relevant dependent child'). If this results from a change in care, the date of effect is the same as the date of effect for the new care percentage (1.1.C.20) determinations (4.1.5), as the definition of 'relevant dependent child' is affected by the meaning of 'shared care' (1.1.S.40) and 'percentage of care' (CSA Act sections 5(1) and 5(3)).


See2.6.1for information about when parents reconcile and the child support liability is suspended.

# 2.5.1 How an assessment is made


## Context


This section explains the rules the Registrar must follow when making a child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, section 31, section 66D, section 67, section 68, section 70, section 71, section 72, section 73

## Making an assessment


The Registrar must make a child support assessment when an application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) is accepted. TheCSP(1.1.C.150) starts on the day the application is made (unless the payer (1.1.P.40) is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.90) in which case special criteria may apply (2.1.1)) (CSA Act section 31(1)(b) and CSA Regs section 23).


The Registrar makes a new assessment of child support whenever a new CSP starts.


When making an assessment, the Registrar may act solely on the basis of documents and information in its possession. There is no requirement for the Registrar to conduct any further inquiries or investigations, or to seek any further information or documents (CSA Act section 66D).


## Child support assessments for 2 or more children of the same parents


Where parents (1.1.P.10) are assessed for child support (1.1.C.60) for more than one of their children, the Registrar will make assessments for the children taking into account all the assessed children (CSA Act section 67). The assessments together form a single child support case (1.1.C.80). This applies even when both parents are eligible carers (1.1.E.10) for one or more of their children, or one or more of the children live with a non-parent carer.


Example:Marcus and Delphine have 3 children, Aaron, Toni, and Theo. Aaron lives with Marcus and Toni lives with Delphine. Theo lives with a non-parent carer who has applied for Marcus and Delphine to be assessed in respect of Theo's costs. When working out the child support assessments for the children, the costs of 3 children (as set out in theCOTC(1.1.C.210) table (2.3.1)) are divided by 3 for each child, not the cost of a single child for each child.


This only applies to the children of any 2 parents. When a parent is assessed for child support for children from more than one relationship, there is one child support case for the children from each relationship (CSA Act section 67).


## Assessment to relate to whole or part of a single CSP


A child support assessment must relate to all or some of the days of a single CSP. An assessment cannot relate to more than one CSP (CSA Act section 68). The Registrar may issue a single notice of assessment (assessment notice (1.1.A.120)) that deals with more than one assessment, as long as those assessments relate to a single CSP.


## Assessments for part periods


A CSP cannot exceed 15 months. The Registrar can make an assessment for a period that is less than 15 months (a part period) (CSA Act section 71). This allows assessments to be made where a change in circumstances results in a CSP of less than 15 months.


## Validity of assessments


An assessment is still valid even if the Registrar fails to comply with any of the provisions of the CSA Act (CSA Act section 72).


Example:The Registrar fails to advise a parent that they have been assessed to pay child support. The assessment is still valid. It can only be challenged using the provisions set out in the CSA Act and CSRC Act.


In anART(1.1.A.40) review or a court appeal under Part 7 of the ARTAct, the validity of an assessment may be affected because the provisions of the CSA Act have not been complied with (10.3and10.4).


## Assumptions as to future events


When making an assessment, the Registrar can assume the facts known at the time of making the assessment will remain unchanged (CSA Act section 73). This allows the Registrar to assume certain facts (for example, the care (1.1.C.10) arrangements for the child/ren) will apply in the future.


## Evidence


An assessment notice, or a document signed by the Registrar appearing to be a copy of an assessment, is treated as prima facie evidence in legal proceedings. The notice or document is evidence that the assessment has been properly made and that the particulars of the assessment are correct (CSA Act section 70(1)), except where a parent applies to the ART for review or makes an appeal to a court about the assessment (CSA Act section 70(1A)). In these exceptions, the notice or document is not considered prima facie evidence that all the particulars of the notice of assessment are correct (10.3and10.4).

# 2.5.3 Extending child support assessments past a child's 18th birthday


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) (or non-parent carer) entitled to child support (1.1.C.60) for a child who is turning 18 can apply to extend a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) (including one based on an agreement) provided the child will be in full-time secondary education (1.1.F.30) on their 18th birthday.


The child support assessment can be extended until the last day of the secondary school (1.1.S.10) year in which a child turns 18, as long as the child’s 18th birthday is during the calendar year in which they will be undertaking full-time secondary education. In this section, this is referred to as a CSA Act section 151B application.


A parent entitled to child support is not able to apply for an age 18 extension in respect of a child who turns 18 after the conclusion of a secondary school year and before the commencement of the next calendar year.


A parent who has a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) who is turning 18 can apply to have that child taken into account in any relevant administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) provided the relevant dependent child will be in full-time secondary education on their 18th birthday. The relevant dependent child can be taken into account in any relevant administrative assessment until the last day of the secondary school year consistent with that described for child support children turning 18.


Note:FTBpayments may be affected (reduced) if a parent does not apply for an extension of child support for a child who is turning 18 years and is in full-time secondary education (or an exemption from the FTB Part A maintenance action test). Further information regarding entitlement to FTB is available in FA Guide3.1.5.40.

## Applying for a child support assessment to continue beyond a child’s 18th birthday


A parent entitled to child support can apply to extend a child support assessment, including an assessment modified by an agreement, until the last day of the school year in which the child turns 18 provided the child will be in full-time secondary education on their 18th birthday (CSA Act section 151B).


### How to make an application to continue child support beyond a child’s 18th birthday


A CSA Act section 151B application (made orally or in writing) should include:

• the name of the child
• the name of the school or college
• whether the child will be in full-time secondary education on their 18th birthday
• the last day of secondary school for the calendar year in which the child turns 18, and
• if the application relates to a child support agreement that initiated the assessment under CSA Act section 93, the application must be in writing and signed by both parents.

The section 151B application can be made after the child turns 17 (CSA Act section 151C(2)(a)) and must be made before the child's 18th birthday. If in the Registrar's opinion, there areexceptional circumstancesjustifying the making of the application after the child's 18th birthday, the Registrar may accept an age 18 extension application after the child’s 18th birthday (section 151C(2)(e)(ii)).


Unless the application relates to a child support agreement that initiated the assessment (CSA Act section 93) the extension application does not need to be signed by both parties for it to be accepted.


### Continuing a child support application beyond a child’s 18th birthday when there is an agreement


If, on the day before the child's 18th birthday, the child support assessment is or will be based on a child support agreement that initiated the assessment (child support was not already payable) (CSA Act section 93), and the agreement:

• does not specify an end date (that is, more specific than the usual terminating events), both parties must sign the application for extension for the application to be accepted and to continue the child support agreement beyond the child's 18th birthday (CSA Act section 151B(2)(b)). If both signatures are not received, the assessment cannot be extended, and child support will cease to be payable when the child turns 18 or an earlier terminating event occurs (section 93(1)(h)).
• does specify an end date (CSA Act section 84(1)(g)), the agreement will end on that end date (or an earlier terminating event) and cannot be extended using a section 151B application. A section 151B application cannot override the specified end date in the agreement. To avoid such an agreement ending before or on a child's 18th birthday, the parties would need to make a new child support agreement before the child turns 18. If an agreement has ended before the child's 18th birthday, either parent or a non-parent carer may apply for an administrative assessment or acceptance of an agreement prior to the child's 18th birthday. Once a new assessment is in place after an application from either parent or a non-parent carer, the carer entitled to child support may make an application to extend the assessment beyond the child’s 18th birthday

Where an agreement specifies an end date that is after the child's 18th birthday, a section 151B application signed by both parties could extend the agreement beyond the child's 18th birthday, but only until the earlier of the agreement end date or the last day of the secondary school year. Without a duly signed application for extension, the agreement would end on the child's 18th birthday (a terminating event).


If the assessment for the child is based on an agreement that commenced when child support was already payable (CSA Act section 34B), then the parent entitled to child support may apply for an extension. The section 151B application does not need to be signed by the other parent for it to be accepted. If the agreement does not specify an end date (that is, more specific than the usual terminating events), the agreement will continue to modify the assessment after the child turns 18. If the agreement specifies an end date (section 84(1)(g)), and the section 151B application has been accepted, the agreement will cease to modify the assessment after the end date, and the assessment will instead be based on the formula.


A parent of a relevant dependent child can apply to have the relevant dependent child included in the calculation of any relevant child support assessment until the last day of the school year in which the relevant dependent child turns 18 (section 151B(1A)).


Example:A child support agreement that modifies an existing administrative assessment is to continue until 30 June 2025. The child, Bron, turns 18 on 11 July 2025. The agreement cannot continue beyond Bron’s 18th birthday because the agreement will not be in force on the day before Bron turns 18. However, there will be a formula assessment (1.1.F.20) in place after the agreement ends and an application for continuation of that assessment can be made before the child turns 18.


Example:An application from the parent entitled to child support to continue an assessment for child Adam is accepted. The carer entitled to child support and Adam's other parent then enter into a child support agreement before Adam turns 18. There is no end date in the agreement. The agreement continues after Adam turns 18 because the parents were making an agreement to alter an assessment that continues until the end of the school year.


Example:An agreement modifies a pre-existing administrative assessment for the child, Benson. However, it is not clear whether the parents intended for it to continue beyond Benson's 18th birthday. The parent entitled to child support can apply to extend the assessment without the other parent's consent. The Registrar can continue the agreement beyond Benson's 18th birthday because the agreement did not end when he turned 18 so it will continue to affect the assessment beyond the child's 18th birthday.


Example:The Registrar accepts an application to continue a child support agreement that initiated the assessment under section 93 for child support for Annabel. However, after this application was accepted, Annabel's parents then enter into a new agreement before Annabel turns 18, which terminates the previous agreement. Therefore, the assessment will not continue after Annabel turns 18, unless both parents sign a new application to extend the agreement beyond the child's 18th birthday.


Example:A child support agreement that initiated the assessment under section 93 states that child support will be payable at a given rate until Rica's 18th birthday or until Rica finishes year 12, whichever is the later. An application from the parent receiving child support to extend the assessment cannot be accepted without the other parent's signature, despite what the agreement says. In this case, a terminating event - the child's 18th birthday - will occur before the agreement end date, so it would be necessary for both parents to sign an application to extend the agreement beyond the child's 18th birthday. If the requirement for joint signatures in paragraph 151B(2)(b) is not met, the Registrar cannot accept the application to extend the agreement beyond the child's 18th birthday.


Example:An application to continue the recognition of a relevant dependent child, Roxy, after Roxy's 18th birthday is granted. Any assessment where the parent is assessed in respect of other children continues to recognise that Roxy is a relevant dependent child of the parent.


### When does the extension to the assessment end?


If the application is for a child of the assessment and the Registrar has accepted the application, the child turning 18 does not constitute a terminating event (CSA Act section 151D(1)). Instead:

• a terminating event will happen onthe last day of the secondary school year, orif the child does not complete the school year, the day the Registrar is satisfied the child ceases to be in full-time secondary education
• the last day of the secondary school year, or
• if the child does not complete the school year, the day the Registrar is satisfied the child ceases to be in full-time secondary education
• the child is taken to be aged 17 for the purposes of applying Part 5 of the CSA Act until a terminating event happens (section 151D(2A)).

If the application is for a relevant dependent child:

• the Registrar must amend the assessment to take into account the relevant dependent child until the last day of the school year (CSA Act section 151E(1)), and
• the child is taken to be aged 17 for the purposes of applying Part 5 of the CSA Act (section 151E(2)) for the periodbeginning on the child's 18th birthday, andending on the last day of the secondary school year.
• beginning on the child's 18th birthday, and
• ending on the last day of the secondary school year.

Where an administrative assessment continues after a child turns 18, the provisions of the CSA Act continue to apply, such as to allow the parents to lodge an income estimate (1.1.I.20) (3.4), notify of a change in care arrangement (4.1.5), and apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) (Part 5) (CSA Act Part 6A), in the same way as before the child turned 18.


## How the Registrar will make a decision


The Registrar must accept the application (CSA Act section 151C) if satisfied that:

• the child has turned 17
• an assessment or agreement is in force (or is likely to be in force) on the day before the child turns 18, or an administrative assessment that takes the child into account is in force (or is likely to be in force) on the day before the child turns 18, or a suspension determination (CSA Act section 150F) provides that child support is not payable in respect of the day before the child turns 18
• the child is likely to be in full-time secondary education on their 18th birthday
• the child's 18th birthday will occur on or before the last day of the secondary school year, and
• the application was made before the child's 18th birthday (or there are, in the Registrar's opinion, exceptional circumstances justifying the making of an application after the child's 18th birthday).

## Full-time secondary education


'Full-time secondary education' means education that is determined by the secondary school at which the child is receiving the education to be full-time secondary education (CSA Act section 5).


A child will be considered to be in 'full-time secondary education' during any period that is prescribed by the school to be a term, semester or school holiday break.


'Secondary school' means a school, TAFE college, or any other educational institution, which provides full-time secondary education (section 5). A secondary school also includes a school that caters for the needs of children with learning difficulties and provides a form of education that is not tertiary education.


Example:Alexa has an intellectual disability and attends a school that specifically caters for children with special learning needs. While the curriculum for Alexa's school is different from the curriculum for a child attending a non-special needs secondary school, Alexa's school is still regarded as providing a secondary education.


Example:Martin is studying towards the Higher School Certificate in NSW. Martin's 18th birthday falls in the holiday period between school terms 3 and 4. Martin’s child support assessment can be extended to the end of the secondary school year in the calendar year in which Martin turns 18.


A child may receive a full-time secondary education through distance or online learning provided by a secondary school. Also, a child being home schooled may, in certain circumstances and subject to the relevant state legislation, be in 'full-time secondary education'.


## Secondary school years


The commencement of a secondary school year is not confined by reference to the school terms. Rather, secondary school year relates to a year of study within a particular calendar year.


Example:Sergei completed year 11 in 2023. Sergei is turning 18 on 6 January 2024. Sergei’s school commences classes on 28 January 2024. The last day of Sergei’s 2024 secondary school year is 14 November 2024. The child support assessment for Sergei can continue until 14 November 2024.


Example:Ludwig is in full-time secondary education and is turning 18 on 3 September 2024. The assessment can be extended for Ludwig until the end of the 2024 secondary school year.


Some secondary schools, particularly those in the northern hemisphere, have a school year that spans 2 calendar years (for example, August to May). The Registrar can only continue a child support assessment for a child attending these schools up to the last day of secondary school in the calendar year in which the child turned 18.


Example:Trevor attends Jameson School in year 11. The school year for Jameson School begins in August and ends in May. Trevor begins classes for year 11 in August 2023, and turns 18 on 1 September 2023. The assessment can continue until the last day of the secondary school year (the later of the last day of classes or the end of the examination period) in the 2023 calendar year. Trevor’s assessment cannot continue into the 2024 calendar year.


Example:Astrid lives in the UK where the school year ends in June. Astrid turned 18 in March 2023, while in her second-last year of secondary education. Astrid will continue her secondary education after the end of the 2022-23 school year and will finish her secondary education in June 2024. The last day of classes in the 2023 calendar year is 10 December 2023.


As Astrid turned 18 during the 2023 calendar year, the assessment can be extended until the last day of secondary school in the 2023 calendar year (10 December 2023). The assessment for Astrid cannot continue into the 2024 calendar year.


In some secondary schools, the school year may fall within a calendar year, however, the year level for some students may span 2 calendar years. In cases where the child is required to sit an examination, the last day of the secondary school year (CSA Act section 5) will be the later of the last day of classes for the school year or the last day of exams in the calendar year in which the child turned 18.


## Last day of secondary school for the year


A secondary school year relates to a year of study within a particular calendar year. The Registrar can continue a child support assessment for a child up to the last day of the school year in the calendar year in which the child turns 18. The last day of the secondary school year is either:

• if the child is not required to sit an examination, the last day of classes for the calendar year (as determined by the school), or
• if the child is required to sit an examination in the calendar year, the later of the last day ofthe period of examinations for the child's year level, orclasses for the calendar year (as determined by the school (CSA Act section 5)).
• the period of examinations for the child's year level, or
• classes for the calendar year (as determined by the school (CSA Act section 5)).

Example:Ariel turns 18 in term 1 of year 12. Ariel attends Smithfield School in year 12 and is required to sit exams at the end of year 12. The last day of classes for year 12 at Smithfield School is 15 November and the last day of the exam period for year 12 at Smithfield School is 10 December. The assessment can continue until 10 December.


Example:Fred attends Campbell School in year 11. The last day of school for year 11 is 10 December 2019. Fred turns 18 in November 2019. Although Fred will return to school in 2020 to complete year 12, the assessment can only continue up to the last day of school in year 11 (that is, 10 December 2019) as this is the school year in which Fred turned 18. The assessment cannot continue to the last day of year 12 in 2020 because Fred turned 18 during the year 11 school year in 2019, not the year 12 school year in 2020, and the assessment can only be extended once.


## Repeating a school year


If a child repeats a year of secondary education, the Registrar can continue a child support assessment for the child up to the last day of the repeated secondary school year if the child turns 18 during that school year.


Example:Cornelius completes year 12 in 2023. In order to improve their academic results, Cornelius again enrols in year 12 in 2024.The 2024 school year ends in November 2024 Cornelius turns 18 in March 2024. The assessment can continue until the end of the school year in which Cornelius turns 18, that is November 2024.


## Consideration of late applications


The Registrar can accept an application made after the child's 18th birthday if, in the Registrar's opinion, there are exceptional circumstances justifying the making of the application after the child's 18th birthday (CSA Act section 151C(2)(e)(ii)). The following are examples of circumstances the Registrar may consider 'exceptional' in deciding whether to accept a late application. This is not an exhaustive list and each case must be considered on its own merits.

• Serious health problems delayed lodgement (written confirmation from a health practitioner will be required).
• An application for an assessment has been made but not accepted before the child turns 18, and it was unclear whether the child would be in secondary full-time education.
• The parent was under pressure not to apply (evidence from a person fully aware of the nature and details of the circumstances, for example, a social worker or police officer, will be required).
• Severe distress or hardship (for example, caused by a disaster such as fire or flood) delayed lodgement.
• Communication difficulties led to an inability to access information (a result of geographical location, cultural issues, literacy, language difficulties, etc.).

The exceptional circumstances must relate to the reasons that justify the making of the application after the child's 18th birthday and not to the consequences to the individual of making a late application.


Example:Natasha did not make an application to extend the child support assessment prior to child Silvan's 18th birthday. After the child support assessment has ended, Natasha realises that their FTB has been affected and asks the Registrar to consider a late application. The Registrar would refuse the application if there were no exceptional circumstances that justified the application being made after Silvan turned 18.


## Notification of & review rights of the decision


If the Registrar refuses an application to extend a child support assessment, the parent who made the application must be advised in writing (CSA Act section 151C(3)). The parents or non-parent carer can object to the particulars of the assessment.


If the Registrar accepts the application:

• both the parent who made the application and the parent liable to pay child support must be advised in writing (section 151C(4)), and
• both parties must be advised that, if aggrieved by the decision, they may object to the particulars of the assessment (section 151C(5)).

## Suspension determination


An application made for a child support assessment to continue beyond a child's 18th birthday must be accepted by the Registrar if, among other things, the Registrar is satisfied that a suspension determination under CSA Act section 150F provides that child support is not payable in respect of the day before the child turns 18 (CSA Act section 151C(2)(b)(ia)). However, there must be a parent entitled to child support at the time the Registrar is making the decision whether to accept an application for a child support assessment to continue beyond a child's 18th birthday. This means:

• where an application has been made by the parent entitled to child support, and a suspension period has not commenced, a decision could still be made by the Registrar to accept the application for the assessment to continue beyond a child's 18th birthday
• where an application has been made on a day and a suspension period is later determined to apply on that day, and the Registrar has not yet made a decision on the application, the Registrar cannot accept the application for a child support assessment to continue beyond a child's 18th birthday as there was no parent entitled to child support on that day.

See2.6.4for information on suspension determinations.


## Other options if assessment is not extended


### Change of assessment


If an administrative assessment for a child is not extended past the child's 18th birthday, either parent may make an application to change the assessment where, in the special circumstances of the case, their capacity to support the other child/ren of the assessment is significantly reduced by their duty to maintain the adult child over 18 years of age (5.2.10).


### Adult child maintenance orders


A court with family law jurisdiction will hear applications for child maintenance from parents or non-parent carers who are not eligible for a child support assessment. This includes an order for further maintenance of a child over the age of 18 if this is necessary to enable the child to complete their education or because the child has a physical or mental disability. If a court has ordered the payer (1.1.P.40) to pay child support for a child over 18 it will not be necessary to apply for the assessment for that child to continue (see9.1.1for more information about child maintenance orders including whether the orders can be registered with the Registrar for collection).

# 2.5.5 Implementing court orders that vary assessments


## Context


Courts can make a range of orders on direct application which affect a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and can make other orders affecting a child support case (1.1.C.80) including stay orders (1.1.S.70). For more information about the types of orders the court can make, see10.4.2.


When the Registrar is notified of a court order made under the child support (1.1.C.60) legislation, the Registrar must take action that is necessary to amend the child support assessment to give effect to the order.


This section explains how the Registrar gives effect to specific kinds of court orders.


Note:A parent (1.1.P.10) may also apply directly to a court if they are dissatisfied with certain decisions made by the Registrar under the CSA Act. However, for most decisions it is necessary for the Registrar to have dealt with an objection (1.1.O.10) about the decision and for theART(1.1.A.40) to have undertaken a review of the objection decision before the parent can make their court application. In those cases, the parent can only appeal to a court if they think that there has been an error of law. See10.2for further information about objections,10.3for further information about external review at the ART and10.4.6for further information about appeals to court.

## Implementation of court orders


When a court's decision under the child support legislation becomes final, the Registrar must take action that is necessary to amend the child support assessment to give effect to the order. However, the Registrar may, and generally will, give effect to a court order as soon as possible after being notified of the provisions of the court order, without waiting for the order to become final. If the order is changed following an appeal, the Registrar will amend the child support assessment again to reflect the terms of the later order.


Note:An order made by consent of the parties is an order of a court, and not a child support agreement.


## When court orders become final


An order of a single Judge or Magistrate becomes final at the end of the period allowed by the court rules for an appeal to a higher court. This is usually 28 days. An order of the full bench of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) will become final 30 days after it is made unless an application is made to the High Court for special leave to appeal.


This section explains how the Registrar gives effect to specific kinds of court orders, including:

• orders for a periodic amount
• orders for a nil assessment
• orders to reduce arrears
• orders varying, setting aside or nullifying an earlier order
• orders the Registrar cannot implement
• severability of clauses

The section also discusses:

• end dates of orders to change the assessment
• the effect of an agreement on an order to change the assessment
• the effect of a terminating event on an order to change the assessment
• orders setting a rate of child support for more than one child
• unemployment clauses
• self-supporting children
• children in full-time education

### Orders for a periodic amount (1.1.P.80)


An order may say that a parent must pay a periodic amount but not state whether the order is made under the CSA Act or if it is an order for a change to the assessment. The Registrar will interpret such orders as orders to change the assessment unless there is an indication to the contrary. If there is a heading on the order that suggests it is made under the provisions of the FL Act, Services Australia should obtain a copy of the application to check whether the applicant applied for a departure order.


The Registrar will generally accept that the court has acted correctly in making the order, unless there is a further court order that has set aside the order or a finding by a court that the order was made without power.


### Orders reducing the assessment to nil


The Registrar cannot make a change of assessment decision that has the effect of reducing the annual rate of child support below theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support if the liable parent (1.1.L.30) has less than regular care (1.1.R.50) of the children (CSA Act section 98SA). However, a court may make such orders, and the Registrar will give effect to them (CSA Act sections 118, 119, 66(8)(a)).


### An order to reduce arrears under the CSA Act


A departure order or child support agreement may purport to discharge arrears (1.1.A.100) where an assessment has been made under the CSA Act. The child support legislation does not expressly provide for arrears to be discharged, but the Registrar will give effect to these orders and agreements where possible by varying the rate of child support for a specified period. To avoid any uncertainty, a departure order or agreement that seeks to discharge arrears should set the rate of child support for the period at a rate equal to the amount of child support that has already been paid for that period. This will have the effect of removing the accrued child support arrears.


### Orders varying, setting aside or nullifying a particular order


The CSA Act does not provide for a parent to apply to have a previous court order varied or set aside. However, the same effect can be obtained by applying to a court for a departure from the assessment. If a court makes such an order, the Registrar will interpret it to be an order to change the child support assessment and will make appropriate amendments to the assessment.


If a court makes an order that nullifies an earlier order, this means that the earlier order should not have been made and has no legal effect. The Registrar will amend the assessment as if the earlier order had not been made.


### Orders the Registrar cannot implement


If the Registrar cannot give effect to an order, the parents and, if appropriate, their legal representatives must be advised. They must also be advised that they have the right to object (10.2) under Part VII of the CSRC Act if they consider that the particulars of their assessment are incorrect because the Registrar did not give effect to the order.


### Severability of clauses in an order


A child support agreement or court order that contains clauses that can be accepted or registered under the child support legislation, may also contain clauses that cannot be accepted or registered under the legislation. The clauses that could usually be accepted or registered, cannot be if doing so without accepting or registering the other clauses would change their meaning or change the essential nature of the agreement or order. Such clauses are said to be 'not severable' from the other clauses and the application for acceptance or registration of the entire agreement or order must be refused.


The Registrar will advise both parents if there are clauses that cannot be accepted or registered and discuss alternative options.


### End dates of orders to change the assessment


An order changing the assessment has effect until:

• a terminating event (2.6.3) occurs (CSA Act section 142)
• a further departure order is made, or
• the end date or occurrence of an event specified in the order has occurred.

### Effect of a child support agreement on an order to change the assessment


When the Registrar accepts a child support agreement that includes provisions:

• for one party to pay periodic child support to another
• varying the rate at which periodic child support is already payable, or
• agreeing any other matter that can be included in an order made by the Court under Division 4 Part 7 of the CSA Act

the agreement has the same effect as a new court order and can replace or otherwise affect an existing court order (CSA Act section 95(2)).


### Terminating events & departure orders


A terminating event (2.6.3) may happen in relation to all or some of the children covered by the assessment subject to a court order that changes the assessment. The order ceases to be in force as of the date of the terminating event (CSA Act section 142, CSRC Act section 111H). The order will remain in force for any child not affected by the terminating event.


If a parent reapplies for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) after a terminating event (for example, because a child who had left their care (1.1.C.10) later returns to their care), the Registrar will use the formula and not the departure order when a new assessment is made for the child for whom the assessment ended.


Where a departure order is in force that covers only some of the children of the relationship, or where the order has ceased to be in force for some of the children, the Registrar will make a 'mixed assessment'. Some of the children will be assessed in accordance with the departure order and others in accordance with the child support formula (1.1.C.110), as appropriate.


### Setting a rate of child support for more than one child


A court order or agreement that sets a rate of child support for more than one child should ideally state how much is payable for each of the children. In the absence of such a statement, the Registrar cannot apportion the amount between the children. When the court order or agreement ends in relation to one or more of the children and the order does not specify an amount for each child, the Register will continue to reflect the full amount payable under that order or agreement.


Example:An order states that $100 per week each for the 2 children of the marriage is payable making a total of $200 per week. The eldest child reaches 18 years of age and the liability is reduced to $100 per week.


Example:An order states that $200 per week is payable for the children of the marriage. There are 2 children and when the eldest reaches 18 years, $200 will remain payable as it is not clear how the total amount was to be apportioned between them.


### Unemployment clauses


Court orders and child support agreements can suspend or reduce the liability when a parent is unemployed. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will take the following issues into account when interpreting the court order.


For the liability to be varied when a parent becomes unemployed, the Registrar must be able to determine the person's employment status. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Registrar will accept that a parent is unemployed if they receive an income tested benefit or pension. Where the parent does not receive a benefit or pension, the Registrar will consider statements made by the parent and documentary evidence such as an employment separation certificate.


Many court orders and child support agreements allow for a reduced liability during periods when a parent is in receipt of 'unemployment benefits'. A difficulty arises when a parent is not employed but is not receiving an unemployment benefit, or is receiving another type of benefit. A broad interpretation will be given to the term 'unemployment benefits'. The Registrar may apply such a clause where the person is receiving an income tested benefit or pension as a result of not being in employment (for example, disability support pension). However, a parent is still employed if they are receiving benefits but their employment has not been terminated.


A parent may be unable to work because of a work-related injury and receive periodic compensation payments. The Registrar will determine if the parent is still employed by their employer. If the employment contract has been terminated, the Registrar will accept that the person is unemployed despite being in receipt of payments that may be greater than those payable to unemployed welfare beneficiaries.


A court can make an order that varies a parent's liability in a current period of unemployment, or one that applies during any period of unemployment.


Example:An order states that the amount payable is to be reduced to $10 per week during periods when Kylie is not in full-time employment. This applies whenever Kylie is not in full-time employment after the date of the order.


### Self-supporting children


Court orders and child support agreements sometimes contain a provision providing for a reduction in child support payable if the child is self-supporting. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will interpret the clause in the following way.


The Registrar must be satisfied that the child is self-supporting. The Registrar will not consider whether or not the child is capable of being self-supporting or should be self-supporting.


In determining whether a child is self-supporting, the Registrar will determine the child's actual income and whether the child is paying for their basic living expenses without financial support from another person. Basic living expenses include accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs. The Registrar will disregard any entitlement of the child to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit. If the child is also making lifestyle choices that would not be available without an independent source of income (for example, buying a car), the child is more likely to be self-supporting.


If the child is living away from home, the Registrar will consider whether the payee (1.1.P.30) continues to have care and control of the child or whether the child is living independently from the payee and meeting their own costs. The Registrar will consider whether there has been a terminating event.


If the child continues to live with the payee, they will be self-supporting if they pay a reasonable contribution towards household expenses including accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs, or if they pay board equal to this amount to the payee. If the child is living with the payee but is not contributing towards those household expenses, or is only making a nominal contribution, the Registrar will find that the child is not self-supporting.


The Registrar will not attempt to obtain this information from a child under the age of 18 years and will request evidence from the parents in order to make a decision.


### Children in full-time education


Court orders and child support agreements sometimes state that they are to operate until a child ceases to be in full-time education or until they finish a particular level of education such as secondary schooling. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will consider the following issues when interpreting the clause.


Some institutions such as TAFE offer a range of courses from secondary education to vocational training and higher education courses. Tertiary education involves a distinct qualification, a certificate, diploma or degree, rather than matriculation or vocational training. The Registrar will ask for evidence from the payee about the child's student status. If the child is still at secondary school (1.1.S.10), the Registrar will find that the child is in full-time education.


If the child has finished secondary school and is studying at an institution that considers the child as a full-time student, the Registrar will generally accept that the child is in full-time education. See9.3.4.60for more information.

## Types of terminating events


The various 'terminating events' are listed below.


### Child terminating event


A terminating event happens if the child of the child support assessment (CSA Act section 12(1)) meets the following conditions:

• dies
• ceases to be an eligible child (2.1.2) because the child is in the care (1.1.C.10) of a person under a child welfare law (CSA Act section 22 and CSA Regs section 6)
• turns 18 (unless the Registrar has accepted an application for the assessment to continue beyond a child's 18th birthday (2.5.3))
• is adopted
• becomes a member of a couple (1.1.M.10)
• is no longer present in Australia, is not an Australian citizen, and is not ordinarily resident in Australia (1.6.2) (and is not subject to aninternational maintenance arrangement), or
• a second liability is registered for the same parents (1.1.P.10) and child/ren (CSRC Act section 30AA(1)).

### Eligible carer terminating event


A terminating event happens if a parent or non-parent carer entitled to receive child support dies (CSA Act section 12(2)).


### Terminating event in relation to a child


A terminating event happens in relation to a child (CSA Act section 12(2AA)) if:

• both parents of the child are not eligible carers (1.1.E.10) of the child (2.1.1), that is, they are determined as not having at least 35% care of the child after a change in care (CSA Act section 12(2AA)(a)), and
• there is no non-parent carer entitled to be paid child support in relation to the child (that is, no non-parent carer is entitled to child support for the child under the child support assessment) (CSA Act section 12(2AA)(b)), and
• paragraphs (a) and (b) are met becauseall persons who were eligible carers of the child ceased to be eligible carers of the child, anda parent who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer of the child but for CSA Act section 54F(3)(b)(i)
• all persons who were eligible carers of the child ceased to be eligible carers of the child, and
• a parent who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer of the child but for CSA Act section 54F(3)(b)(i)

and the Registrar or Secretary is notified or otherwise becomes aware of the change of care more than 26 weeks after the relevant change of care day (CSA Act section 12(2AA)(c)).


This means a terminating event occurs if the Registrar makes new care percentage (1.1.C.20) determinations after a change in care, neither parent of the child has at least 35% care of the child as a result of the new care percentage determinations, and there is no non-parent carer entitled to child support for the child under the child support assessment. The date of effect for the terminating event is the date of effect for the new care percentage determinations (4.1.5).


A terminating event also occurs where all persons who had at least 35% care of the child have ceased to be eligible carers of the child, and a parent who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer of the child, but for the Registrar or Secretary being notified or otherwise becoming aware of that matter more than 26 weeks after the relevant change of care. Therefore, where notification of the change of care event has been delayed and occurs after the 26-week time limit, a terminating event would occur with effect from the change of care day. A suspension determination applies in these circumstances where notification of the event occurs within 26 weeks (2.6.4).


Where a child changes care and a parent or non-parent carer continues to provide at least 35% care, a terminating event does not occur and the assessment continues. However, the Registrar may need to amend the assessment (2.5.4).


If a child moves into the full-time care of a non-parent carer who is not entitled to be paid child support for the child under the child support assessment, a terminating event occurs regardless of whether the non-parent carer subsequently applies for a child support assessment.


Example:Arnold and Paula have been assessed in respect of the costs of their child Felicity, and Arnold has 100% care of Felicity. On 2 July 2024, Felicity moves from Arnold's 100% care to Paula's 100% care. Arnold advised Services Australia of this on 10 January 2025. This is a terminating event as the care change was notified more than 26 weeks after the date of care change, and Arnold ceased to be an eligible carer and Paula would have become an eligible carer if the Registrar had been notified of the change.


Example:Yael and Petru have been assessed in respect of the costs of their child Hilargi, who is in Yael's 60% care and Dianne's 40% care. Dianne is a non-parent carer and is a party to the assessment. On 3 September 2024, Hilargi moved from Yael's 60% care to Dianne's 100% care. Yael advised Services Australia of the care change on 19 October 2024. This is not a terminating event but rather a change in care, as Hilargi is in the care of a party to the assessment. As the care change was notified more than 28 days after the date of care change, Yael's decrease in care will be given effect to starting from 3 September 2024 (date of care change) and Dianne's increase in care will be given effect to starting from 19 October 2024 (the date of notification).


Example:Olga and Patricia have been assessed in respect of the costs of their child Jeff, with Olga and Patricia each having 50% care. Jeff moves to Scarlet's 100% care on 19 August 2024. Scarlet is not a party to the child support assessment. Patricia advises Services Australia of the care change on 29 November 2024, more than 28 days after the event. The new care percentage determinations of 0% for Olga and Patricia take effect from 19 August 2024, the date of the care change. This results in a terminating event, as Olga and Patricia are not eligible carers of Jeff, and Scarlet is not entitled to child support for Jeff under the assessment. The terminating event takes effect from 19 August 2024, the date of effect for the new care percentage determinations.


### Liable parent terminating event


A terminating event happens if a parent liable to pay child support (CSA Act section 12(3)):

• dies, or
• ceases to be a resident of Australia (1.6.1) (1.1.R.100) (and is not subject to aninternational maintenance arrangement).

### Terminating events in respect of an election to end an assessment & an end date of liability specified in a child support agreement


In addition, a terminating event happens on a specified day if (CSA Act section 12(4)):

• a carer entitled to receive child support makes an election to end an assessment under CSA Act section 151(1) (2.6.2) for the child from a specified day
• the liable parent (1.1.L.30), or a carer entitled to receive child support makes an election to end an assessment under CSA Act section 151(1A) (2.6.2) for the child from a specified day, or
• the Registrar has accepted a child support agreement in relation to the child in which the parents and any non-parent carer agreed that the liability to pay child support is to end from a specified day (6.1).

### Reconciliation


A terminating event happens if the parents of the child, to whom the child support assessment relates, reconcile for a period of 6 months or more (CSA Act section 12(5)). This means that they are legally married to each other and are not living separately or apart on a permanent or indefinite basis; or are living together (2.1.1) as partners (1.1.P.20) on a genuine domestic basis although not legally married to each other; or are in a registered relationship and are not living separately or apart on a permanent or indefinite basis. The terminating event occurs 6 months after the parents reconciled, where the parents have remained reconciled on a continuous basis during the 6-month period (2.6.1).


### Terminating events & international maintenance arrangements


If an international maintenance arrangement applies in relation to a case, a terminating event happens when:

• the parent liable to pay child support was a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.6.3) (1.1.R.90) and they cease to be a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction or Australia (CSA Act section 12(3A))
• the reciprocating jurisdiction in which the liable parent resides becomes an excluded jurisdiction (CSA Act section 12(3B))
• the carer entitled to receive child support was a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction and they cease to be a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction or a resident of Australia (CSA Act section 12(2A)), or
• both parents cease to be residents of Australia (CSA Act section 12(4B)).

Note:A child support assessment will not end when the carer ceases to be a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction if the child is an Australian citizen, present in Australia or ordinarily resident in Australia. In that situation, no international maintenance arrangement applies in relation to the case and therefore section 12(2A) does not apply.


A child support assessment will end pursuant to the Australia-New Zealand Child Support Agreement (CSRC RegsSchedule 1) if the carer entitled to receive child support becomes habitually resident of New Zealand. Under the terms of the Agreement, the date from which the assessment will end is either:

• where the carer, the payer (1.1.P.40) or the central authority gives a notice in writing that the carer is habitually resident of New Zealand - the day before the receipt by the Registrar of that written notice (Agreement Article 5, CSA Act section 150DA and CSA Regs section 16), or
• where a New Zealand child support assessment is made in relation to the same parents and child/ren - the day before the start date of the New Zealand assessment (Agreement Article 7, CSA Act section 150DA and CSA Regs section 16).

## Effect of a terminating event


The Registrar must amend or end an assessment to take into account a terminating event (CSA Act section 74). The assessment is amended or ended from the date of effect for the terminating event (CSA Act section 12).

# 2.6.4 Suspension of liability to pay child support when there is a change in eligible carer


## Context


A liability to pay child support (1.1.C.60) can be suspended if there is a delay in Services Australia being notified when the parties in a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) have swapped eligible carer (1.1.E.10) roles.


## Act references

• When the suspension determination takes effect
• Effect of the suspension determination

## Suspension of child support liability when there is a change in eligible carer & notification was delayed


The Registrar must make a suspension determination that child support is not payable for a child by a liable parent (1.1.L.30) to another person if the:

• Registrar, or Secretary, is notified or otherwise becomes aware thatall persons who were eligible carers of the child have ceased to be eligible carers of the child (CSA Act section 150F(1)(a)(i))a parent (1.1.P.10) who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer, but for care date of effect rules (under CSA Act section 54F(3)(b)(i)) (CSA Act section 150F(1)(a)(ii)), and
• all persons who were eligible carers of the child have ceased to be eligible carers of the child (CSA Act section 150F(1)(a)(i))
• a parent (1.1.P.10) who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer, but for care date of effect rules (under CSA Act section 54F(3)(b)(i)) (CSA Act section 150F(1)(a)(ii)), and
• Registrar or Secretary is notified, or otherwise becomes aware, that the parent who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer and this notification occurred more than 28 days after the relevant change of care day, but before the end of 26 weeks after that day (CSA Act section 150F(1)(b)).

If the Registrar makes a suspension determination, child support for the child is not payable by the liable parent to the other person (CSA Act section 150F(2)):

• from the change of care day, and
• until the day before the Registrar, or Secretary, is notified or otherwise becomes aware of a parent who was not an eligible carer of the child would have become an eligible carer of the child but for the care date of effect rules the matter in CSA Act section 150F(1)(a)(ii).

If there is a delay in parties notifying of a change of care (1.1.C.10), there will be some circumstances where all persons are assessed as having a care percentage (1.1.C.20) of less than 35% for a child during the period from the date of the care change until the day before notification of the care change, due to the care percentage date of effect rules (4.1.5) (CSA Act section 150F(1)). Therefore, on the assessment there will be no eligible carer during this period. This can occur when parents swap the eligible carer role for a child - that is, one parent ceases to be an eligible carer at the same time the other parent becomes an eligible carer for the child - and notification of the swap was delayed.


ForFTBpurposes, the actual date of the change in care will be used.


## When the suspension determination takes effect


If the Registrar makes a suspension determination, the child support liability is not payable from the change of care day until the day before the Registrar (or Secretary) is notified or otherwise becomes aware of the change of care day (CSA Act section 150F(2)).


Example:Michael and Fiona have 2 children, Andrea and Bennett. Fiona has 100% care of Andrea and Bennett. Michael advised Services Australia on 25 October 2021 that the care of their children changed on 1 August 2021 and that he now has 100% care of Andrea and Bennett.


The care change notification was delayed and occurred after 28 days but before 26 weeks from the change of care day, and both parents are assessed as having a care percentage of less than 35% for the children, due to care percentage date of effect rules. That is, because Fiona's 0% care of Andrea and Bennett is applied in the assessment from the change of care day (1 August 2021) and Michael's 100% care of Andrea and Bennett is not applied in the assessment until the date of notification of the care change (25 October 2021), the care percentages in the assessment for the period 1 August to 24 August 2021 are 0% care for both Fiona and Michael in relation to both of the children.


Therefore, a suspension determination is made by the Registrar and the child support liability is suspended from 1 August 2021 (change of care day) to 24 October 2021 (the day before the Registrar is notified).


## Effect of the suspension determination


During a suspension determination, the assessment is not in force for the child for the period from the date of event to the day before notification.


A terminating event (under CSA Act section 12(2AA)) would not occur during a suspension determination, as long as there was less than 26 weeks between the care change and notification of the care change. However, care changes (which resulted in no eligible carers on the assessment) that are notified outside of the 26 week time limit will be a terminating event under CSA Act section 12(2AA) (2.6.3).

# 3.1 Child support income


## Introduction


This topic explains how child support income (1.1.C.120) is calculated and when it is used in the child support formula (1.1.C.110).


## Description


Child support income is calculated in Step 1 of the child support formula to determine a parent’s (1.1.P.10) financial capacity to support all their biological or adopted children. A parent's child support income is their:

• ATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20), less
• the self-support amount (1.1.S.20), less
• any relevant dependent child amount (3.1.2) (1.1.R.60), less
• any multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30).

The way child support income is calculated for the relevant dependent child amount and the multi-case allowance within Step 1 is explained below.


A parent's child support income is their:

• ATI, less
• the self-support amount.

A parent's child support income is their:

• ATI, less
• the self-support amount, less
• any relevant dependent child amount.

## Child support income determined in some other way


Other provisions of the Act may also be used to determine a parent's child support income:

• a change of assessment decision (Part 5)
• a child support agreement (Part 6)
• a court order made (10.4.2)
• post-separation income (3.5).

Act reference:CSA ActPart 6A Departure from administrative assessment …, Part 7 Division 4 Orders for departure from administrative assessment …, section 44 Post separation costs


## When is child support income used in the child support formula?


A parent’s child support income is used in Step 2 of the child support formula to calculate combined child support income (1.1.C.190), and in Step 3 to calculate each parent’s income percentage (1.1.I.30).


Combined child support income is used in Step 7 of the child support formula to calculate theCOTC(1.1.C.210) for an assessment.

# 3.1.1 Adjusted taxable income


## Introduction


ATI(1.1.A.20) is a component used to calculate child support income (1.1.C.120).


## On this page

• ATI
• Amounts not included in ATI

## ATI


A parent's (1.1.P.10) ATI is the total of the following components:

• taxable income (1.1.T.20) - including overseas income if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1)
• reportable fringe benefits total (1.1.R.70)
• target foreign income (1.1.T.10)
• the parent's total net investment loss (1.1.T.50)
• the total of the specified tax free pensions or benefits (1.1.T.30), and
• the parent's reportable superannuation contributions (1.1.R.80).

### Which year of income is used?

• ATI based on a tax assessment – the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10)
• ATI based on a provisional income (3.3) (1.1.P.130) – the last relevant year of income
• ATI based on an income estimate (1.1.I.20) (3.4) – the current financial year.

Where the parent is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10), the Registrar can use information about the parent's income in that jurisdiction to determine the parent's overseas income.


Example:Lawson who lives in New Zealand has a newCSP(1.1.C.150) commencing on 1 May 2020. The New Zealand financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March. As Lawson is a New Zealand resident, New Zealand Inland Revenue Child Support advises the Registrar of Lawson's taxable income for the 2019-20 New Zealand financial year. This information can be used to determine Lawson's overseas income for the last relevant year of income.


If an application for post separation income (1.1.P.90) (3.5) to be excluded from a parent's ATI has been accepted then the parent's ATI will be the amount determined by the Registrar.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 43 Working out parent's adjusted taxable income, section 44 Post-separation costs, section 58B Inclusion of overseas income in working out a parent's adjusted taxable income


Policy reference:CS Guide1.5.1Australia's international maintenance arrangements


## Amounts not included in ATI


The following amounts are not considered when calculating a parent's ATI.


### National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) amounts


An NDIS amount (as defined under theNational Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013) is for the purpose of reasonable and necessary supports funded under a participant's plan.


An NDIS amount is exempt from income tax. Accordingly, the amounts are not taxable income and are not included in ATI.


When the Registrar is considering a parent's application for theMAR(1.1.M.20) (2.3.4) to be reduced to nil, or theFAR(1.1.F.10) (2.3.5) to not be used, any income earned, derived or received by the parent must be considered, except certain prescribed payments. An NDIS amount is a prescribed payment, and therefore, NDIS amounts are excluded from the definition of 'income' for these child support (1.1.C.60) decisions.


Act reference:National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013


Income Tax Assessment Act 1997section 52-180 National Disability Insurance Scheme amounts are exempt


CSA Regssection 13 Prescribed payments


CSA Actsection 65B Application for section 65A not to apply, section 66A Registrar may reduce an assessment to nil in certain cases


### National Redress Scheme payments


Payments of redress include a redress payment made to a person under theNational Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018(National Redress Act) and may include a counselling and psychological services payment under section 51 of the National Redress Act.


Payments received under the National Redress Scheme are non-assessable for income tax purposes (Taxation Determination TD 2018/16). Accordingly, the amounts are not taxable income and are not included in ATI.


When the Registrar is considering a parent's application for the MAR to be reduced to nil, or the FAR to not be used, any income earned, derived or received by the parent must be considered, except certain prescribed payments. A redress payment under the National Redress Scheme is a prescribed payment, and therefore, redress payments under the National Redress Scheme are excluded from the definition of 'income' for these child support decisions.


Act reference:National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018section 48 The Operator must pay the redress payment, section 60 Entitlement to redress payment


CSA Regssection 13 Prescribed payments


CSA Actsection 65B Application for section 65A not to apply, section 66A Registrar may reduce an assessment to nil in certain cases


### Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme payments


Payments of redress under the scheme known as the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme are exempt from income tax. Accordingly, Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme payments are not 'taxable income' and are not part of a person's ATI for general child support purposes.


Act reference:Income Tax Assessment Act 1997Part 2-15 section 53-30 Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme payments are exempt

# 3.1.2 Relevant dependent child amount


## Context


The relevant dependent child amount is a component of child support income (1.1.C.120) (3.1), and recognises the financial responsibility of a parent (1.1.P.10) for a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60).


A parent's relevant dependent child amount is the total of the amounts worked out for each relevant dependent child of the parent using the following steps.


Example:In 2023, Sung-soo hasATI(1.1.A.20) of $66,000 and 2 relevant dependent children. Abigail is aged 3 and Suellen is aged 6. She has 100% care of both children.


Note:A parent who lives full-time with a relevant dependent child has 100% care of that child, even if they also live with a new partner (1.1.P.20).


The new partner's income is not included in the calculation of the relevant dependent child amount.

# 3.2 Tax lodgement


## Introduction


Child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are generally based on both parents’ (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20) for the last relevant financial year (1.1.L.10) and the level of care (1.1.C.10) they provide for their children. A parent who receives or pays child support (1.1.C.60) has an annual tax lodgement obligation to ensure their assessment is based on their most up-to-date income.


This chapter explains how parent’s meet their annual tax lodgement obligation, and how an assessment may be updated if the Registrar receives new income information from an amended tax assessment.


Information about how a tax assessment may replace a provisional income (1.1.P.130) is provided at3.3.3.


Information about tax refund intercepts (1.1.T.40) is provided at8.3.1.


## In this chapter


This chapter contains the following sections:

• 3.2.1 Tax lodgement obligations for child support customers
• 3.2.2 Amended tax assessments
• 3.2.3 New information about ATI

# 3.2.1 Tax lodgement obligations for child support customers


## Context


Child support (1.1.C.60) parents (1.1.P.10) must meet their tax lodgement obligations by lodging a tax return, or lodging aRNNadvice with theATO. A RNN advice is also known as lodging a non-lodgement advice.


## On this page

• When is a tax return lodged on time?

## How parents comply with their tax lodgement obligations for a year


### Lodge a tax return


A parent complies with their tax lodgement obligations by lodging a tax return for the relevant year through the ATO.


### Lodge a RNN


A child support parent is not required to lodge a tax return if:

• their taxable income (1.1.T.20) was less than the amount specified by the ATO for that year. The amount specified by the ATO will be equal to or less the self-support amount (1.1.S.20) that applied on 1 January of that relevant financial year, and
• they were in receipt of a specified Australian Government pension, allowance or payment for the whole of the income year.

If a child support parent is not required to lodge a tax return, they must lodge aRNN advicewith the ATO.


## When is a tax return lodged on time?


Services Australia relies on the ATO to determine if a tax return is lodged on time. The date a tax return is due depends if it is lodged by the individual or if it is lodged with a registered tax agent.


### Tax return lodged by individual


A parent preparing and lodging their own tax return needs to lodge it on or before 31 October. More information can be found on theATO’s website.


### Tax return lodged by a registered tax agent


Parents who lodge their tax return through a registered tax agent have different due dates for lodgement. More information about due dates for the ATO tax agent lodgement program can be found on theATO’s website.

# 3.3 Provisional income - determination of ATI


## Context


A key objective of the Child Support Scheme is that parents (1.1.P.10) financially support their children based on their financial capacity. Services Australia uses a parent’s taxable income (1.1.T.20) to determine anATI(1.1.A.20). The ATI is used to determine a parent’s financial capacity to support their children. Formula assessments (1.1.F.20) use ATI for the last relevant financial year (1.1.L.10) as this is the most current income information available.


When a parent has not lodged a tax return for the last relevant financial year, Services Australia may determine a provisional income (1.1.P.130) for them. A provisional income is based on income information available to Services Australia.


The provisional income may be replaced once the parent lodges their tax return. If Services Australia receives updated income information, a provisional income may be replaced with a new provisional income.

# 3.2.2 Amended tax assessments


## Introduction


The Registrar may receive information that a parent's (1.1.P.10) tax assessment has been amended by theATOresulting in a differentATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20). There are rules about when a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) can be amended to reflect this new information.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 56, section 57, section 58, section 58A


## On this page

• Overview
• Higher amended tax assessments
• Lower amended tax assessments
• Original tax assessment was lodged on time
• Original tax assessment was lodged late

## Overview


If the ATO issues an amended assessment of a parent's taxable income (1.1.T.20) for the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10) before the Registrar makes the child support assessment, the Registrar will use the taxable income shown in the amended tax assessment.


Once the Registrar has made a child support assessment based on a parent's taxable income, any subsequent changes to the parent's taxable income may be applied to the child support assessment for the relevantCSP(1.1.C.150). This will be dependent on whether the amended taxable income is higher or lower than the parent's previous taxable income, and the timeliness of the action taken to amend the tax assessment.


## Higher amended tax assessments


Where an amended tax assessment results in an ATI higher than:

• the previous ATI for the same financial year, or
• any income determined by the Registrar under section 58 of the CSA Act (provisional income (3.3) (1.1.P.130))

the child support assessment will be amended retrospectively from the beginning of the relevant CSP, subject to any income amount order (1.1.I.10) in force (section 56(2A)(a) and section 58A(3B)(a)).


Similarly, where a parent's previous tax assessment is nil and an amended tax assessment is received by the Registrar, the amended tax assessment will apply from the beginning of the CSP, subject to any income amount order in force (section 57(7)).


## Lower amended tax assessments


Where an amended tax assessment results in an ATI that is lower than the ATI from the previous tax assessment for the same financial year, the child support assessment will be amended prospectively, for each later day in the relevant CSP, and may also be amended retrospectively if certain criteria are met. The rules are different according to whether:

• a provisional income was determined (3.3) under section 58 of the CSA Act in the absence of a tax assessment
• the parent lodged their original tax assessment on time, and
• the original tax assessment was higher or lower than the provisional income.

## Original tax assessment was lodged on time


For CSPs where the parent's original tax assessment was lodged on time (3.2.1), the child support assessment will be amended from the beginning of the relevant CSP, subject to any income amount order, if any of the following applies (section 56(2A)(b) and (c)):

• The parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within the relevant lodgement timeframe under income tax legislation for that year of income.
• The parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of receiving the previous tax assessment notice.
• The parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of becoming aware of an error in the previous tax assessment and the reason for not taking earlier action to correct the error was due to circumstances beyond the parent's knowledge or control.
• The Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances exist.

Example:The ATO issues a tax assessment for Max of $38,000 that starts a new CSP. The ATO then identifies what it believes to be an error and amends Max's taxable income to $45,000. When the Registrar receives notification of Max's higher taxable income, the higher taxable income of $45,000 replaces his original taxable income of $38,000 from the beginning of the CSP. Max lodges an objection (1.1.O.10) to the amendment with the ATO within 28 days of receiving notice of the amended tax assessment. The ATO allows Max's objection, determines Max's taxable income and issues another amended tax assessment of $38,000. When the Registrar receives notification of Max's new amended taxable income of $38,000, it is applied to the child support assessment from the beginning of the CSP because Max took action to amend the previous tax assessment within 28 days of receiving notice of the previous tax assessment.


Circumstances beyond the parent's knowledge or control include situations where the parent relied on incorrect advice when preparing their tax return, or where a third party, such as their employer, tax agent or the ATO, made an error which resulted in an incorrect tax assessment. The parent may not be aware of the error when their tax assessment issues, but as long as they apply to the ATO for an amendment within 28 days of being notified or otherwise becoming aware of the error, they will satisfy this condition.


Example:In addition to a small wage from a part-time job, Adrian receives a non-taxable disability support pension. Adrian receives help with his tax return from a volunteer, who in error includes his tax-free pension as taxable income. As a result of Adrian's tax assessment, his child support (1.1.C.60) payments increase. Adrian seeks further information from Services Australia about the increase in his child support payments and subsequently identifies the error in his tax assessment. Adrian gets help to lodge an amendment to his tax assessment and does so more than 28 days after the original tax assessment was lodged, but within 28 days of becoming aware of the error. The Registrar is satisfied that the circumstances that prevented Adrian from becoming aware of the error in his original tax assessment within 28 days of receiving it were beyond his knowledge and control, and that Adrian took action to correct the tax assessment within 28 days of becoming aware of the error. The Registrar amends the child support assessment to reflect the lower amended tax assessment from the beginning of the CSP.


Example:Jen lodges her tax return through an accountant and her tax assessment of $38,000 issues in October. In December, Jen receives her tax documents from her accountant. Jen does not review the documents until May, at which time she notices that income from a temporary job was counted twice, inflating her income by $5,000. Jen then lodges an amendment with the ATO. When her amended tax assessment of $33,000 issues, Services Australia confirms that Jen received her tax documents from her accountant in December, at which time she could have identified the error. Jen did not lodge an amendment until more than 28 days after receiving the original tax assessment and the reason for not taking earlier action to correct the error was not due to circumstances beyond her knowledge or control. Jen's amended income of $33,000 applies to the child support assessment from the day after the Registrar was notified by the ATO of the amended income.


The phrase 'special circumstances' is not defined in the CSA Act, however, it is generally taken to mean that the facts of the case must establish something special or out of the ordinary. In the context of amended tax assessments, special circumstances may include serious ill health, natural disaster, incarceration or some other exceptional circumstance that prevented the parent from applying for the amendment to their tax assessment in a timely manner.


Example:Bill lodges his tax return on time and when his tax assessment issues, he notices an error that inflated his income. The following week Bill is hospitalised for several weeks with a serious medical condition. Three months later, Bill lodges an amendment to his original tax assessment with the ATO. When his lower amended tax assessment issues, the Registrar confirms that Bill's ill health prevented him from lodging the amendment within 28 days of receiving his original tax assessment. The Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances apply, and Bill's lower amended taxable income applies retrospectively from the beginning of the CSP.


## Original tax assessment was lodged late


For CSPs where the parent's original tax assessment was not lodged on time (as required under income tax legislation), the child support assessment will not be amended from the beginning of the relevant CSP, unless the amended taxable income is:

• higher than the original taxable income but lower than the provisional income (section 58A(3C))
• lower than the original taxable income but any of the following applies (section 58A(3D))the parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of receiving the original tax assessment noticethe parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of becoming aware of an error in the original tax assessment and the reason for not taking earlier action to correct the error was due to circumstances beyond the parent's knowledge or control, orthe Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances exist.
• the parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of receiving the original tax assessment notice
• the parent applied for the amendment to their tax assessment within 28 days of becoming aware of an error in the original tax assessment and the reason for not taking earlier action to correct the error was due to circumstances beyond the parent's knowledge or control, or
• the Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances exist.

Example:The Registrar makes an assessment for a CSP commencing on 1 September. As there is no ATO assessment or income information available for one parent, Pedro, the Registrar determines his income to be default income (two-thirdsMTAWE(2.3.2) (1.1.D.20)). Pedro lodges his tax return late and his ATO assessed income is lower than the income determined by the Registrar (two-thirds MTAWE). The child support assessment is amended to reflect the lower income from the day after the Registrar received notification of the tax assessment. Six months later, Pedro identifies an error in his tax assessment when he is filing his paperwork and lodges an amendment with the ATO. Pedro's amended tax assessment is lower than his original tax assessment. The Registrar confirms that there were no circumstances beyond Pedro's knowledge or control that prevented him from lodging the amendment within 28 days of receiving his original tax assessment. Pedro's lower amended income applies to the child support assessment from the day after the Registrar was notified of the amended tax assessment by the ATO.


Example:The Registrar makes an assessment for a CSP commencing 1 August based on one parent's ATI for the last relevant year. The Registrar determines a provisional income of $60,000 for the other parent, Jess, based on her taxable income from an earlier year. Jess lodges her tax return for the last relevant year late and the lower ATO assessed income amount of $51,000 applies to the child support assessment from the day after the Registrar receives notification from the ATO. The ATO then identifies an error in Jess's tax return and issues an amended tax assessment of $55,000. Because Jess's amended income is higher than her original income, but lower than the income determined by the Registrar, the provisional income still applies from the start of the CSP until the day before her original ATO assessed income was received. The Registrar amends the child support assessment to reflect Jess's higher amended income of $55,000 from the date her original ATO assessed income applied to the CSP.

# 3.3.3 When provisional incomes are replaced by tax assessments


## Context


When a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is made using a provisional income (1.1.P.130) for a parent (1.1.P.10), this may be replaced with a tax assessment.


A provisional income may not replace a tax assessment for a past period. The rules around how provisional incomes are replaced are designed to encourage parents to lodge their tax returns on time and to minimise the risk that the other parent will be required to pay a debt or overpayment (1.1.O.20) due to the late lodgement of tax returns.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, section 5A, section 58


## Description


When the Registrar has calculated a provisional income for a particular year and subsequently ascertains the parent’s actualATI(1.1.A.20) (when a tax assessment issues for the parent) the child support assessment must be amended immediately (CSA Act section 58A).


A provisional income will be replaced with a taxable income (1.1.T.20) for the entire child support assessment if this is higher than the provisional income. The provisional income will only be replaced by a taxable income in the child support assessment if this is lower than the provisional income when:

• tax lodgement rules have been complied with. The taxable income will replace the provisional income in full
• tax lodgement rules have not been complied with. The taxable income will replace the provisional income in theCSP(1.1.C.150) from the day after this was received from theATO.

## Parent has lodged tax return on time


If the parent lodged their tax return on time, or still has time to lodge their tax return on time, as required under the income tax legislation (3.2.1) the date of effect of the amendment to the child support assessment will be the beginning of the relevant CSP (CSA Act section 58A(2)).


## Parent is late lodging their tax return


If the parent does not lodge their tax return on time as required under the income tax legislation (3.2.1), the date of effect of the amendment to the child support assessment will take effect from the day after the assessment was amended, for the remainder of the CSP, unless one of the following circumstances applies:

• the parent's ATI subsequently ascertained or later determined by the Registrar is higher than the amount previously determined
• the parent was genuinely unable to provide the Registrar with timely information due to the parent being unaware that an assessment had been made, serious ill health or injury, natural disaster, remote location, imprisonment, or other exceptional circumstances and the parent provided income information as soon as was practicable in the circumstances, or
• the parent resided overseas, was not required to lodge a tax return and the parent provided information about their income to the Registrar within a reasonable time in the circumstances.

If the Registrar is satisfied that one or more of the above apply, the assessment can be amended to use the new ATI retrospectively.


## Exceptional circumstances


When making a decision about whether the circumstances prescribed by CSA Regs section 11 apply, the Registrar must consider all the relevant facts of the parent's particular circumstances and the extent to which they contributed to the parent's delay in providing information about their income to the Registrar.


For the purposes of section 11(1)(c) of the CSA Regs, the Registrar will consider a person provided their income information to the Registrar as soon as was practicable if they provided that information within a reasonable period of time after the special or exceptional circumstances ceased to affect them. A decision about whether the parent provided their income information to the Registrar as soon as was practicable will require an examination of the parent's individual circumstances.


Otherwise, the amendment to the assessment will take effect from the day after the assessment was amended, for the remainder of the CSP.


Example:In July 2018, Services Australia receive Lexi’s tax assessment and calculate a new child support assessment for the CSP 1 August 2018 to 31 October 2019. As Lexi’s former partner Shannon has not lodged his tax return, a provisional income of $40,000 for 2017-18 is calculated.


Shannon lodges his 2017-18 tax return late (on 15 July 2019) and his actual ATI is $43,000. As Shannon's actual ATI is higher than the provisional income amount, the child support assessment would be adjusted from 1 August 2018.


Example:In the above example, if Shannon’s actual ATI was $38,000, the child support assessment would be amended on 15 July 2019 to take effect from 16 July 2019. The date of effect is the day after the assessment is amended, as Shannon's tax return was lodged late and his actual ATI is lower the provisional ATI and none of the other circumstances in section 58A(2) of the CSA Act applied.


Example:Graham’s child support assessment is made for a CSP commencing 8 August 2018. Graham's 2017-18 tax assessment was not available due to his serious ill health, so his 2016-17 tax assessment was inflated to determine a provisional ATI of $55,000 for the purpose of the new assessment.


On 5 February 2019, Graham's tax return for 2017-18 was lodged as his health had improved, and his ATI was $43,000. Graham advises the Registrar that the late lodgement was due to his serious ill health. The Registrar, after considering all the relevant facts in Graham's case, determines, as per section 11(1)(c) of the CSA Regs, that Graham has provided his income information within a reasonable period of time in the circumstances.


Graham's 2017-18 actual ATI of $43,000 is lower than the provisional ATI $55,000 used for the assessment. The Registrar amends the assessment to use the actual ATI from the beginning of the CSP, 8 August 2018, as the date of effect can be applied retrospectively in these circumstances.


## New information about incomes used in CSP commencing from 1 July 2008


Before 1 July 2008, the Registrar could determine a default income to be used to make a child support assessment, if the parent's taxable income could not be ascertained.


Prior to 23 May 2018, if the Registrar had based a parent's child support assessment on a default income (1.1.D.20) for a CSP which commenced before 1 July 2008 and later ascertained the parent's taxable income and/or supplementary income amounts, then the Registrar was required to immediately amend the child support assessment. This determined that the taxable income was the taxable and/or supplementary income amounts.


From 23 May 2018 the rules for CSPs commencing before 1 July 2008 were amended to be the same as the rules in effect from 1 July 2008.


If the CSP commenced prior to 1 July 2008, and the child support assessment used a default income, and the parent's taxable income and/or supplementary income amounts were subsequently ascertained the new rules meant Services Australia:

• WOULD NOT amend the child support assessment if the new amount is lower than the previous income amount, and
• MUST amend the child support assessment if the parent's new amount is higher than the previous income amount.

# 3.4 Estimated income


## Context


Child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are generally based on both parents’ (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20) from the last relevant financial year (1.1.L.10) and the level of care (1.1.C.10) they provide for their children. If a parent’s income has reduced by 15% or more from the income used in their assessment, they can elect for their assessment to be based on an estimate of their current income.

# 3.4.1 Making an income estimate election


## Context


When a parent’s (1.1.P.10) income has reduced by 15% or more from theATI(1.1.A.20) used in their child support assessment (1.1.C.70), they can replace the existing ATI with an estimate of their current income.


The parent’s income estimate (1.1.I.20) is reconciled against their actual income after the financial year ends (3.4.4).


## On this page

• When can a parent estimate their income?
• What income must be estimated?
• Effect of an income estimate
• Refusing to accept an income estimate
• Revoking an income estimate

## When can a parent estimate their income?


A parent can elect to estimate their income if in the case of a first election for a year of income (1.1.Y.10), the estimate is 85% or less than the person's ATI for the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10), and an income amount order (1.1.I.10) is not in force on the start day of the estimate election or for any day in the remainder of the financial year.


The ATI must be based on:

• the parent's ATI as advised by theATO
• the person's ATI as advised by the relevant overseas authority (1.1.O.30) (where the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.90)), or
• a declaration by the parent of their ATI which the Registrar is satisfied is correct.

If the parent’s income had reduced by less than 15%, the parent can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) to reflect their current financial circumstances (Part 5).


When the Registrar is required to calculate a notional assessment (due to a child support agreement), a parent can vary their provisional notional assessment (1.1.P.140) by making an income estimate election, see6.3.2subheading 'Varying a provisional notional assessment'.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 58C Determination of overseas income …, section 60(1)(b) Parent may elect to estimate …, section 60(6) No election if an income amount order is in force, section 63(2A) Effect of later election, section 162A Obtaining information in relation …


## What income must be estimated?


The income components of a parent's ATI (3.1.1) for an income estimate, are the same income ATI components that apply when a parent's income is based on their tax assessment. However, a tax assessment uses ATI from the last relevant financial year, while an estimate of income is an estimate of income for the current financial year.


The components of estimated ATI are:

• taxable income (1.1.T.20) for that year of income
• reportable fringe benefits total (1.1.R.70) for that year of income
• target foreign income (1.1.T.10) for that year of income
• total net investment losses (1.1.T.50) for that year of income
• tax free pensions or benefits (1.1.T.30) received in that year of income, and
• reportable superannuation contributions (1.1.R.80) in that year of income.

Where a parent is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction, the parent's ATI will include their overseas income (CSA Act section 58B).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 58C Determination of overseas income …, section 60(1)(b) Parent may elect to estimate …, section 60(6) No election if an income amount order is in force, section 63(2A) Effect of later election, section 162A Obtaining information in relation …


## Effect of an income estimate


When the Registrar accepts a parent's estimate election, the assessment will be amended to take the income estimate into account. The parent’s income estimate becomes their ATI for the purposes of assessing the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable in the application period (1.1.A.90).


Notice of the amended assessment is sent to both parents. A notice is also sent to the parent who made the estimate requiring them to inform the Registrar of any event that affects the accuracy of their income estimate election.


An estimate does not prevent a later income amount order (3.4.2), change of assessment decision (Part 5), court departure order or agreement (Part 9) from affecting the assessment for any part of the application period.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 6 Interpretation—expressions used in Registration and Collection Act, section 160 Notification requirements, section 162A(2) Obtaining information in relation …


## Refusing to accept an income estimate


The Registrar can refuse to accept an income estimate election if satisfied that the parent's ATI for that current year is likely to be higher than their estimated amount.


The Registrar can refuse to accept a part year income estimate (3.4.2) if satisfied that the actual:

• year to date income amount will be higher than the estimated year to date income amount, or
• partial year income amount is likely to be more than the parent's estimated partial income amount for the remaining period.

Example:Jack contacts Services Australia on 26 July to advise that he lost his job on 15 July. Jack is currently assessed using an ATI of $75,000. Jack wants to estimate his income for the remainder of the year. The application period of the election is 26 July to 30 June. Jack advises that his income for the remaining period will be $10,000, made up of some interest income and income from some casual employment. Jack states that he is currently unemployed and not entitled to receive any pension or benefits due to the income of his partner (1.1.P.20). Jack advises he does not have any other income components.


The Registrar considers Jack's income history and previous estimate records. It is noted that Jack has a seasonal pattern to his employment, that Jack frequently ceases employment in July/August and then becomes employed again several months later. Jack has been employed by the same employer for a number of years. Jack is asked to provide documentation from the employer to confirm that future employment is unlikely, and that the previous pattern of employment is no longer relevant.


Jack does not provide the requested documentation. The Registrar refuses to accept the income estimate election as it is considered likely that the partial year income amount provided by Jack is less than the actual amount Jack is likely to receive in the remaining period.


Example:Donna contacts Services Australia on 26 August to advise that she lost her job on 15 August. Donna is currently assessed using an ATI of $75,000. Donna wants to estimate her income for the remainder of the year. The application period of the election is 26 August to 30 June. Donna advises that her income for the remaining period will be $10,000, made up of some interest income and income from some casual employment. Donna is not entitled to receive any pension or benefits, due to the income of her partner. Donna advises that she does not have any other income components. Donna advises that she received a redundancy package from her previous employer, where she had worked for 5 years. Donna advises that her year to date income is $90,000. Donna is asked to provide documentation regarding the year to date income in order to be satisfied that the year to date income amount is accurate.


Donna does not provide the requested documentation. The Registrar refuses to accept the income estimate election as it is considered likely that the year to date income amount provided by Donna is more than the actual amount Donna received in the year to date period.


If the Registrar refuses to accept an estimate, the parent will be given written notice of the decision. The parent can object to the particulars of the assessment in relation to which the parent sought to make the income election (Part 10).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 63AA Registrar may refuse to accept an income election, section 63AB Notice to be given if Registrar refuses to accept an income election


CSRC Actsection 80(1) item 11 Decisions against which objections may be lodged—general


## Revoking an income estimate


A parent may revoke an income election by giving notice to the Registrar. If the application period for that income estimate has:

• not yet started, the estimate is revoked and taken never to have been made. The assessment will be amended to revert to the income that was used before the income estimate election was made
• already commenced, the parent must make a new election (update their income estimate).

Example:Ben contacted Services Australia on 26 May to advise that he was now unemployed. Ben made an income estimate election for that year of income, from 26 May to 30 June and also for the next year, from 1 July to 30 June. On 28 June, Ben contacts Services Australia to advise that he'll be starting work on 2 July. Ben revokes the estimate for the year 1 July to 30 June. As the application period for that election has not started, the estimate is revoked and Ben is not required to make another estimate for that year.

# 3.3.1 Why provisional incomes are used


## Context


Provisional incomes (1.1.P.130) may be used when a parent (1.1.P.10) has not yet lodged a tax return for a relevant financial year (1.1.L.10), or they have lodged aRNNadvice with theATO. They may be used to ensure a parent’s financial capacity is reflected in the child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


As an RNN advice does not provide income information, Services Australia will calculate a provisional income based on the most up-to-date income information (3.3.2).


Provisional incomes seek to:

• ensure child support assessments are updated regularly even when a parent has not lodged a tax return
• ensure child support assessments are based on the most current income information available
• prevent delays to updating the child support assessment when only one parent has lodged their tax return after a financial year
• encourage parents to lodge their tax returns on time, and
• minimise the instance of either parent being required to pay a debt or overpayment (1.1.O.20), when a child support assessment is retrospectively updated when the other parent lodges their tax return.

# 3.3.2 Types of provisional incomes


## Context


The CSA Act allows the Registrar to calculate different types of provisional incomes (1.1.P.130) based on the income information available for a parent (1.1.P.10). A hierarchy applies to ensure the most accurate provisional income is calculated.


## Act references


## On this page

• Income information is provided or available
• Parent lodges a return not necessary (RNN) advice with the ATO
• Tax assessment available for the previous year of income
• Tax assessment available for an earlier year
• No tax assessment available
• Determination of overseas income where parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction(1.1.R.90)

## Income information is provided or available


If the Registrar or theATOhas been given information (orally, in writing) that specifies or allows the Registrar to work out the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) for the last relevant financial year (1.1.L.10), the Registrar may use that income information to determine the parent's provisional income (section 58). For example:

• the parent may have informed the Registrar of their income for the year
• the ATO may have full year payment summary information recorded for a parent
• the Registrar may have informationabout the Centrelink payments made to the parent for the year, orfrom an overseas authority (1.1.O.30) about the income earned by a parent who was resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction.
• about the Centrelink payments made to the parent for the year, or
• from an overseas authority (1.1.O.30) about the income earned by a parent who was resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction.

The Registrar must be satisfied that the amount specified or worked out is a reasonable approximation of the parent's ATI for the year (section 58(2)(c)). In making that decision, the Registrar will have regard to tax assessments for previous years or information available from the ATO or other sources about the year in question.


Example:An application for an assessment is accepted in July 2019, with the firstCSP(1.1.C.150) being 22 July 2019 to 21 September 2020. A parent, Solange, has not yet lodged their 2018-19 tax return. Solange advises that their ATI for 2018-19 is $49,000. As this information is consistent with Solange's previous tax assessments the Registrar is satisfied of the accuracy of the information. The Registrar uses the ATI of $49,000 to calculate the child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


Example:An application for an assessment is accepted in July 2019, with the first CSP being 22 July 2019 to 21 September 2020. A parent, Nicoline, has not yet lodged their 2018-19 tax return. Nicoline advises that their ATI for 2018-19 is $19,000. As there is no tax assessment available for Nicoline, the Registrar requests additional information in order to be satisfied with the accuracy of the information. Nicoline does not provide any additional information. As the Registrar is not satisfied with the accuracy of the information Nicoline's oral advice is not used to determine an ATI.


Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment in July 2019 for a new CSP from 1 August 2019 as the assessment for the CSP 1 May 2018 to 31 July 2019 is about to end. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2018-19 and a 2018-19 tax assessment has not yet issued for either Tarek or Francine. As the Registrar has income information from Centrelink for Tarek, that income will be used as Tarek's ATI in the assessment.


## Parent lodges aRNNadvice with the ATO


As a RNN advice is not a tax assessment of the parent’s income, the Registrar is required to determine that parent’s ATI for that relevant financial year.


If a parent lodges a RNN advice for the 2021-22 and prior financial years, the Registrar is required to make a determination of the parent’s ATI for the relevant financial year based on the most recent income information available.


Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment for a new CSP from 1 August 2022. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2021-22. Maryam, lodges a RNN advice with the ATO for 2021-22 (Maryam was eligible forJSPon each day of 2021-22, and had income less than $27,063). Unless Maryam contacts Services Australia to advise their ATI for 2021-22, the Registrar will need to determine an ATI based on the most recent income information. Services Australia have income information that Maryam received $16,000 in JSP for the 2021-22 year. The Registrar determines Maryam’s ATI to be $16,000.


If a parent lodges a RNN advice for the 2022-23 and subsequent financial years, the Registrar may determine the parent’s ATI (section 58(2A)) to be equal to the self-support amount (1.1.S.20) that applied on 1 January of the financial year for which the RNN advice applied (section 58(2B)).


Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment for a new CSP from 1 August 2023. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2022-23. Timothy, lodges a RNN advice with the ATO for 2022-23 because they were eligible for JSP on each day of 2022-23, and their total income was $27,508 or less (equal to the 2023 self-support amount). Upon receiving the RNN advice from the ATO for 2022-23, the Registrar determines Timothy’s ATI for the last relevant year is $27,508 (the self-support amount which applied on 1 January 2023).


## Tax assessment available for the previous year of income


When a tax assessment is available for the year before the last relevant year of income, the ATI indexation factor (2.3.2) (1.1.A.130) is used to calculate the ATI to be used in the assessment (section 58(3)).


The provisional income is calculated by multiplying the parent’s income for the previous year by the ATI indexation factor.


Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment for a new CSP from 1 August 2022. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2021-22 and a tax assessment is available for the previous year 2020-21 ($30,000). TheAWEamount for:

• 2021-22 is the 2021 amount $1,328.90
• 2020-21 is the 2020 amount of $1,291.30

The ATI indexation factor is $1,328.90 ÷ $1,291.30 = 1.029.


The 2021-22 provisional income is $30,000 × 1.029 = $30,870.


## Tax assessment available for an earlier year


If there is no tax assessment for a parent for the last relevant year of income, or the previous year, but there is a tax assessment for an earlier year of income, the Registrar may determine that the parent's provisional income for the last relevant year of income is the greater of (section 58(4)):

• the amount worked out by multiplying the parent's taxable income (1.1.T.20) for the most recent income year by the ATI indexation factor
• two-thirdsMTAWEdefault income (1.1.D.20) for the CSP (2.4.1).

When the most recent tax assessment has been located, the 'tax year' used in the ATI indexation factor calculation (as described above) is that year.


Example:The Registrar is required to make an assessment for a new CSP from 1 August 2019. The last relevant year of income for the new assessment is 2018-19. The AWE amount for 2018-19 is the 2018 amount of $1,225.00.

• Julia's most recent tax assessment is for the 2014-15 year (Julia’s taxable income was $30,000). The AWE amount for 2014-15 is the 2014 amount of $1,128.90.The ATI indexation factor is $1,225.00 ÷ $1,128.90 = 1.085.
• The ATI indexation factor is $1,225.00 ÷ $1,128.90 = 1.085.
• Arvid's most recent tax assessment is for the 2016-17 year (Arvid’s taxable income was $60,000). The AWE amount for 2016-17 is the 2016 amount of $1,164.60.The ATI indexation factor is $1,225.00 ÷ $1,164.60 = 1.052.
• The ATI indexation factor is $1,225.00 ÷ $1,164.60 = 1.052.

The Registrar must compare the indexed ATI with the two-thirds MTAWE default income for the CSP.


Julia's 2018-19 ATI is determined to be $50,076, which is the greater of:

• $30,000 × 1.085 = $32,550
• $50,076 (2019 two-thirds MTAWE default income).

Arvid's 2018-19 ATI is determined to be $63,120, which is the greater of:

• $60,000 × 1.052 = $63,120
• $50,076 (default income).

## No tax assessment available


If the Registrar is not able to determine a provisional income for a parent (or if the Registrar has decided not to make a determination) based on:

• income information provided or available
• a tax assessment for a previous year which can be indexed by the ATI indexation factor
• a tax assessment for an earlier year which can be indexed by the ATI indexation factor

then the Registrar may determine that the parent's ATI is a two-thirds MTAWE default income. This default income is intended to cover circumstances such as where a parent has never lodged a tax return, or where the Registrar is unable to ascertain a person'sTFN.


Example:An application for an assessment is accepted in July 2019, with the first CSP being 22 July 2019 to 21 September 2020. Parent Magda is not able to be contacted, nor is any taxable income information able to be located for Magda. The Registrar determines that Magda's ATI is $50,076 which is the default income for CSPs commencing in 2019.


If the default income is higher than their actual income, the parent may choose to lodge their tax return so their assessment can be amended to reflect their actual income for the year. The new assessment can only take effect with retrospective effect in a limited range of situations, as described below.


## Determination of overseas income where parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction


If the Registrar has sufficient information and documents, the Registrar may use that information to determine an amount of overseas income for the purpose of working out the ATI of a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (section 58C). For example, the Registrar may have received evidence of income in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) in which the parent resides, or recently resided. This may include information from the most recent financial year in that jurisdiction.


If the Registrar does not have sufficient information to determine a parent's overseas income, despite requesting income information from the parent or an overseas authority, the Registrar may determine that the parent's overseas income is an amount that the Registrar considers appropriate of two-thirds MTAWE default income for the CSP (section 58D).


If the Registrar does not have sufficient information or documents to determine an amount of overseas income for the last relevant year of income, but a determination has been made for a previous year of income, the Registrar will generally determine that the parent's ATI for the last relevant year of income is the greater of the following amounts:

• the amount worked out by multiplying the parent's ATI for the most recent income year by the ATI indexation factor, or
• the two-thirds MTAWE default income amount for the CSP.

If the Registrar does not have sufficient information to determine an overseas income and is unable to serve a notice on either the parent or the relevant overseas authority, then the Registrar is unable to determine an overseas income for that parent for inclusion in their taxable income.

# 3.2.3 New information about ATI


## Introduction


The Registrar (1.2.1.10) may receive new information about a parent's (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20). There are rules about whether this new information can be used to amend a parent's child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


Where new information about the parent's income is as a result of an amended tax assessment issued by theATO, different rules apply. For information about when a child support assessment can be amended to take into account an amended tax assessment, see3.2.2.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 58, section 58AA, section 58A


Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Act 2011


Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018


## Description


When the Registrar receives new information about a person’s taxable income (1.1.T.20), the relevant child support assessment may be updated depending on the period the income will apply to.


Legislative changes introduced new rules for assessments from 1 July 2008.The Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018further amended the rules from 23 May 2018 forCSPs (1.1.C.150) that commenced before 1 July 2008, to align with the rules used for CSPs that commenced on or after 1 July 2008.


The changes introduced by theFamilies, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Act 2011apply to CSPs starting on or after 1 July 2011.


## New information about ATI


Where the Registrar has made a determination of a parent's ATI (calculated a provisional income (1.1.P.130) (3.3)) for a particular year and subsequently ascertains the parent's actual taxable income for that year (when a tax assessment issues for the parent), the child support assessment must be amended immediately (CSA Act section 58A). The assessment must also be amended if the Registrar obtains other new information about a parent's ATI and makes a later determination of the appropriate ATI amount (CSA Act section 58A). The later determination of ATI will be subject to the different rules pre- and post-1 July 2011, depending on which financial year the later determination relates to.


If more recent income information becomes available that would allow the Registrar to determine a more current indexed income for the parent, another ATI will be determined, and the assessment will be amended to use the more recent information.


## Date of effect of amended assessment


### Parent has lodged tax return on time


If the parent lodged their tax return on time, or still has time to lodge, his or her tax return on time as required under the income tax legislation (for example, under a relevant tax agent lodgement program), the date of effect of the amendment to the child support assessment will be the beginning of the relevantCSPwhere (CSA Act section 58A(2)).


### Parent is late lodging their tax return


If the parent does not lodge their tax return on time as required under the income tax legislation (for example, under a relevant tax agent lodgement program), the date of effect of the amendment to the child support assessment will take effect from the day after the assessment was amended, for the remainder of the CSP, unless one of the following circumstances applies:

• the parent's ATI subsequently ascertained or later determined by the Registrar is higher than the amount previously determined
• the parent was genuinely unable to provide the Registrar with timely information due to the parent being unaware that an assessment had been made, serious ill health or injury, natural disaster, remote location, imprisonment, or other exceptional circumstances and the parent provided income information as soon as was practicable in the circumstances, or
• the parent resided overseas, was not required to lodge a tax return and the parent provided information about his or her income to the Registrar within a reasonable time in the circumstances.

If the Registrar is satisfied that one or more of the above apply, the assessment can be amended to use the new ATI retrospectively.


## Exceptional circumstances


When making a decision about whether the circumstances prescribed by CSA Regs section 11 apply, the Registrar must consider all the relevant facts of the parent's particular circumstances and the extent to which they contributed to the parent's delay in providing information about their income to the Registrar.


For the purposes of section 11(1)(c) of the CSA Regs, the Registrar will consider a person provided their income information to the Registrar as soon as was practicable if they provided that information within a reasonable period of time after the special or exceptional circumstances ceased to affect them. A decision about whether the parent provided their income information to the Registrar as soon as was practicable will require an examination of the parent's individual circumstances.


Otherwise, the amendment to the assessment will take effect from the day after the assessment was amended, for the remainder of the CSP.


Example:In July 2018, Services Australia receive Lexi’s tax assessment and calculate a new child support assessment for the CSP 1 August 2018 to 31 October 2019. As Lexi’s former partner Shannon has not lodged his tax return, a provisional income of $40,000 for 2017-18 is calculated.


Shannon lodges his 2017-18 tax return late (on 15 July 2019) and his actual ATI is $43,000. As Shannon's actual ATI is higher than the provisional income amount, the child support assessment would be adjusted from 1 August 2018.


Example:In the above example, if Shannon’s actual ATI was $38,000, the child support assessment would be amended on 15 July 2019 to take effect from 16 July 2019. Under section 58A(3) of the CSA Act, the date of effect is the day after the assessment is amended, as Shannon's tax return was lodged late and his actual ATI is lower than the provisional ATI and none of the other circumstances in section 58A(2) of the CSA Act applied.


Example:The Registrar made an assessment for a CSP commencing 1 August 2019. As there was no tax assessment available, the provisional ATI used in this assessment was $50,076 (default income (two-thirdsMTAWE) (2.3.2)). On 26 September 2019, Amit's 2014-15 tax assessment issues and his actual ATI for 2014-15 is $52,000.


The Registrar calculates a new provisional ATI of $56,420 for Amit for 2018-19 using the ATI indexation factor (2.3.2).


The Registrar retrospectively amends the assessment from the beginning of the CSP, 1 August 2019, because the new provisional ATI of $56,420 is higher than the previous provisional ATI of $50,076.


Example:Graham’s child support assessment is made for a CSP commencing 8 August 2018. Graham's 2017-18 tax assessment was not available due to his serious ill health, so his 2016-17 tax assessment was inflated to determine a provisional ATI of $55,000 for the purpose of the new assessment.


On 5 February 2019, Graham's tax return for 2017-18 was lodged as his health had improved, and his ATI was $43,000. Graham advises the Registrar that the late lodgement was due to his serious ill health. The Registrar, after considering all the relevant facts in Graham's case, determines, as per section 11(1)(c) of the CSA Regs, that Graham has provided his income information within a reasonable period of time in the circumstances.


Graham's 2017-18 actual ATI of $43,000 is lower than the provisional ATI $55,000 used for the assessment. The Registrar amends the assessment to use the actual ATI from the beginning of the CSP, 8 August 2018, as the date of effect can be applied retrospectively in these circumstances.


## New information about incomes used before 1 July 2008


The CSA Act in operation before 1 July 2008 permitted the Registrar to identify a default income to be used in assessments if the parent's taxable income could not be ascertained.


Prior to 23 May 2018, if the Registrar has based a parent's child support assessment on a default income, and the parent's taxable income and/or supplementary amounts is later ascertained, then the Registrar must immediately amend the child support assessment on the basis that the taxable and/or supplementary amounts is and always has been the taxable income.


However, from 23 May 2018 theFamily Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Actamended the CSA Act to align the rules for periods before 1 July 2008 to the current rules for periods on and after 1 July 2008. Therefore, if the Registrar has based a parent's child support assessment on a default income, and the parent's taxable income and/or supplementary amount is subsequently ascertained and:

• the new amount is lower than the previous income amount, the Registrar would not amend the child support assessment, or
• the parent's the new amount is higher than the previous income amount, the Registrar must amend the child support assessment.

The above is applicable to all assessments up to 30 June 2008.


The Registrar can ascertain a taxable income in this situation even if the ATO has not made an income tax assessment. It can act on information that provides a better basis for a default income.


However, the Registrar will not amend an assessment if a parent provides details of income and supplementary amounts and the Registrar has other evidence that suggests that the information provided is incorrect.


Example:Daniel's taxable income and supplementary amounts cannot be ascertained because Daniel hasn't lodged a tax return for the relevant year (2006-07). Daniel has been asked to provide details of taxable and supplementary incomes for the relevant year, but he doesn't provide the details requested. The Registrar can make a child support assessment using an income amount considered appropriate and decides to use an amount of $32,000 based on Daniel's past income history. Daniel later lodges a tax return for the 2006-07 year, and his taxable income is assessed to be $28,000 and there are no supplementary amounts. The Registrar does not amend the child support assessment as Daniel's actual taxable income of $28,000 is lower than the default income used by the Registrar.

# 3.4.2 Calculating an income estimate


## Context


Child support (1.1.C.60) legislation provides a method statement setting out how a parent (1.1.P.10) is to calculate theirATI(1.1.A.20) when electing that it be based on an estimated amount. The method depends on whether the parent is estimating their ATI for a full or part year.


To apply a part-year income estimate (1.1.I.20) to the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), the Registrar must annualise the partial year income amount.


A parent’s full year or part-year income estimate is reconciled with their actual income after the financial year (3.4.4).


## On this page

• Full-year income estimate
• Part-year income estimate
• Part-year income estimate - year to date income amount
• Part-year income estimate - remaining period
• Part-year income estimate - partial year income amount
• Part-year income estimate - annualised partial year income amount

## Full-year income estimate


A parent may estimate their ATI for a full-year of income (1.1.Y.10) before that year starts, or on the first day of the year. The estimate must be the total of all income component amounts of the parent's ATI for the year of income.


The estimate will commence on 1 July and cease on 30 June of that income year. From 1 July of the next year of income, the assessment will revert to the most recently available ATI (provided an estimate does not apply in relation to the next financial year).


Example:Anders and Olga have a child support assessment for the period 1 May 2018 to 31 July 2019, based on their 2016-17 incomes (the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10)). Anders’ ATI in the assessment is $60,000. On 1 July 2018, Anders contacts Services Australia advising that his income has reduced.


Anders estimates that his ATI for the 2018-19 year will be $38,000, which includes taxable income (1.1.T.20) of $24,000, an $8,000 net investment loss and a $6,000 reportable fringe benefit. He does not have any other income components.


As there is no income amount order (1.1.I.10) in force and the income estimate is less than 85% of the ATI used in the assessment, Anders is able to elect to use his income estimate of $38,000 to calculate the assessment for the year.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 60(2) Estimate for a whole year of income,section 61(1A) The application period for an election …


## Part-year income estimate


A part-year income estimate is an estimate of income that is made after the first day of a financial year, and will start either:

• the day on which the parent makes the election, or
• the first day of aCSP(1.1.C.150), so long as that day is not before the day the parent makes the election.

Example:Sarah contacts Services Australia on 26 August to advise that she lost her job on 15 August. Sarah wants to estimate her income for the remainder of the year of income. The start date of her income estimate election is 26 August, the day she made her election.


Example:Justine received a new assessment for a CSP beginning 1 October. Justine calls Services Australia on 26 September to advise that her current income is less than that used in the new assessment. As Justine expects to continue earning at her current income, she elects to make an income estimate for the new CSP. The start date of the election is the first day of the new CSP, 1 October, as that day is not before the day on which Justine makes the election.


The parent must inform the Registrar of their estimated income for each income component amount for the:

• year to date amount - the total of the income component amounts they have received from the beginning of the year of income to the day before the start day of their income estimate election.
• partial year income amount - the total of the income component amounts for the remaining period which is the period starting on the day they make the election to 30 June of the year of income.

Act reference:CSA Actsection 60(3) Estimate for a part of a year of income etc., section 60(5) The start day for the election must …,section 61(1A) The application period for an election …


## Part-year income estimate - year to date income amount


The year to date income for a part-year income estimate is the total of the income component amounts the parent has received from 1 July of the year of income to the day before the start day of the income estimate election. All income received must be included, even if there was not a child support assessment for all of that period.


Example:Sahand contacts Services Australia on 26 August to advise that he lost his job on 15 August. Sahand wants to estimate his income for the remainder of the year. Sahand advises that he was employed for 6 weeks and received payment of his leave entitlements, equal to 3 weeks' pay, on termination. Sahand advises he does not have any other income components. Sahand estimates his year to date income amount for the period between 1 July and 25 August to be $9,000.


The year to date income amount is taken into account when the parent’s income estimate is reconciled after the end of the year of income (3.4.4). It is therefore important that the parent notifies the Registrar if they identify that the year to date income they provided is inaccurate.


A parent may later update their year to date income amount, if they become aware that the year to date income amount previously advised is incorrect. If required, a parent may make multiple elections to provide a more accurate year to date income.


If the Registrar becomes aware that the year to date income amount is incorrect, the Registrar may determine a new year to date income amount to be used in the assessment. That amount then replaces the previously advised year to date income amount. If the Registrar determines a new year to date income amount, written notice must be provided to the parent. A parent may object to the determination of the year to date income amount (10.2.2).


If one or more year to date income amount elections have been made by a parent, and/or one or more determinations of the year to date income amount have been made by the Registrar, then the year to date income amount used is the last year to date income amount election or determination made. A parent cannot elect to use a new year to date income amount if the estimate has been reconciled.


Example:Richard contacted Services Australia on 24 February and made an income estimate election. Richard estimated his year to date income amount for the period 1 July to 23 February to be $49,000. On 15 May, Richard contacts Services Australia to advise that he realised that he had not included an interest payment in his year to date income. Richard advises that he received an interest payment of $8,400 on 31 October. Richard elects to replace the year to date income amount with the new amount of $57,400.


Example:Mariette contacted Services Australia on 24 February 2020 and made an income estimate election. Mariette estimated her year to date income amount to be $49,000. On 15 May 2020, Mariette elected a new year to date income amount of $57,400. The Registrar subsequently received information indicating the amount that Mariette estimated her year to date income amount to be was more than what her year to date income amount was actually likely to be. On 20 August 2020, the Registrar determined Mariette's year to date income amount to be $42,000. The determination made 20 August 2020 is therefore the applicable year to date income amount.

## Part-year income estimate - remaining period


The remaining period for a part-year income estimate starts on the start date of the election and ends on 30 June of the year of income. A parent must estimate each income component amount for that remaining period to calculate the partial year income amount.


Example:Ly contacts Services Australia on 22 March to advise that she is now working part time. Ly wants to make an income estimate election. The start date of the election is 22 March. The remaining period is 22 March to 30 June.


Example:David received a new assessment for a CSP beginning 1 October. David calls Services Australia on 26 September to advise that his current income is less than that used in the new assessment. David elects to make an income estimate for the new CSP. The start date of his election is 1 October. The remaining period is 1 October to 30 June.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 60(4) Estimate for a part of a year of income etc.


## Part-year income estimate - partial year income amount


The partial year income amount for a part-year income estimate is the total of the estimated income component amounts for the remaining period (CSA Act section 60(4)).


Example:Megan contacts Services Australia on 26 August to advise that she lost her job on 15 August and wants to estimate her income for the remainder of the year. The start date of her income estimate election is 26 August, the day she made her election. The remaining period is from 26 August to 30 June. Megan advises that she will receive Centrelink income benefits of $12,000 during the remaining period. Megan advises that she doesn't have any other income components. Megan's partial year income amount is $12,000.


Example:Frank is self-employed and contacts Services Australia on 26 August to advise his income has reduced due to the loss of a contract. Frank wants to estimate his income for the remainder of the year. The start date of his income estimate election is 26 August, the day he made the election. The remaining period is from 26 August to 30 June. Frank estimates his taxable income for the remaining period will be $36,000, he expects to have $6,000 in reportable fringe benefits and reportable superannuation contributions (1.1.R.80) of $9,200 for the remaining period. Frank doesn't have any other income components. Frank's partial year income amount is $51,200.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 60(4) Estimate for a part of a year of income etc.


## Part-year income estimate - annualised partial year income amount


Child support liabilities are based on annual income. This means that in order to calculate the income amount to be used in the assessment during the remaining period, the partial year income amount must be annualised.


The annualised partial year income amount is the amount which will be used as the parent's ATI when the assessment is amended using the estimated income.


The annualised partial year income amount is not used when reconciling a parent’s income estimate after the year of income. More information on how income estimates are reconciled is provided in3.4.4.


The table below shows the method statement to calculate the annualised partial year income amount to be used.


Example:Joanne has estimated her partial year income amount for the period 1 November to 30 June is $26,500.


There are 242 days in the remaining period.


Joanne’s annualised partial year income estimate is ($26,500 ÷ 242 days) × 365 = $39,969.

# 3.4.3 Updating income estimates & estimate reviews


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) is required to keep their estimate accurate and notify the Registrar of any event that affects the accuracy of their income estimate (1.1.I.20). This obligation is outlined in the notice that is sent to a parent when an estimate is accepted (11.2.3).


A parent can make a later income election (update their estimate) to reflect their changed circumstances. There are no restrictions on the number of times a parent can update their estimate during an assessment period.


The Registrar is also able to review an income estimate to determine its accuracy.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 160 Notification requirements, section 162A Obtaining information in relation to residents of reciprocating jurisdictions


## On this page

• Later income estimate elections - updating an income estimate
• Events affecting the accuracy of an income estimate
• Registrar review and amendment of an assessment
• Refusing to accept a later income estimate
• Retrospective estimate reviews (income decrease)
• Information available
• Effect upon both parties of any change

## Later income estimate elections - updating an income estimate


When a parent updates their estimate, and makes a later income estimate election, the parent must inform the Registrar of the:

• start day of the election, and
• the partial year income amount for the remaining period (3.4.2).

### Start date


The start date of the later income estimate election must be either

• The day on which the parent makes (updates) the new income estimate election
• If the annualised amount of the later income estimate election is more than the amount of the earlier election, the date of the event that affected the parent's income

Example:Emily made an income estimate election on 24 February, as her hours at work had been reduced to part time. Emily contacts Services Australia on 13 April to advise that she is now unemployed. Emily's new election is less than her previous estimate so the start day of the later election is 13 April, the day the election was made.


Example:Ella made an income estimate election on 24 February, as her hours at work had been reduced to part time. Ella contacts Services Australia on 13 April to advise that she has been working full time since 5 April and her income has increased. Ella advises that her income for the remaining period (87 days from 5 April to 30 June) from her employment will be $11,000. Ella is not entitled to receive any pension or benefits, nor will she have any other income components.


The start day of the later income estimate election is 5 April, which is the date Ella’s income increased. Ella’s annualised partial year income amount for the remaining period (based on her later income estimate election) is:

• ($11,000 ÷ 87) x 365 = $46,149.

The Registrar will amend the assessment to take the later income estimate election into account. The new annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) payable takes effect from the start date of the new election.


If the previous estimate resulted in a minimum assessment then theMAR(2.3.4) (1.1.M.20) will continue for 28 days after the day on which the parent would cease to be assessed to pay the minimum rate.


Example:Before the beginning of the year of income (1.1.Y.10), Lincoln makes an income estimate election and is assessed to pay the MAR. Lincoln starts work on 1 March and makes a new income estimate election on that day. Child support is now payable at a rate higher than the MAR. The higher rate (based on Lincoln’s updated income estimate election) will be payable from 29 March, 28 days after the MAR would otherwise cease to be payable.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 62A Parent must elect a new estimate …, section 63 Effect of later election, section 66(4)(b)(ii) When assessment applies


## Events affecting the accuracy of an income estimate


The happening of an event can provide a trigger for reviewing an estimate to decide if the assessment should be amended. An event is also relevant in determining the start day of a later estimate.


An event can include:

• an occurrence that was not expected when the income estimate election was made (for example, starting a new job or non-payment of an expected contract fee), or
• the first day on which the actual rate of income earned was different from the rate of estimated income (that is, the first day the estimated income became inaccurate).

Act reference:CSA Actsection 62A(3) Start day


## Registrar review & amendment of an assessment


The Registrar can amend an assessment based on an income estimate if the Registrar:

• becomes aware of an event that has affected the accuracy of the estimate, or if the parent tells the Registrar that the event has occurred, but the parent does not make a later income estimate election, or
• has sent the parent a notice requesting information relevant to determining the accuracy of the estimate.

Most estimates are reviewed and the assessment amended under section 63A when the Registrar becomes aware that the estimate is no longer accurate.


Example:Danielle changes jobs and makes an income estimate election in January. On 15 May, Danielle gets a promotion which makes the income she estimated in January no longer accurate. On 15 June, Services Australia contacts Danielle to discuss the income change but Danielle chooses not to make a new income estimate election. The Registrar will amend the assessment from 15 May using Danielle's current income.


The Registrar will only review an income estimate under CSA Act section 63B if:

• every attempt has been made to contact the parent but they cannot, or will not, provide any information or make a new estimate
• all efforts to gather income information from third parties have been exhausted, and
• there is still not enough reliable information to proceed with an amendment under CSA Act section 63A.

If a parent complies with a notice issued under CSA Act section 161 or 162A(1) or (4), the Registrar can only amend the assessment to give effect to the review of the estimate from the date that the parent complied with the notice.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 63A Amendment of assessment based on income election if event affecting accuracy of estimate occurs …, section 63B Amendment of assessment based on income election if Registrar asks …, section 161 Obtaining of information and evidence, section 162A Obtaining information in relation to residents of reciprocating jurisdictions


## Refusing to accept a later income estimate


The Registrar can refuse to accept a later income estimate election if satisfied that the parent's partial year income amount (3.4.2) is less than what the Registrar considers is likely to be the parent's actualATI(1.1.A.20) for the remaining period in relation to the income election.


The Registrar will consider all the circumstances and may obtain further information, either from the parent or a third party (for example, an employer or an overseas authority), in making the decision as to whether to refuse to accept the income election. A history of underestimating alone is not enough for the Registrar to refuse to accept an estimate, however it may prompt the Registrar to investigate the circumstances further.


The Registrar will give a parent the opportunity to show that their estimate is accurate before deciding whether to refuse to accept an estimate.


The Registrar may refuse to accept an election to replace a previously advised year to date income amount with a new amount if satisfied that the new amount is more than the amount likely to be the parent's actual income for the period.


If the Registrar refuses to accept the election of a new year to date income amount, written notice of the refusal must be provided to the parent. A parent may object to the decision to refuse the election (10.2.2).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 63AA Registrar may refuse to accept an income election, section 63ADRegistrar may refuse to accept an election of a new year to date income amount


CSRC Actsection 80(1) item 11A Decisions against which objections may be lodged—general


## Retrospective estimate reviews (income decrease)


A parent should advise the Registrar of a change in their income within 14 days of the event that led to the reduction in income. The Registrar will review an estimate and amend the assessment in very limited circumstances where a parent does not advise of a reduction in income within 14 days of the event.


The Registrar will consider the following in order to determine whether it is appropriate to amend the assessment:

• the information available from the parent
• the effect upon both parties of any change, and
• the extent to which the change of income event affects the accuracy of the estimate.

Act reference:CSA Actsection 160 Notification requirements


## Information available


The Registrar will consider the reasons for the delay in updating the income information. The reason for non-compliance with the notification requirements must be compelling before a review will be undertaken.


Example:If a parent was physically incapacitated around the time of the event then this could be a compelling reason why they did not contact the Registrar within 14 days of the event.


The Registrar will also consider the degree to which the decrease in income was not foreseeable by the parent when they made their estimate.


If the Registrar is satisfied that both of these conditions have been met, the Registrar will need to consider the remaining 2 factors before amending the assessment.


## Effect upon both parties of any change


The Registrar will consider whether the effect on both parties to the assessment would be fair and reasonable if the assessment was amended to reduce the child support liability for the period between the event and the date of notification.

# 3.4.4 Reconciling an income estimate


## Context


When a parent (1.1.P.10) makes an income estimate(1.1.I.20) election for a year of income (1.1.Y.10) their income estimate will be reconciled when their actual income for the year of income is known, including all updates made to their income estimate during that year.


Estimates of income are reconciled when the parent’s relevantATI(1.1.A.20) becomes available from theATO. If the parent fails to meet their tax lodgement obligations within 12 months of a financial year ending, the Registrar may determine an ATI for the purposes of reconciling the income estimate.


If the actual ATI is less than or equal to the estimated ATI, no further action will be taken. If the parent's actual ATI is more than their estimated ATI, the assessment will be amended using their actual ATI.


## On this page

• Calculating a parent’s estimated ATI – more than one income estimate
• Reconciling an income estimate
• Reconciling an income estimate - actual ATI is known within 12 months
• Reconciling using a Registrar determined ATI

## Calculating a parent’s estimated ATI – more than one income estimate


The table below shows the method statement to calculating a parent’s estimated ATI for the purpose of reconciling a full year or part year income estimate, where a parent has updated their income estimate after it was first accepted.


The estimated ATI for the year is the total of the income expected in each application period (1.1.A.90) for each income estimate election for the year of income.


On 27 May 2020, Matthew estimates his income for the 2020-21 year of income will be $32,000. On 1 November 2020, Matthew makes a later estimate, his partial year income amount for the period 1 November 2020 to 30 June 2021 (242 days) is estimated to be $26,500. On 1 April 2021, Matthew makes another later estimate, his partial year income amount for the period 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 is estimated to be $12,900.


Step 1: Calculate the daily rate that applied for each income election made in the year of income (except the last income estimate for the year which ended on 30 June). If the income estimate commenced:

• on 1 July, divide the amount by 365, or
• after 1 July, divide the amount by the number of days in the remaining period (3.4.2) to which the income estimate related.

First estimate (1 July 2020 to 31 October 2020):$32,000 ÷ 365 = $87.67123


Second estimate (1 November 2020 to 31 March 2021):$26,500 ÷ 242 = $109.50413


First estimate application period is:123 days × $87.67123 = $10,784


Second estimate application period is:151 days × $109.50413 = $16,535


Last partial year income amount (1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021):$12,900


Step 3 estimated ATI = $27,319


Total estimated ATI = $40,219


Last partial year income amount (5 April 2021 to 30 June 2021):$11,000


Step 3 estimated ATI = $2,898


Total estimated ATI = $13,898


Act reference:CSA Actsection 64A(3) Estimated ATI amount


## Reconciling an income estimate


After the end of the year of income, the Registrar will compare the parent's estimated ATI with their actual ATI for the year. The income estimate is usually reconciled when the Registrar receives the parent’s tax assessment from the ATO, however, the Registrar may determine an income to reconcile an income estimate when the actual ATI is not known 12 months after the end of the year of income for the estimate election (CSA Act section 64AB).


How the income estimate is reconciled will depend on whether the:

• income estimate applied for part of, or the full year of income
• parent made a single income estimate election, or more than one income estimate election for the year of income (that is, updated their income estimate)
• Registrar receives a tax assessment within 12 months of the year of income, or if the Registrar is required to determine an ATI in order to reconcile the estimate.

If, after an income estimate is reconciled, a higher amended ATI issues from the ATO, the income estimate will be re-reconciled for that period using the higher amended ATI.


If the Registrar has amended the assessment after reviewing an income estimate, the income estimate will be reconciled only if the Registrar determines that it is appropriate to do so.


The Registrar cannot reconcile an income estimate if an income amount order is in force for any part of the application period for the income estimate. The income estimate may be reviewed and the assessment amended under CSA Act section 63A, section 63B or section 63C, if required.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 63A to section 63C Amendment of assessments, Part 5 Division 7A Reconciliation of estimates of adjusted taxable income


## Reconciling an income estimate - actual ATI is known within 12 months


### Single income election, income estimate applies to full year of income


The Registrar will reconcile the income estimate with the parent’s actual income for the full year of income. If the actual income is:

• less than the estimated income, no further action is taken
• more than the estimated income, the parent's actual income will be their ATI for the year and the assessment will be updated.

Example:Simon makes an estimate on 27 May 2020 for the year 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. Simon estimated his ATI for the year would be $32,000. Simon's 2020-21 tax assessment issues on 2 August 2021, his actual ATI is $39,000. The assessment is amended for the year using the actual income of $39,000.


Example:Alexa makes an estimate on 27 May 2020 for the year 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021. Alexa estimated her ATI for the year would be $39,000. Alexa’s 2020-21 tax assessment issues on 2 August 2021, her actual ATI is $32,000. As the tax assessment is less than the income estimate, no further action is taken.


### Single income election, income estimate applies to a part year of income


The parent’s partial year income amount is reconciled against their actual ATI for the remaining period. The Registrar will reconcile the part year income estimate by comparing the parent's:

• estimated partial year income amount, and
• actual partial year income amount – the parent’s actual ATI less their estimated year to date amount.

If the parent’s actual partial year income amount is:

• less than the estimated partial year income amount, the income estimate is reconciled and no further action is taken (the estimated partial year income amount is used)
• more than the estimated partial year income amount, the parent's actual partial year income amount will be the amount used for the application period and the assessment will be retrospectively amended to use that income. This may result in an overpayment or child support debt (Part 8) (1.1.C.90), and the application of an estimate penalty (3.4.5).

To apply the actual partial year income amount to the assessment, it needs to be annualised by:

• Step 1 - calculating the actual partial year income amount daily rate, by dividing this amount by the number of days in the application period, and
• Step 2 - multiplying the daily rate by 365.

Example:Toni makes in income estimate election on 1 November 2020, and estimates her year to date income to be $22,000 and partial year income amount for the 242-day remaining period 1 November 2020 to 30 June 2021 to be $26,500. When Toni's 2020-21 tax assessment issues, her actual ATI for the 2020-21 financial year is $56,500.

• Toni’s annualised partial year income amount is $26,500 ÷ 242 × 365 = $39,969.
• Toni’s actual partial year income amount of $34,500 ($56,500 − $22,000) is used because it is higher than her estimated partial year income amount of $26,500.
• the daily rate of the actual partial year income amount is $34,500 ÷ 242 = $142.56198.
• the annualised amount is $142.56198 × 365 = $52,035.

Toni’s assessment for the application period, 1 November to 30 June, is amended using the annualised income of $52,035.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 64 Reconciliation using a parent’s actual adjusted taxable income—single income election, section 64AA Action by Registrar following reconciliation


### More than one income election, income estimate applies to full year of income


If the parent’s actual ATI is less than or equal to the estimated ATI, no further action will be taken. The assessment will be amended if the parent’s actual ATI is higher than their total estimated ATI.


For assessments which need to be updated to reflect the higher actual ATI, the reconciliation process identifies the difference between the person's estimated income and their actual income for the year of income, and applies the correct annualised income to each application period.


The table below shows the method statement to calculate the correct income amount for each application period.


Example:Matthew made 3 estimates for the 2020-21 year of income (see previous example related to calculating Matthew’s estimated ATI). The Registrar receives Matthew’s tax assessment for 2020-21 and his actual ATI is $46,000.


Subtract Matthew’s estimated ATI from his actual ATI.


$46,000 - $40,219 = $5,781


Step 4:To calculate the actual ATI daily rate to be applied in each application period, for each income election, add the underestimated amount:

• estimated ATI daily rate for each application period (except the last), and
• for the estimated partial year income amount.

See method statement for


Act reference:CSA Actsection 64 Reconciliation using a parent’s actual adjusted taxable income—single income election, section 64AA Action by Registrar following reconciliation


### More than one income election, income estimate applies for part of a year of income


When a parent makes an election for part of the year of income and later makes one or more other income estimates for part of that year, all estimate elections will be reconciled when the parent's actual ATI for the year of income is known.


The Registrar will reconcile the part year estimate of income by comparing the parent's:

• total estimated ATI (the total of the income expected in each application period for each income estimate election for the year of income), and
• actual partial year income amount which is their actual ATI less the year to date income amount.

The assessment will be amended if the actual partial year income amount (actual ATI for the whole year minus the year to date income amount) is more than the estimated ATI amount.


Example:Nikau made 2 estimates for the 2020-21 year of income (see previous example related to calculating Nikau’s estimated ATI). The Registrar receives Nikau’s tax assessment for 2020-21 and his actual ATI is $40,000.


Calculate Nikau’s actual partial year income amount:

• $40,000 − $24,600 = $15,400.

As Nikau’s actual partial year income amount ($15,400) is higher than his estimated ATI ($13,898), the Registrar must reconcile his actual ATI for all application periods in the year of income.


Step 1: Subtract Nikau’s estimated ATI from his actual ATI amount:

• $15,400 − $13,898 = $1,502

Step 2: Calculate the additional daily rate for the whole application period:

• $1,502 ÷ 127 = $11.82962

Step 3: Calculate the underestimated amount for each income election:

• First estimate: $11.82962 × 40 days = $473
• Last estimate: $11.82962 × 87 days = $1,029

Step 4: For each income estimate, add the underestimated amount to the annualised partial year income amount:

• First estimate: $2,898 + $473 = $3,371
• Last estimate: $11,000 + $1,029 = $12,029

Step 5: Annualise the income elections for each application period:

• First estimate: ($3,371 ÷ 40) × 365 = $30,759 (daily rate of $84.27057)
• Last estimate: ($12,029 ÷ 87) × 365 = $50,467 (daily rate of $138.26641)

Step 6: Amend the assessment by applying the annualised incomes at Step 5 to the respective application periods in the year of income.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 64 Reconciliation using a parent’s actual adjusted taxable income—single income election, section 64AA Action by Registrar following reconciliation


## Reconciling using a Registrar determined ATI


The Registrar may determine an income to be used to reconcile an income estimate when the parent’s actual ATI is not known 12 months after the end of the year of income for the estimate election. If the Registrar makes a determination of the income to be used (the parent's determined ATI) to reconcile an estimate, a notice of the determination must be provided to the parent. The parent can object to the particulars of the assessment to which the determination relates (Part 10).


The estimate or estimates will be reconciled using the approaches described above in relation to if only one estimate is made, or if more than one estimate is made.


If the parent's actual ATI becomes known after the Registrar has reconciled the estimate/s using a determined ATI, and the actual income is higher than the determined ATI, the estimate/s will be reconciled using the actual income.


If the Registrar has amended the assessment as a result of reviewing the estimate under CSA Act section 63A, section 63B or section 63C, the Registrar may decide not to reconcile the estimate.

# 3.4.5 Estimate penalties


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) should take reasonable care (1.1.C.10) and use all available information to estimate their income. If their circumstances change, they should advise the Registrar of the change in circumstances and make a new estimate. The estimate reconciliation (1.1.R.20) process ensures child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are based on the most accurate income information available.


## On this page

• Estimate penalties
• Remission of estimate penalties

## Estimate penalties


A person will be required to pay an estimate penalty when the Registrar reconciles their estimate and their actual income for an estimate period is 110%, or more, of their estimated income.


The penalty is 10% of the difference between the liability based on the original estimate and the final liability based upon theATI(1.1.A.20) amount determined. An estimate penalty is a debt due to the Commonwealth.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 64A Reconciliation using a parent’s actual adjusted taxable income …


## Remission of estimate penalties


The Registrar can remit an estimate penalty, either in whole or in part, where:

• the difference between the ATI amount and the estimated income was due to anamendment of the tax legislation, or a change to a ruling or determinationunder the tax legislation, or
• the Registrar is satisfied that it would befair and reasonable to remit the penalties in the circumstances.

### Amendment of a tax law, ruling or determination


When making an estimate, a parent cannot be expected to know that a change to the tax legislation or a change to a ruling or determination will increase their ATI.


Example:If an expense that was deductible in previous years is no longer deductible, a parent's taxable income (1.1.T.20) may be higher than their estimate by the amount of the deduction.


This does not apply where a parent's taxable income is amended for other reasons (for example, taxpayer error).


### Fair & reasonable to remit the penalties in the circumstances


What is fair and reasonable depends on the circumstances of each case. Those circumstances do not need to be special, exceptional or unusual. Estimate penalties will be remitted if the Registrar considers the parent did not intentionally misuse the estimate provisions to defer payment.


The Registrar will consider whether a parent was or should have been aware of the conditions and implications of using an estimate.


A parent should use reasonable care and all information available to estimate their income. If their circumstances change, they should make a new estimate or advise the Registrar of the change in circumstances. The Registrar may not remit an estimate penalty unless a parent has a reasonable explanation for failing to make a new estimate when their circumstances changed.


Failure to mitigate the effects of the incorrect estimate income does not necessarily mean that the parent intended to misuse the estimate provisions. However, if a parent acts to mitigate the effects this could indicate that they did not intend to avoid or defer the liability.


Example:Logan becomes aware of the difference between their estimated income and their actual ATI. Logan contacts Services Australia for advice and arranges to pay the arrears (1.1.A.100) that will result from a reconciliation of the estimate. Logan has attempted to mitigate the effect of the underestimation. The Registrar will consider this when deciding whether to remit the estimate penalty imposed.


The Registrar will remove any penalty that has been imposed incorrectly (for example, through error or miscalculation, or by a subsequent variation which decreases the liability).

# 3.5.2 Post-separation income special circumstances


## Content


Whether there are special circumstances to justify backdating the exclusion of additional income will depend on the facts in each particular case. Generally the Registrar will be satisfied special circumstances exist where the parent (1.1.P.10) was prevented from applying earlier but did apply in a timely way once they were able to, generally within 28 days.


The following are the circumstances in which a parent will be considered to have been prevented from applying earlier:

• The income was not yet used in the assessment.
• The parent was not aware of the existence of thechild support assessment (1.1.C.70).provision because it was not discussed in their initial contact with Services Australia after the application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) was accepted.
• child support assessment (1.1.C.70).
• provision because it was not discussed in their initial contact with Services Australia after the application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) was accepted.
• The parent was a victim of family violence.
• The parent (or a family member) was ill or had an accident that stopped the parent from applying.
• The parent suffered a personal trauma such as a death in the family, or a natural disaster that caused damage to their property.
• The parent had communication difficulties because of, or including, isolation, illiteracy or poor English-language skills.
• The parents were involved in negotiations over child support (1.1.C.60) and/or other matters and applying may have compromised those negotiations.
• There are other exceptional circumstances.

The exclusion will remain in place until the end of theCSP(1.1.C.150) in which the application is lodged. However, it will end sooner if the 3-year time limit (since separation) expires within that CSP.


A new application can be lodged for the next CSP if the other requirements are met and the 3-year time limit has not expired.

# 3.5.1 Post-separation income - additional income & time limits


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) can apply to havePSI(1.1.P.90) (additional income) that was earned, derived or received after separation excluded from theirATI(1.1.A.20) (3.1.1) in certain circumstances. A parent may apply to have additional income excluded, regardless of whether they pay or receive child support (1.1.C.60).

• Additional income
• The ordinary course of events
• 30% limit for reduction of ATI
• 3 year limit on excluding additional income
• When does a determination to exclude additional income apply?

## Application for PSI to be excluded


A parent may apply for additional income to be excluded from their ATI if the following requirements are met:

• the parents lived together (2.1.1) on a genuine domestic basis for at least 6 months
• the separation following that 6-month period occurredwithin the last 3 years, andbefore the application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) was made
• within the last 3 years, and
• before the application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) was made
• at the time of the application, the parents remain separated (1.1.S.30)
• in the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10), or in the application period (1.1.A.90) for an estimate of income (3.4), the parent earns, derives or receives additional incomein accordance with a pattern that was established after separation with the other parent, andit is reasonable to expect would not have been earned, derived, or received by the parent in the ordinary course of events.
• in accordance with a pattern that was established after separation with the other parent, and
• it is reasonable to expect would not have been earned, derived, or received by the parent in the ordinary course of events.

Act reference:CSA Actsection 44(1) Application for post‑separation income to be excluded


## Additional income


Additional income to be excluded is income that was earned, derived or received in a pattern established after separation. Parents may earn additional income from a variety of sources, including from overtime, a second job, a career change to a higher paying job, or from investment income.


For a self-employed parent, additional income may be earned, derived or received through extending the opening hours of their business, increasing production or developing new markets or new products (to a greater extent than before separation). The parent must be able to show that the change which resulted in the additional income being earned happened after separation.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 44(1)(d)(i) Application for post‑separation income to be excluded


## The ordinary course of events


Not all additional income that is earned, derived or received after separation will qualify for exclusion from a parent's ATI. The new pattern of earnings must have been established after separation and would not have been reasonable to expect that income in the ordinary course of events.


Additional income that parents would have been reasonably expected to earn in the ordinary course of events cannot be excluded from their ATI. For example, it is within the ordinary course of events that parents will earn additional income through regular pay rises, or seasonal variations in income, or moving from an unemployment benefit to employment.


Additional, income that parents earn outside the ordinary course of events is able to be excluded from their ATI. This could include, for example, income from overtime or second jobs taken on after separation, a cashing out of leave entitlements, promotions or a shift to a higher paying job.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 44(1)(d)(ii) Application for post‑separation income to be excluded


## 30% limit for reduction of ATI


The exclusion of additional income cannot reduce a parent's ATI by more than 30%. If excluding all the additional income earned post separation would reduce the ATI by more than 30%, the Registrar can only reduce the ATI by 30%.


Example:Lesley has an income of $30,000 at the date of separation from Irena in May 2021. From June 2021, Lesley's income increases to $60,000 as Lesley takes on a second job.


In August 2022, Lesley lodges her tax return for 2021-22 and her child support liability is assessed on an ATI of $60,000, as that was Lesley's income for the last relevant year of income (2021-22 financial year). Lesley applies to have additional income earned post separation excluded from her ATI of $60,000.


If Lesley's application is successful, Lesley's current income used in the assessment, $60,000, can only be reduced by a maximum of 30%, or $18,000. Therefore, Lesley's ATI would be set at $42,000.


Lesley could not have the full additional income of $30,000 excluded from her ATI as this would be more than 30% of ATI.


In certain circumstances, the parent's new ATI, after excluding the additional income, will be lower than their income at the date of separation.


Example:Abdul has an income of $50,000 at the date of separation from Neela in December 2021. From January 2022, Abdul takes on a new role which increases his annual income by $10,000, as stated by his employer.


In August 2022, Abdul lodges his tax return for the 2021-22 financial year, which includes $1,000 of work-related deductions for his new role (for example, vehicle and travel expenses and home office expenses). Abdul's resulting ATI is $59,000 and this is applied to his child support assessment (1.1.C.70).


Abdul applies to have the additional income of $10,000 earned post separation excluded from his ATI. Abdul's application is successful and the extra $10,000 is excluded from the assessment. The $10,000 is less than a 30% reduction in Abdul's ATI of $59,000. As a result, Abdul's ATI is now assessed at $49,000, which is less than Abdul's income of $50,000 at separation.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 44(3)(a) Application for post‑separation income to be excluded


## 3-year limit on excluding additional income


Additional income cannot be excluded for more than 3 years from the date of separation.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 44(3)(b) Application for post‑separation income to be excluded


## When does a determination to exclude additional income apply?


If the Registrar accepts an application to exclude additional income this will ordinarily apply from the date the application was made. However, it can apply from the start of theCSP(1.1.C.150) in which the application is made if there are special circumstances.

# 3.5.3 Post-separation income revoking election & review rights


## Revoking election to exclude additional income


Once an election to exclude additional income has been accepted, it cannot be revoked.


If a parent (1.1.P.10) no longer wants the exclusion to apply, they may consider making a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement setting the relevant parent's income at a higher level or specifying an annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support.


See6.1for more information on child support agreements.


## Review rights


If the Registrar refuses aPSIapplication, the Registrar will give the parent written notice of the decision. If a parent is dissatisfied with this decision, they may object to the particulars of the unchanged assessment.


If the Registrar accepts an application for exclusion of additional income the Registrar will give effect to the determination by amending any administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) that has been made in relation to theCSP(1.1.C.150) or income estimate (1.1.I.20) period. A parent who is dissatisfied with that decision may object to the particulars of the amended assessment.

# 4.1.3 Care periods & pattern of care


## Context


When an application for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is received, or a change in care percentage (1.1.C.20) is being considered, the Registrar will ask for information about the care (1.1.C.10) of the child or children.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5 Interpretation


## On this page

• What is a care period?
• Pattern of care
• Supporting evidence
• Conflicting information or disputed facts

## What is a care period?


A care period is the period over which care is assessed to determine the care percentages for each parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer.


A care period is generally a 12-month period from the day on which the actual care of a child began or changed (the date of event). The same care arrangements will be assumed to apply for the subsequent 12-month period, unless otherwise advised.


There are some circumstances where determining the care over a shorter or longer care period may be more appropriate. The Registrar will consider the specific circumstances of each case to determine the appropriate care period.


### Care periods longer than 12 months


A care period of more than 12 months might be appropriate where the parents have an arrangement in which the care of the child follows a recurring cycle over a period greater than 12 months.


Example:Martin and Cassie have one child, Priscila. Martin and Cassie have a parenting plan which provides Martin with care of Priscila every Saturday night and half of each of the school holiday periods except Christmas.


Martin and Cassie alternate care of Priscila over Christmas such that Priscila stays with Martin for all of the Christmas school holidays one year and then with Cassie for all of the Christmas school holidays the next year.


Depending on which parent has care of Priscila during the Christmas school holidays, both Martin and Cassie's care percentage would change each year if the care was determined over a care period of 12 months. In this case, it would be appropriate to consider a care period of 24 months to properly account for the alternating pattern of care for the Christmas school holidays.


### Care periods shorter than 12 months


A care period of less than 12 months may be appropriate where the pattern of care will gradually change over a definable period of less than 12 months in a specific and measurable way.


Example:Leroy and Lesley have one child, Alfreda. There is no care arrangement in place for Alfreda, however, Leroy is currently assessed to have 100% care of Alfreda. Leroy's circumstances change such that Leroy is no longer able to care for Alfreda full time. Leroy asks Lesley if Alfreda can live with them until Leroy is able to resume caring for the child. Lesley agrees but says that they will not be able to do this permanently due to their travel commitments for work.


Leroy and Lesley come to an informal arrangement that Leroy will look after Alfreda one night per week for the next 2 months, and then will increase their care by one night per week every 2 months thereafter until Leroy resumes full time care of Alfreda.


Lesley calls Services Australia to advise of the new arrangement. Because the parents have come to a specific arrangement to increase Leroy's care in a staggered but foreseeable way over a definable period, it would be appropriate to use a care period of 2 months for each of the periods that Leroy is due to increase their care of Alfreda. This ensures the care percentage accurately reflects the care that each parent is providing during each 2-month period.


Determining the care percentages over a care period of less than 12 months may also be appropriate where a parent's pattern of care is set out in a care arrangement between the parents over a definable period of less than 12 months and the actual care is occurring in accordance with that care arrangement.


Example:Vishal and Martha have one child, Caitlin. There is a care arrangement in place for Caitlin which states that Vishal and Martha are to share the care of Caitlin equally for the next 6 months. At the conclusion of the 6 months, the parents agree to come to a new care arrangement. The Registrar will determine the care percentages for Vishal and Martha using the 6-month care period provided in the care arrangement.


## Pattern of care


In many circumstances, the Registrar will require information about the pattern of care that each parent has of the children. Minor departures from the normal care of the child, such as missing a weekend of care due to illness or work, will not constitute a change to the pattern of care, and will not result in a new care determination.


The Registrar must make a determination of the care a parent or non-parent carer is likely to have, or has had, of the child during the relevant care period. In making a determination, the Registrar may use or request information about past care to form a judgment about likely future care. In doing this, the Registrar may consider patterns of care that have been established in recent months if it is satisfied that the pattern is likely to continue.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 49 Determination of percentage of care—responsible person has had etc. no pattern of care for a child, section 50 Determination of percentage of care—responsible person has had etc. a pattern of care for a child


## Supporting evidence


Parties may be able to support their claims by providing records of the care provided for the children. The Registrar will consider a wide range of evidence, including records of visits to health care providers, other services, or diary entries. The Registrar may also have records of past contact with the parent or carer that is relevant and can also use Centrelink information.


The Registrar can consider statements provided by third parties. The Registrar will advise the third party and the parent who provided the statement that the other parent will be told the source and details of the information contained in the statement so that they can comment. If the third party or parent providing the information does not want the details provided to the other parent, the Registrar will not consider the statement when making a decision.


The Registrar will respect the privacy of the parents and the children involved. The Registrar will not contact third parties without the consent of the parent who provided the information and will not imply that the third party is obliged to provide information to the Registrar. If a parent provides a written statement from a third party, the Registrar will infer that they have consented to the third party being contacted.


## Conflicting information or disputed facts


The information given to the Registrar by a parent or carer regarding the care being provided for a child may be in conflict with the information provided by the other parent or carer. The Registrar encourages parents to resolve between themselves any disputes they may have about the care arrangements for a child. However, it is recognised that sometimes parents do not agree about the care that each parent has of the child, and as a result the Registrar cannot immediately determine a care percentage to be used in an assessment. In these cases, the Registrar will request additional information or supporting evidence of the claims made by each parent.


If parents provide conflicting information, the Registrar will give each parent the opportunity to comment on the information provided by the other parent before a determination is made. If the facts regarding the care arrangements are disputed, the Registrar will attempt to determine a new percentage of care of a child on the basis of the information provided and obtained. If the information and evidence provided by the parents cannot be reconciled, the Registrar will weigh the evidence and information provided by the parents to determine the pattern of care likely to occur over the care period.


The Registrar may use or request information about past care to form a judgment about likely future care. The Registrar will make a decision on the basis of the information provided by the parents to substantiate their claims.


In rare circumstances, the information provided by the parents or carers may be inconclusive to the extent that the Registrar is unable to determine what care percentage each parent or carer is likely to have over the relevant care period. In these cases, the Registrar will assume that the state of affairs known at the time the existing care determination was made is continuing. As there is no change in the care percentage, the existing care determination cannot be revoked and the child support assessment will not be amended.

# 4 Care


## Introduction


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent’s percentage of care (1.1.P.70) is used in the child support formula (1.1.C.110) to calculate the rate of child support (1.1.C.60) payable.


This chapter explains how the Registrar will determine care (1.1.C.10) of a child, including when care is disputed. This chapter also provides information about interim care rules.


Parents can use the onlineChild Support care estimatorto estimate the care percentage for their child support assessment (1.1.C.70).

# 4.1 Overview of care


## Context


Child support assessments (1.1.C.70) are generally based on the child support formula (1.1.C.110), which calculates how much child support (1.1.C.60) is payable by considering each parent’s (1.1.P.10) income, and the number, age, and care arrangement in place for each child in the assessment.


This topic outlines the policy for determining care (1.1.C.10) as used in the child support formula to calculate the rate of child support.

# 4.1.6 Care arrangement


## Context


For child support (1.1.C.60) purposes, a care arrangement and a written agreement for care (1.1.C.10) of a child has the same meaning used for family assistance purposes (FA Guide1.1.C.05).


A document that acknowledges that care is occurring in a particular way does not constitute a written agreement, even if it is signed by both parties. The written agreement must indicate that the care arrangement constitutes an agreed, ongoing care arrangement for the child.


Disputed care (1.1.D.70) is different from situations where there is disagreement about the facts regarding the care of a child, whether or not a care arrangement is in place for the child. See4.1.5for information about how the Registrar deals with conflicting information or disputed facts about a care arrangement.


Act reference:FAActsection 3 Definitions


FL Actsection 63C Meaning of parenting plan and related terms, 64B Meaning of parenting order and related terms, section 70D Registration of orders in a particular State, section 70G Registration of orders


## Situations where there is no care arrangement


A care arrangement does not exist where parents (1.1.P.10) only have a verbal agreement for the care of a child. Where there is no care arrangement in place for the care of the child, an interim period will not apply.


In cases where individuals are in dispute about care and they do not have a care arrangement in place, the care in the assessment will be based on the actual level of care each parent is providing. Similarly, if a non-parent carer was caring for a child on the basis of a verbal understanding with the child's parent, an interim period would not apply if the child returned to live with their parent against the wishes of the non-parent carer.

# 4.1.2 Care definitions for child support assessments


## Context


Once a percentage of care (1.1.P.70) has been determined, there are 5 different terms that may be used to describe care (1.1.C.10) (see table below). These terms are not used to describe the ‘role’ of either parent (1.1.P.10).


The care range for a child may influence other decisions.

• prescribed non agency payments (7.5.2)
• if a parent should pay theMAR(2.3.4) (1.1.M.20)
• if a parent should pay theFAR(2.3.5) (1.1.F.10)
• some applications for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50). In particular, the parent's percentage of care may impact upon the costs that can be claimed in an application under Reason 1 - high costs in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, a child (5.2.1).

# 4.1.1 Basics of care


## Context


This page outlines the factors the Registrar considers when determining care (1.1.C.10) for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes, and the types of care determinations that can be made.


## On this page

• Determining whether care exists
• Types of care determinations

## Determining whether care exists


An object of the Child Support Scheme is 'that persons who provide ongoing daily care for children should be able to have the level of financial support to be provided for the children readily determined without the need to resort to court proceedings'. The CSA Act does not define the term 'ongoing daily care', however the Registrar will take into account a number of factors in determining whether a person cares for a child.


In most cases, it will be relatively clear whether and to what extent a person is caring for a child and care will generally be worked out based on the number of nights that the child is likely to be, or has been, in the care of the person during the care period. Where there is doubt, the Registrar will consider whichever of the following are relevant to the particular case, based on the extent to which the:

• person has control of the child, including having overall responsibility for the child and makingmajor decisions relating to who the child spends time with, and the child's health, education, discipline, recreational and/or social activities, andarrangements for others to meet the needs of the child (delegated care)
• major decisions relating to who the child spends time with, and the child's health, education, discipline, recreational and/or social activities, and
• arrangements for others to meet the needs of the child (delegated care)
• person meets the needs of the child by providing the child with accommodation, clothing, food, childcare, education, health care, emotional support, supervision, transport and extra-curricular activities
• person pays for the costs of meeting the needs of, or otherwise provides financial support for, the child
• child provides for his or her own needs or has those needs met from another source
• child is financially independent or financially supported from another source.

Where parents are separated (1.1.S.30) but living in the same house, the Registrar will determine each parent's percentage of care (1.1.P.70) for a child based on the individual circumstances of the case and evidence available. Generally, where the parents contribute in a similar manner to the care of the child, they will be regarded as sharing equally in the care of the child. In this case, the Registrar will determine that each parent has a care percentage of 50%. This care percentage will remain in place until either parent is able to demonstrate that the actual care of the child is something other than equally shared.


Additionally, in limited circumstances, a person may have care of a child who is not living with them for a period of time. For example, a person can provide care for a child who is at boarding school, in hospital, or in separate accommodation. However, a person who simply supervises the child (for example, a baby sitter, a child minder such as a grandparent or a schoolteacher) does not provide care. Consideration is given to who has responsibility for making arrangements for, and decisions about, the child's welfare, as well as who is meeting the child's costs, rather than just the accommodation arrangements themselves. The Registrar will give weight to statements from both parents and any non-parent carers.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 4 Objects of Act, section 54A Working out actual care, and extent of care, of a child


## Types of care determinations


When determining a percentage of care, the Registrar can make the following types of determinations:

• a determination of the percentage of the actual care that each parent provides
• a determination, for an interim period (4.2), of a percentage of care based on a written agreement, parenting plan, or court order rather than on the actual care, in certain circumstances where care is disputed, or
• a below regular care (1.1.B.20) determination (4.1.7), where a person's care falls below 14% despite the child being made available to the person.

The Registrar will usually determine a percentage of care based on the actual care that each parent or non-parent carer has of the child. The only circumstance in which the Registrar will not use actual care to determine the care percentage is in limited circumstances where a parent or non-parent carer is not complying with a written agreement, court order or parenting plan and an interim care determination is in effect (disputed care arrangement).


When the Registrar is notified or otherwise becomes aware that the care for a child has changed, the previous determination will be revoked. A new care determination will be made according to the circumstances. If the Secretary has made a care determination forFTBpurposes in relation to the change, the Registrar will use that determination (4.3).

# 4.1.4 Care other than in nights


## Context


Generally, the number of nights a person cares for a child will be the best measure of their percentage of care (1.1.P.70). However, there may be some occasions where only counting the nights in care does not accurately reflect the caring arrangements for the child. For example, one parent (1.1.P.10) may provide care (1.1.C.10) every night while the other parent provides care from 8 am to 6 pm every weekday.


In such cases, the Registrar may calculate the number of hours of care for each carer in determining the pattern of care and convert that into a care percentage. The Registrar will take into account the information from each parent or non-parent carer about the care they provide and why they think nights or hours is the better measure of care.


Example:Camryn and Capricia have one child Viktor. Camryn works night shifts and so can only provide care for Viktor during the daytime. Camryn cares for Viktor for 45 hours per week while Capricia cares for Viktor every night. A percentage of care based on nights would not properly reflect the parents' care arrangements for Viktor and the Registrar would therefore determine the percentages of care based on the hours that each parent provides care for Viktor.


Example:Albert and Daria have one child, Ahmed. Albert has 98% care of Ahmed and Daria has 2% care based on the number of nights care over a 12-month care period. During the 12-month care period, Ahmed stays 7 Saturday nights (from 4 pm Saturday to 12 noon on Sunday) with Daria and the rest of the nights with Albert. Daria works night shifts and takes care of Ahmed every weekday from 8 am until Albert returns from work at 6 pm. This occurs for 40 weeks over 12 months. Daria requests that their care percentage be calculated using hourly care.

• Saturday nights: 7 × 20 hours = 140 hours
• Daytime care: 5 weekdays × 40 weeks × 10 hours = 2,000 hours
• Total hours care: 2,140 hours
• Care percentage: 2,140 hours ÷ 8,760 hours = 24%

Even where a determination based on the hours of care that a person provides might result in a different percentage of care to a determination based on the nights of care, it may still be more appropriate to use nights of care as the best measure of care that the person provides.


If a person has some overnight care and a small amount of additional 'daytime' care that is not associated with an overnight stay, it may still be more appropriate to use a care percentage calculation based on nights. A decision as to whether nights are an appropriate basis for a care percentage determination will depend on the particular circumstances of the case.


Example:Leif and Kayley have 2 children, Emmett and Matti, who live mainly with Leif. Kayley has care of the children every second Friday and Saturday night and some school holidays. Kayley also picks the children up from school on Wednesdays, takes them to soccer and has dinner with them, before dropping them back to Leif's house for the night. As the daytime care Kayley provides each Wednesday does not significantly affect the care arrangements, it is appropriate to base the percentages of care on the nights of care that each parent has of the children.

# 4.1.5 Care determinations & changes in care


## Context


When considering whether to make a new care determination, the Registrar will consider whether there has been a change to the existing pattern of care. If there has been a change to the pattern of care, the Registrar will need to identify the event that is relevant. The event is used to determine the commencement of the care period (4.1.3). The Registrar will need to determine the percentage of care that is likely to occur in the care period.


All of the care provisions discussed in this topic relate to relevant dependent children (1.1.R.60) as well as children of a child support assessment. See2.5.4for the rules that identify the date to be used when first adding a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) to an assessment.


## On this page

• When can a new percentage of care be determined?
• Change in pattern of care
• No pattern of care - point of agreement
• No pattern of care - no change to the assessment
• One-off block of 100% care
• Date of effect of a care change
• Increased or decreased care percentage
• Multiple care change notifications or care advised out of order
• Review of care decisions
• Older children living away from home

## When can a new percentage of care be determined?


A new percentage of care (1.1.P.70) can be determined whenever the care of a child has changed (section 54F to section 54HA). The Registrar will not give effect to future expected care changes until either of the parents advise the Registrar that the anticipated change has actually occurred. If neither parent advises the Registrar when the care subsequently changes, a new care percentage determination will not be made. The child support assessment will continue to be based upon the existing care percentage until one or both of the parents advise the Registrar that the actual care has changed, and the Registrar is able to make a new care percentage determination.


The Registrar can only give effect to a new care percentage determination after revoking the existing care percentage determination (section 49(1)(b)(i) and section 50(1)(b)(i)). The new care percentage determination takes effect the day after the existing determination is revoked. There are several circumstances in which the existing determination can be revoked:

• where a new care percentage determination would affect the cost percentage (1.1.C.200) (section 54F)
• where, under a new care percentage determination, one of the parties who was previously assessed to have at least regular care (1.1.R.50) of the child would now be determined to have below regular care (1.1.B.20) despite the child being made available by the other party (section 54G), and
• where a new care percentage determination, if it was to be made, would affect the care percentage (but not the cost percentage) (section 54H).

Whether the Registrar revokes an existing care percentage determination under section 54H will depend on the circumstances of the case. If a party to an assessment advises the Registrar of a change in care that would not affect the cost percentage and seeks to have the change reflected on the Register, the Registrar should revoke the existing care percentage determination if there is evidence provided by each party, or evidence which is otherwise readily available, to allow the Registrar to determine new care percentages. This helps to ensure there is an accurate record of the care history on a case. However, if a party does not agree that a change has occurred or the readily available evidence is otherwise not conclusive as to the precise care percentages, the Registrar may decide not to revoke the existing determination and conduct no further investigations. This discretion enables the Registrar to decide to not proceed with unnecessary investigations to determine precise care percentages that would not make a material difference to the assessment.


Example:John and Sarah have one child, Michelle, for whom John has regular care of 14% and Sarah has primary care of 86%. John calls Services Australia to advise that his care percentage of Michelle has increased from 14% care to 25% care. Services Australia explains that this change, if confirmed, will not affect the amount of child support payable, but John wishes to have the change reflected on the Register. Services Australia contacts the other parent, Sarah, who confirms that John's care of Michelle has increased from 14% care to 25% care. Even though John's increased level of care of Michelle is still within the regular care range and will therefore not affect the cost percentage, the Registrar is satisfied that John's new care percentage of Michelle is 25% and decides to revoke the existing care percentage determination to enable a new care percentage determination to be made that reflects John's 25% care of Michelle.


Example:Melanie and Josh have one child, Amy, for whom Melanie has below regular care of 8% and Josh has above primary care of 92%. Melanie calls Services Australia to advise that her care percentage of Amy has increased from 8% care to 12% care. Services Australia explains that this change, if confirmed, will not affect the amount of child support payable. Melanie doesn't want the change reflected on the Register if it will not affect the assessment. Services Australia decides not to conduct further investigations, and makes a decision to not revoke the existing care percentage determination.


Example:Sally and Marco have one child, Lincoln, for whom Sally has regular care of 14% and Marco has primary care of 86%. Sally calls Services Australia to advise that her care percentage of Lincoln has increased from 14% care to 25% care. Services Australia contacts the other parent, Marco, who advises that Sally's care of Lincoln has only increased from 14% care to 20% care. Each parent has provided a statement of their care levels and Services Australia is satisfied on the basis of this evidence that Sally's level of care of Lincoln has increased from 14% care and remains within the regular care range. However, the current evidence does not enable Services Australia to be satisfied as to the specific new percentage of care. There would be no change to the cost percentage from a new care percentage determination. Services Australia decides not to conduct further investigations or seek further evidence, and makes a decision to not revoke the existing care percentage determination.


For the purposes of section 54F to section 54HA, where an interim period has been in place, revocation of the existing care determination can occur if:

• the maximum interim period has ended, or
• the maximum interim period has not ended, if there has been a change to the actual care of the child during a period where the interim period does not apply (see4.2for more information on disputed care).

Act reference:CSA Actsection 54F Determination must be revoked if there is a change to the responsible person’s cost percentage, section 54FA Suspension of determination before the end of the maximum interim period if there is a change to the responsible person’s cost percentage, section 54G Determination must be revoked if there is less than regular care etc., section 54H Registrar may revoke a determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care, section 54HA Suspension of determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care before the end of the maximum interim period


## Change in pattern of care


What constitutes a change to the pattern of care will depend upon the individual circumstances of the case. In cases where a person's care percentage would drop below 14%, the Registrar may make a below regular care (1.1.B.20) determination. The Registrar will consider all the information provided to determine if there has been a change in the pattern of care.


Example:Marissa and Ryan are the parents of 2 children. The children live mainly with Marissa. Ryan has care every Saturday night, some Friday nights and some holiday care, totalling 92 nights (or 25%) over the course of a year.


Ryan calls Services Australia on 22 March advising he now has more care of the children, as the children are spending every Friday night with him. Marissa confirms the children are staying with Ryan every Friday night so they can attend Little Athletics on Saturday mornings. The change happened about 6 weeks ago and is likely to continue for the rest of the school year.


The Registrar is satisfied there has been a change in the pattern of care from the first Friday when Ryan began to consistently have more care.


Not all changes in care will result in a change to the care percentage. Minor departures from the normal pattern of care for the child, such as missing a weekend of care due to illness or work, will not usually constitute a change to the pattern of care, and will not result in a new care determination.


Example:Jane and Gary are the parents of 3 children. The children live mainly with Jane. Gary has care every second Saturday night, some Friday nights and some holiday care, totalling 52 nights. This is a care percentage of 14%.


Jane calls Services Australia advising Gary did not have care as expected last Friday and Saturday. Jane states the parents have not made an agreement about the care, but, rather, the arrangements had evolved in line with their habits. Jane requests that the assessment be amended.


Gary advises he did not have care of the children due to an unexpected family situation. He anticipates the usual arrangements will resume with his next scheduled care. Jane advises she is uncertain of future care arrangements. She confirms the care arrangements have followed the same pattern for the last 2 years.


The Registrar determines that the pattern of care that was used to determine the current care percentages is likely to continue. The Registrar determines that Gary is likely to have a care percentage of 14% for the care period. As the care percentage has not changed, the assessment is not amended.


Example:Nic and Jo are the parents of 3 children. The children live mainly with Nic. Jo has care every Saturday night, some Friday nights and some holiday care, totalling 92 nights or 25%.


Jo calls Services Australia on 22 March advising that she now has more care of the children, as the children have spent the last 3 Friday nights with them. Based on these arrangements Jo will have significantly more care of the children.


Nic advises that the children have stayed with Jo for the last 3 Friday nights as Nic has been undertaking a course on those nights. There is only one more night of the course to attend and then the previous care arrangements will resume.


The Registrar is not satisfied that there has been a change in the pattern of care. The Registrar determines that the pattern of care that was used to determine the current care percentages is likely to continue. The Registrar determines that Jo is likely to have a care percentage of 25% for the care period. As the care percentage has not changed, the assessment is not amended.


## No pattern of care - point of agreement


There may be situations where the Registrar is advised that the care of a child will change, or has changed, but no pattern of care exists that will assist in determining the care percentages for a new care period. In these situations, the Registrar will consider the information provided by the parents and non-parent carers to decide whether care percentages can be determined. If the information provided by all parties is consistent, then the Registrar will determine the care percentages based on that information.


If conflicting information has been provided by the parties, the Registrar will consider whether there is some common expectation about future care. If the information provided shows that a different care percentage would be calculated, and there is agreement to a certain point on what the new care arrangements will be, then the Registrar will use that 'point of agreement' to determine the new care percentage.


Example:Mel and Faraj are the parents of 3 children. The children live mainly with Mel. Faraj has care every second Saturday night and some holiday care, totalling 42 nights or 11%.


Faraj calls Services Australia on 27 May to advise that the care of his son, Ben, has changed. Ben has just started a part time job near Faraj's home and will be staying with Faraj after work. Faraj expects that Ben will be in his care for 2 nights per week during school terms and at least 3 nights per week during school holidays. This would be a care percentage of 31% (40 × 2 = 80 and 12 × 3 = 36, a total of 116 nights).


When contacted by Services Australia, Mel confirms that the care has changed and that Ben is now spending more time with Faraj. However, Mel advises that Ben will be working and staying with Faraj 2 nights per week during school terms and 2 nights every second week of the school holidays. This is a care percentage of 25% (40 × 2 = 80 and 6 × 2 = 12, a total of 92 nights).


As the new care arrangements have only recently commenced, there is no established pattern of care for the school holidays. Both parents agree that Ben will spend at least 92 nights with Faraj. The Registrar determines, based on that 'point of agreement', that Faraj will have a care percentage of 25% and Mel will have a care percentage of 75% for Ben. The assessment is amended using these care percentages.


## No pattern of care - no change to the assessment


Where the information provided is insufficient for a pattern of care to be determined, and there is no common expectation about future care, the Registrar will assume that the percentage of care known at the time the assessment was made is continuing. As there is no change to the care percentages, the assessment will not be amended.


In making a determination, the Registrar will seek and consider information from all parties. If further information becomes available, the Registrar can consider making a new determination at that time.


## One-off block of 100% care


Where a parent or non-parent carer unexpectedly and temporarily provides 100% care of a child, the Registrar may recognise that the person has 100% care although they are not expected to continue to have that level of care. In these situations, the Registrar will determine the care over a short care period related to the unexpected circumstance. When care returns to the normal pattern, a party may notify the Registrar of the change in care, and the Registrar will consider whether to make a new care percentage determination.


The period of unexpected care will generally need to be at least 4 weeks in length in order for the Registrar to make such a determination. However, shorter periods can be considered, especially where there is a possibility the period may be extended.


Example:Jason and Anita have one child, Robyn. Robyn usually lives with Jason 100% of the time. Jason needs to go to hospital for 3 weeks for an operation, and may require a further period of intensive rehabilitation where he will not be able to care for Robyn. Anita will look after Robyn during this time. The Registrar makes a one-off block of 100% care decision. When Robyn returns to Jason's care, Jason contacts Services Australia and the Registrar makes a new care decision based on the ongoing care of each parent.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 49 Determination of percentage of care— … no pattern of care for a child, section 50 Determination of percentage of care— … a pattern of care for a child


## Date of effect of a care change


If the Registrar is notified or otherwise becomes aware of a change of care within 28 days of the change, the assessment will be amended using the new percentage of care from the date the change of care occurred (section 54F(3)(a) and section 54H(3)(a)).


The Registrar can be notified or otherwise become aware of a change of care from sources other than the parents or non-parent carers, for example, information provided by the Secretary in relation to FTB, or by a parent's authorised representative.


The parties have an obligation to notify the Registrar of increases or decreases in care. If they fail to comply with that obligation, neither party should benefit from that failure. If the Registrar is not notified or does not otherwise become aware of a change of care within 28 days of the change, and:

• the parent or non-parent carer's care has increased, the assessment will be amended using the new care percentage for that parent or non-parent carer from the date the Registrar was notified or otherwise became aware of the care change (unless care changes again prior to this date)
• the parent or non-parent carer's care has decreased, the assessment will be amended using the new care percentage for that parent or non-parent carer from the date the change of care occurred (section 54F(3)(b) and section 54H(3)(b)).

Example:Soo-Min called Services Australia on 23 January 2023 to advise of a care change that occurred on 3 January 2023. The Registrar contacted the other parent, Hyun, who confirmed that the care changed on that date. As the Registrar was notified within 28 days of the care change, the Registrar changed the parents' percentages of care and amended the assessment from 3 January 2023.


Example:Fatima advised Services Australia on 16 December 2022 that a change of care had occurred on 15 September 2022, with Fatima's care increasing to 100% and Abdul's care decreasing to 0%. The Registrar received confirmation from the other parent, Abdul, that the care changed on that date. As the Registrar was notified more than 28 days after the care change, the Registrar amended the assessment with the changed care percentages from the date of notification for Fatima's increased care (16 December 2022) and from the date of event for Abdul's decreased care (15 September 2022).


ForFTBpurposes there are different date of effect rules (FA Guide4.4.2.10).


Different rules apply to care changes that result in an interim care determination. See4.2for more information.


Different date of effect rules can apply to care changes where a person's care has fallen below 14% despite the child being made available to them and the Registrar is notified within a reasonable timeframe. See4.1.7for more information.


See2.6.4for rules on suspensions when notification has been delayed and made within 26 weeks. See2.6.3for rules on terminating events when notification has been delayed and made outside of 26 weeks.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 54F Determination must be revoked if there is a change to the responsible person’s cost percentage, section 54H Registrar may revoke a determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care


## Increased or decreased care percentage


When determining the date of effect of a care change, the Registrar must first determine if a parent or non-parent carer's care has increased or decreased (section 54F(3)(b) and section 54H(3)(b)). The Registrar will determine if a parent or non-parent carer's care has increased or decreased by comparing it to the care used in the child support assessment, for that parent or non-parent carer, on the day the care changed.


The date of the care change will be the point of comparison even if a later care change is used in the assessment prior to the Registrar being notified of the care change currently being applied.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 54F Determination must be revoked if there is a change to the responsible person’s cost percentage, section 54H Registrar may revoke a determination of a responsible person’s percentage of care


## Multiple care change notifications or care advised out of order


Where a parent or non-parent carer delays notifying a change in the percentage of care of a child to the Registrar, they may advise more than one change in care has occurred or advise of a care change that occurred earlier than one that is already used in the assessment. The Registrar will treat each care change as a separate event and determine the percentage of care for each care event as though subsequent care changes had not occurred.


When a care determination is made and it is one of multiple care changes or is a care change advised out of order it will have the following effect on the assessment:

• decreased care percentages will apply to the assessment from the date of the care change, and
• increased care percentages will apply to the assessment from the date of notification, if the care in the assessment doesn't change between the date of the care change and the date of notification.

When applying multiple care changes to the child support assessment, they are applied in order of event from oldest to most recent. The care percentages for the older care changes will be used when later care changes are compared to the care used in the assessment on the day the care changed.


## Review of care decisions


If a parent or carer is dissatisfied with a decision concerning the percentage of care, they may object to that decision. See10.2.8for more information on objections to care percentage decisions.


When making a decision about an objection, the Registrar will either allow it, partly allow it or disallow it. If a person is dissatisfied with the objection decision, they may seek a review of the decision in theART. See10.3for more information on applying to the ART.


Where the ART has made a decision on review of a care percentage decision a party dissatisfied with the decision may apply to the ART for second review of the decision.


Decisions on first review of a care percentage decision made by theAATprior to 14 October 2024 may still be reviewed by the ART on second review, subject to application time limits and other requirements being met (ART (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Act 2024Schedule 16, Part 4).


Where a parent or carer also receives FTB the same care percentage will be used for both child support and FTB purposes but may have a different date of effect (10.2.8).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 80A Objections against care percentage decisions may be lodged, section 89 Application for ART review


## Older children living away from home


Generally, older children who live independently and separately from their parents or carers provide for many of their own needs. This may include meeting their own ongoing daily needs (such as meal preparation, transport, socialising, etc.) as well as making their own decisions about their daily activities, schooling and health issues. Therefore, it may be difficult to establish whether a person provides care for an older child support child who lives separately from that person.


Where a person provides substantial financial support to an older child support child living away from home, the Registrar will generally consider that financial support as an indicator that the person is continuing to provide care for the child. The support can be in relation to daily costs such as food, accommodation and transport, and/or longer term costs such as school fees, paying for airfares home for holidays, clothing, health and dental care, etc.


While financial support is often a key factor in determining whether a person cares for a child who lives away from home, it will not always be the sole determinant. In cases where the financial support provided is limited, and other factors exist that suggest that the person continues to care for the child, the Registrar will consider whether the person is actively involved in major decisions relating to the child. For example, decisions relating to the child's health, schooling, relationships, career, etc. may be indicators that the person continues to provide care for the child.


Example:Rusty and Nichol have one child, Victoria, who is 16 and working part time after leaving school early. Rusty helps Victoria find a suitable flat and pays the bond so that Victoria can move closer to work. Rusty helps Victoria to pay for rent and utilities, and assists with other expenses such as buying work clothes and arranging and paying for medical appointments. Rusty also helps Victoria with decisions about things like finding alternative study options for further education. Every weekend Rusty does Victoria's laundry and provides cooked meals for the week. The Registrar would determine that Rusty continues to care for Victoria for child support purposes despite Victoria living separately from Rusty.


Example:Marian and Jaquie have one child, Judy, who is 17 and working as an apprentice. Judy decides to rent a room in a share house. Jaquie helps Judy move in and pays the cost of petrol on the occasions Judy comes back for a visit. Jaquie also makes deposits into Judy's bank account every now and then if Judy needs some extra cash to make ends meet. Judy pays for rent, utilities and any other expenses, and shares in household chores including meal preparation and cleaning. Unless there were other relevant factors, the Registrar would determine that Judy is living independently and Jaquie does not care for Judy for child support purposes.

# 4.1.7 Below regular care determinations


## Context


Most care (1.1.C.10) decisions where a parent's (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer's care has fallen below 14% are made according to the rules set out in4.1.5. The rules set out on this page apply where a person's care falls below 14% despite the child being made available to that person. It can only be appropriate for the date of effect of the decision to be backdated by more than 28 days from the date of notification if the parent or carer with care of the child notified the Registrar of the care change in a reasonable timeframe from becoming aware of the care change.


## Act reference


CSA Actsection 49, section 50, section 54G, section 54F


## On this page

• When a below regular care determination will be made
• Making the child available
• Date of effect of a below regular care determination
• Reasonable period of time
• Never established a pattern of care
• Ceases a pattern of care
• Notification not made within a reasonable period of time

## When a below regular care determination will be made


A below regular care (1.1.B.20) determination will be made when:

• the Registrar had previously determined (based on actual care) that a person was to have at least regular care (1.1.R.50) of a child over a given care period (CSA Act section 50)
• that person has had a pattern of care that amounted to less than regular care, or has had no care, of the child despite the child being made available to them by the other parent or non-parent carer involved in the case
• the other parent or non-parent carer in the case has a pattern of care as determined by the Registrar (section 50), and
• the other parent or non-parent carer notifies the Registrar or Secretary that the person has had no care, or has had below regular care and the Registrar is satisfied that the notification has been made within a reasonable period, based on the circumstances of the case.

Example:Jean and Marie have an informal arrangement where Jean mostly cares for their child, Isabel, and Marie has most of the school holidays. The Registrar has made a decision that Marie is likely to have 19% care (about 70 nights) of Isabel.


Marie does not have care over the spring holidays, but tells Jean that things will be back to normal for the summer holidays. When the summer holidays start and Marie indicates that they will not have care then either, Jean realises that the pattern of care has changed, and contacts Services Australia within a reasonable time. The Registrar considers the information from both parents and makes a below regular care decision as Marie is likely to have 0% care according to the information provided.


The date of event is when Marie's pattern of care changed - at the start of the spring holidays. Because Jean could not have reasonably known that the pattern was changing until the start of the summer holidays, it is appropriate for the decision to have effect from the date of event, despite Jean notifying the Registrar of the change more than 28 days after the change occurred. The Registrar makes a below regular care determination effective from the date of event, that is, the start of the spring holidays.


## Making the child available


A below regular care determination can only be made if a parent or non-parent carer has no care, or a pattern of less than regular care, of a child despite the child being made available to them by the other parent or non-parent carer in the assessment (section 49, section 50 and section 54G(1)(b)).


The Registrar will be satisfied that a child is being made available if both parties confirm that the child was made available. When this is disputed the Registrar will need to consider a variety of factors, which may include:

• the actions taken by the parent/non-parent carer with increased care, and
• if both parties are genuinely attempting to facilitate care, whether the child is refusing to have the planned care.

A parent or non-parent carer should make a child available for care to take place. The parent or non-parent carer with more care should be encouraging the contact and requiring the child to see the other party. They should be facilitating the care by providing reasonable transport and communication options (for example, phone and internet), and not be organising or encouraging alternative activities that would prevent or hinder the care. Their actions should include:

• dropping the child off as agreed
• having the child ready to be picked up as agreed
• taking the child to the agreed exchange location
• encouraging the child to see the other parent, including, particularly for older children, facilitating communication between the child and the other parent to enable contact to occur, and
• not making conflicting appointments or arrangements for the child, for example, booking swimming or music lessons that limit the other party's ability to have care.

Evidence of a parent or non-parent carer's action could include a written account of the steps they have taken to make the child available.


In some cases, the choice or actions of the child may prevent care from occurring as anticipated despite the genuine attempts of one or multiple parties. The Registrar will generally only be satisfied that it is the child's action that is preventing care from occurring when the child is 15 years or older (although in some circumstances younger children will be considered). The choice of the child does not remove the requirement for the other parent or carer to make the child available to the person who was to have regular care of the child in the case. If this has not occurred then a below regular care determination under section 54G cannot be made and the ordinary rules outlined in4.1.5will apply.


Note:If the Registrar is satisfied that a child has been made available for the purposes of a below regular care determination under section 54G, then it is unlikely that an interim period could apply to the relevant care change. See4.2for further information.


## Date of effect of a below regular care determination


The date of effect of a below regular care determination will depend on whether a pattern of regular care was established and subsequently ceased, or was never established.


## Reasonable period of time


The Registrar will generally be satisfied that a parent or non-parent carer notified the Registrar within a reasonable period if they notified the Registrar within 28 days of becoming aware that:

• the other parent or non-parent carer never established the pattern of at least regular care, or
• the other parent or non-parent carer ceased their established pattern of at least regular care.

If the parent or non-parent carer notifies the Registrar more than 28 days after becoming aware of the above care events, the individual circumstances of the case will be considered.


## Never established a pattern of care


If a parent or non-parent carer notifies the Registrar within a reasonable period of time that another party never established a pattern of regular care, despite the child being made available, the new care percentages resulting from the below regular care determination will have effect from the first day that the care percentage of 14% or over was used in the assessment. Where the parent who never established a pattern of care has a liability to the other parent or non-parent carer, arrears will generally result.


A parent or non-parent carer will not have established a pattern of care if they never have care in accordance with an expected pattern. The Registrar will consider the circumstances of the individual case. The Registrar will generally consider that a pattern was not established if, from the date the pattern of care was to start:

• the parent or non-parent carermissed 3 consecutive expected care eventsmissed 5 care events out of 8 expected, ormissed 20% of the expected nights of care over 12 months (when calculating 20% the Registrar will not include an isolated event that is clearly not a change in the pattern), and
• missed 3 consecutive expected care events
• missed 5 care events out of 8 expected, or
• missed 20% of the expected nights of care over 12 months (when calculating 20% the Registrar will not include an isolated event that is clearly not a change in the pattern), and
• they had not yet had3 consecutive events5 events out of 8, or20% of the expected nights of care over 12 months.
• 3 consecutive events
• 5 events out of 8, or
• 20% of the expected nights of care over 12 months.

For the purposes of below regular care determinations, a care event is a night of care or several consecutive nights of care. For example, if the regular pattern is for a person to have care from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, then this entire period constitutes one care event. Other care events could be one night mid-week or 5 consecutive nights, depending on the expected pattern of care. Daytime care with no planned overnight stay is not generally a care event unless it is a significant amount of care and calculated as a percentage of care based on hours (4.1.1).


If a care event is missed but substitute care occurs at another time with the agreement of each party, it is not considered a missed event.


Example:Brian and Holly's parenting plan was made in March 2019 and states that Brian will have their child, Mia, for 9 weeks over the Christmas school holiday period. In March 2019, the Registrar determines the percentage of care for the child support assessment. The Registrar determines that Brian has 17% care and that Holly has 83%.


In November 2019, Brian tells Holly that he cannot care for Mia for the 2019–20 Christmas school holiday period due to his work commitments. As Brian will not provide this care, he will not meet the costs of Mia directly through care. Brian will miss 20% of his nights of care before he will have any nights of care, so Brian has never established a pattern of care in accordance with the expected pattern.


Until November 2019, Holly could not reasonably have known that Brian would not provide the care over the Christmas holiday period. If Holly advises the Registrar within a reasonable period of time of realising the pattern of care was never established (that is, November 2019), the Registrar would determine that Brian never established a pattern of regular care and that his care percentage is 0%.


The determination will have effect from the date the regular care percentage was first used in the assessment, March 2019. Child support arrears are likely to be created.


## Ceases a pattern of care


If a parent or non-parent carer notifies the Registrar within a reasonable period of time that another party ceased an established pattern of care of the child, the determination will have effect from the date the other party ceased the previously established pattern (section 54G(2)).


A parent or non-parent carer ceases a pattern of care when they stop having care of a child in accordance with the previously established pattern. The Registrar will generally consider that a previously established pattern of care has ceased if the parent or non-parent carer has:

• missed 3 care events in a row
• missed 5 care events out of 8, or
• missed 20% of the expected nights of care over 12 months (when calculating 20% the Registrar will not include an isolated event that is clearly not a change in the pattern).

The Registrar will consider the date care ceased to be the date of the first event that is used to demonstrate that at least regular care has ceased. For example, if a parent misses 5 care events out of 8, the date of the first missed event would be the date of effect of the new care percentages resulting from the below regular care determination.


Example:Kieran and Fiona had agreed that their son would stay with Kieran every Saturday night from March 2019. Kieran has the care as agreed until September 2019. In September 2019, Kieran misses the Saturday night care on the first and second weekend. Fiona contacts the Registrar when Kieran misses their Saturday night care on the third weekend.


When Fiona contacts Services Australia on 23 September 2019, she advises that Kieran missed care on 5 September 2019 and all subsequent weekends. As Fiona has advised the Registrar within a reasonable period of time that 3 care events in a row have been missed, the date of effect of the care change will be the date of the first event used to demonstrate that Kieran ceased their pattern of care: 5 September 2019.


## Notification not made within a reasonable period of time


If a parent or non-parent carer fails to notify the Registrar within a reasonable period of time that another party has less than regular care, the rules under4.1.5apply. The determination for the parent or non-parent carer with the increase in care will have effect from the date the Registrar was notified or otherwise becomes aware of the care change (section 54F(3)(b)). However, the determination for the parent or non-parent carer with the decrease in care will have effect from the day the change of care occurred (section 54F(3)(b)).


ForFTBpurposes, the actual date of the change in care will be used.

# 4.1.8 Agreements & orders relating to care


## Context


A written agreement is an agreement in writing and signed by both parents (1.1.P.10) or the parent/s and a non-parent carer regarding how a child will be cared for.


A parenting plan is a type of written agreement signed and dated by both parents. It is made under section 63C of the FL Act between separated (1.1.S.30) parents regarding how their child or children will be cared for and supported (which may include the parents agreeing to care (1.1.C.10) being provided by a non-parent carer). An agreement is not a parenting plan for the purposes of the FL Act unless it is made free from any threat, duress or coercion (FL Act section 63C(1A)). If a non-parent carer is a party to a written agreement, it is not a parenting plan for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes.


A court order is an order made by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, or a court of summary jurisdiction in each state or territory (for example, state magistrates courts and local courts exercising jurisdiction under the FL Act) which makes provision for the care of the children.


Where a non-parent carer has made an application against one parent only (because, for example, the other parent is deceased or is not resident in Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction) (1.1.R.10), any relevant orders or agreements will be between the assessed parent and the non-parent carer.


Note:Court orders include those made by the formerly separate Family Court of Australia and Federal Circuit Court of Australia, prior to 1 September 2021.

# 4.2 Disputed care & interim care rules


## Context


Where care (1.1.C.10) is disputed, an interim care period (1.1.I.50) may be available if a person with a reduced level of actual care in comparison to their level of care under a written care arrangement is taking reasonable action to have the arrangement complied with.


This chapter outlines the policy for decisions involving an interim care period.

# 4.2.1 When can an interim care determination be made?


## Context


If a person is prevented from having the child in their care (1.1.C.10) in accordance with the care arrangement (4.1.6) without their consent, and they take reasonable steps to have the care arrangement complied with, there may be an interim period where care is determined by the care arrangement rather than actual care.


There are a range of circumstances where a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) may be based on a care arrangement during an interim period, such as situations where contact has been prevented by one party, or where a child has not been returned after a contact visit, or where the child chooses to live with the other carer.


An interim period may apply where it is the first care percentage determination at the start of a child support assessment or in relation to a new relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) on an assessment. An interim period may also apply where there is a subsequent care percentage determination after a care change and the care change occurs on or after 29 March 2024.


If an interim care determination is made, the Registrar will determine 2 percentages of care (1.1.P.70) for each party under section 51 of the CSA Act.

• The first percentage is the amount of care the person should have of the child under the care arrangement. This percentage of care will apply during the interim period, which means child support (1.1.C.60) (andFTB, if relevant) will be assessed in accordance with the care arrangement for the interim period. The length of the interim period will depend on a number of factors.
• The second percentage is the amount of care the person actually has of the child. This percentage of care will apply after the interim period has ended.

Example:Jim and Keith have a court order made on 2 May 2021 providing them with 50% care each of their child, Fran, which they had been following since the start of the order. On 15 September 2023, when applying for a child support assessment for Fran, Jim advises Services Australia that Fran has been living with him full time from 1 August 2023. When Services Australia contacts Keith, he advises that he disputes the care change and is negotiating directly with Jim to resume the court-ordered care. Services Australia makes a decision to apply an interim period in the assessment from 15 September 2023 and the assessment recognises 50% care each for Jim and Keith for the interim period. The interim period may last up to 26 weeks from 1 August 2023, depending on whether Jim takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.


Example:Bill and Haley have a court order, made on 1 September 2018, providing them with 50% care each of their child, Lauren. Bill and Haley have had a child support case (1.1.C.80) for Lauren since 15 February 2019. Bill and Haley have been following the care percentages provided for in the court order. On 20 July 2024, Haley refuses to return Lauren to Bill's care and contacts Services Australia to advise that she will now have 100% care of Lauren. When Services Australia contacts Bill, he advises that he agrees care has changed as described by Haley, but disputes the change in care and is seeking legal advice about his options. Services Australia makes a decision to apply an interim period in the assessment from 20 July 2024 and the assessment recognises 50% care each for Bill and Haley for the interim period. The interim period may last up to 26 weeks from 20 July 2024, depending on whether Haley takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution.


Note:An interim period determination cannot be made if the application for a child support assessment is made after the end of the maximum interim period for the care percentage determination (see paragraph 53(1)(a) CSA Act).


Note:An interim period determination cannot be made in relation to a responsible person if a previous care determination made by the Registrar (or the Secretary for the purpose of FTB) in relation to the person has been revoked and the change in care occurred prior to 29 March 2024.


Note:If the Registrar has revoked a care percentage determination on the basis of a finding that a responsible person who was to have at least regular care (1.1.R.50) under a care arrangement did not take up that level of care despite the child being made available to that person by another responsible person (that is, a “below regular care determination” under CSA Act section 54G) then it is unlikely that an interim period will be able to apply in relation to the care determination that the Registrar is to make following that revocation (Child Support Registrar v CMU23(2024) FCA 109). This will typically be because the Registrar is not able to be satisfied that the parent with reduced care of the child is taking reasonable action to have a care arrangement complied with when they continue to not have care of the child, despite the child being made available to them. In some circumstances where a revocation has occurred under section 54G, the Registrar may not apply an interim period on the basis that they are satisfied that special circumstances apply in relation to the child. See4.1.7for further information about below regular care determinations under CSA Act section 54G.


Note:An interim period does not apply in cases where the child is taken by state or territory welfare authorities, as removal by the state under relevant child protection legislation has legal authority. For child support purposes, a care arrangement ceases to apply when the child has been removed by state or territory child welfare authorities.

# 4.2.1.10 Parent with reduced care - taking reasonable action to ensure compliance with care arrangement


## Context


The person with reduced care (1.1.C.10) must take reasonable action to ensure compliance with the care arrangement throughout the interim period in order to have the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) based on the care arrangement for the interim period.


If the person with reduced care ceases taking reasonable action, the interim period will end on the day the reasonable action ceased. Reasonable action could include:

• negotiating with the other party in a genuine attempt to ensure compliance with the care arrangement
• making themselves available in a genuine attempt to take up care of their child as provided for in the care arrangement
• making and/or attending an appointment at a Family Relationship Centre (FRC) or other dispute resolution service with the aim of ensuring the care arrangement is adhered to
• seeking or obtaining legal advice regarding the making of a court order
• filing an application to a court to have an order made or enforced
• attending a hearing at court to seek an order to be made or enforced, or
• notifying the police that the child has been taken without consent.

This list is not exhaustive and other forms of action may be considered reasonable, according to the circumstances of both parties and the child. The Registrar may seek evidence that reasonable action has been taken. Evidence may include:

• a written account of the steps the parent (1.1.P.10) has taken to negotiate with the other parent, verified by an independent third party such as a legal representative
• documentation from an FRC or dispute resolution service setting out the details of an upcoming appointment and the action sought, or
• documentation of police or court action.

Note:Where the parent with reduced care has not taken reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with, and their percentage of care (1.1.P.70) has been determined according to the actual care they have of the child (that is, an interim period determination was not made), and the parent subsequently takes reasonable action for the care arrangement to be complied with, an interim period will not apply.

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 4.2.1.20 Parent with increased care - taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution


## Context


The person with increased care must take continuous reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution in order for a shorter interim period to apply, and to avoid a later interim period applying.


## On this page

• Reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution
• Certificates issued by family dispute resolution practitioners under the FL Act

## Reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution


Reasonable action means participating in family dispute resolution, whether or not initiated by the person with increased care, with an accredited family dispute resolution practitioner within a reasonable period of the change of care day (CSA Act subsection 53A(3)). If the action did not occur within a reasonable period of the change of care day, the Registrar may determine that reasonable action started on a later date.


It is up to the Registrar to determine what is considered a 'reasonable period' in which the reasonable action started, and it will depend on the individual circumstances of each case. If the person with increased care does not take reasonable action within a reasonable period, the end of the interim period will be the end of 14 weeks starting on the day the person began taking reasonable action, rather than the change of care day.


Example:Joan and Kim have a court order made on 2 May 2015 providing them with 50% care each of their son, Fred. On 30 July 2024, Joan advises Services Australia that Fred has decided to live with her full time. When Services Australia contacts Kim, she advises that she disputes the care change and is negotiating directly with Joan to resume the court-ordered care. Kim also advises that Joan has been refusing her requests to attend family dispute resolution to resolve the issue, which Services Australia confirms with Joan. Services Australia makes a decision to apply an interim period from 30 July 2024. Because Joan is not taking reasonable action to attend family dispute resolution, the interim period will end on 27 January 2025 (26 weeks from the change of care day).


On 14 September 2024, Joan contacts Services Australia to advise that she decided to attend a family dispute resolution session arranged by Kim on the same day. Because Joan has started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution, the interim period will end earlier, on 20 December 2024 (14 weeks starting on the day Joan began to take reasonable action).


If the reasonable action ceases within the maximum interim period (for example, the person with increased care fails to attend a family dispute resolution session), then it is not considered continuous reasonable action. The effect of ceasing reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution will depend on when the reasonable action ceased. If the reasonable action ceased while a shorter interim period applied, the interim period will be extended to the maximum interim period. If the reasonable action ceased after a shorter interim period has ended but before the end of the maximum interim period, a later interim period will apply.


If the person with increased care starts to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution again (for example, they failed to attend an earlier session, but do attend a subsequent session), then the interim period may end earlier, subject to the rules outlined above.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 53A Meaning of interim period, section 53B When a person has increased care of a child


## Certificates issued by family dispute resolution practitioners under the FL Act


The Registrar may seek evidence that reasonable action has been taken, has ceased, or has re-started. This may include verification by the other party, documentation from a family dispute resolution practitioner, or a certificate issued under section 60I of the FL Act.


For a shorter interim period to apply, there is no requirement for the parent with increased care to take action other than taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. Section 60I certificates are part of the family dispute resolution framework and may be issued by a practitioner to a person for various reasons based on the conduct and outcome of the family dispute resolution process.


In certain circumstance a certificate may indicate that the person with increased care took reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution, and that it is no longer reasonable to continue to do so. On the other hand, a certificate could demonstrate that the person with increased care has not participated in family dispute resolution.


Where a certificate is presented as evidence, the Registrar will examine the details of the relevant certificate. A certificate will not always provide sufficient or conclusive evidence on its own to apply a shorter interim period. The Registrar will consider all the circumstances of the individual case to determine the duration of an interim period.

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 4.2.2 Length of interim period


## Context


The length of the interim period depends on a number of factors, including whether the care (1.1.C.10) arrangement is a court order, parenting plan or written agreement; when the care arrangement was made; when the disputed care (1.1.D.70) change occurred; whether the person with reduced care is taking reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with; and whether the person with increased care is taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (paragraph 53A(1)(b)). The maximum interim period will apply in situations where the person with increased care does not take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution at any time during that period.


## On this page

• When does an interim period start?
• Court orders
• Parenting plans & written agreements
• Later interim periods

## When does an interim period start?


The interim period begins on the first day that the actual care of the child ceased to correspond with the care provided for under the care arrangement (CSA Act paragraph 53A(1)(a)).


## Court orders


For court orders, the maximum interim period that can apply is the later of:

• 52 weeks from the day the care arrangement provided by the court order takes effect, or
• 26 weeks from the change of care day.

A shorter interim period may apply if the change of care occurs after the first 26 weeks from the day the court order takes effect, and the person with increased care takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. The shorter interim period will end at the earlier of:

• 14 weeks from the day the person with increased care started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (but no earlier than 52 weeks starting from the day the court order took effect), or
• 26 weeks from the change of care day.

Example:Zhiyan and Gavin have a court order, made on 1 June 2015, providing Zhiyan with 60% care and Gavin with 40% care of their 2 children. On 20 June 2024, Gavin refuses to return the children to Zhiyan's care and contacts Services Australia to advise that he will now have 100% care of both children. When Services Australia contacts Zhiyan, she advises that she disagrees with the change in care and has made an appointment with a Family Relationship Centre (FRC). Services Australia makes a decision that an interim period will apply from 20 June 2024.


Gavin subsequently attends the dispute resolution session at the FRC. Because he is taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution and the change of care occurred more than 38 weeks after the court order took effect, the interim period will end on 25 September 2024 (14 weeks starting from the change of care day, which is the day Services Australia is satisfied that Gavin began to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 5 Interpretation—definitions, section 51 Percentage of care if action taken …, section 53A Meaning of interim period, section 53B When a person has increased care of a child


## Parenting plans & written agreements


For parenting plans and written agreements, the maximum interim period that can apply is 14 weeks from the change of care day.


A shorter interim period may apply if the change of care occurs after the first 38 weeks from the day the parenting plan or written agreement takes effect, and the person with increased care takes reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution. The shorter interim period will end at the earlier of:

• 4 weeks from the day the person with increased care started taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (but no earlier than 52 weeks starting from the day the parenting plan or written agreement took effect), or
• 14 weeks from the change of care day.

At the end of the interim period, the care percentage will be determined according to actual care from the day after the end of the interim period.


Example:George and Mariam have a parenting plan, made on 13 December 2017, that provides George with 80% care and Mariam with 20% care of their teenage son, Aaron. On 30 November 2024, Mariam advises George that Aaron wants to start living with her, and contacts Services Australia to advise that she will be having at least 80% care of Aaron from now on. Mariam also advises Services Australia that she has made an appointment with a family dispute resolution practitioner to re-negotiate the parenting plan. When Services Australia contacts George, he advises that he disagrees with the care change and has spoken directly with Mariam about resuming the pattern of care provided for by the parenting plan.


Services Australia makes a decision that an interim period will apply from 30 November 2024. Because Mariam has taken reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution and the change of care occurred more than 48 weeks after the parenting plan takes effect, the interim period will end on 27 December 2024, 4 weeks from the change of care day.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 5 Interpretation—definitions, section 51 Percentage of care if action taken …, section 53A Meaning of interim period, section 53B When a person has increased care of a child


## Later interim periods


If a shorter interim period has ended, and the person with increased care ceases to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution before the maximum interim period has ended, a later interim period may apply (CSA Act subsection 53A(2)). The person with reduced care must still be taking reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with in order for the later interim period to apply. The later interim period will start on the day the person with increased care ceased to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution, and will end according to the same rules that apply for shorter interim periods.


Example:Alison and Will have a court order, made on 10 February 2016, that provides them with 50% care each of their twin daughters. On 30 August 2024, Will advises Services Australia that he will now have 100% care of his daughters. When Services Australia contacts Alison, she advises that she disagrees with the care change and is seeking legal advice about her options. Services Australia makes a decision to apply an interim period from 30 August 2024. Both parents attend a family dispute resolution session in September 2024, which means the interim period ends on 5 December 2024 (14 weeks from the change of care day, which is the day the Registrar is satisfied Will began taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution).


On 20 December 2024, Alison advises Services Australia that Will failed to attend a subsequent family dispute resolution session that day. Services Australia confirms this with Will and makes a decision that a later interim period will apply. The later interim period begins on 20 December 2024 (the date Will ceased taking reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution) and ends on 26 February 2025 (26 weeks from the change of care day).


If a later interim period applies, and the person with increased care begins to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution again, the later interim period may end earlier, according to the same rules that apply for shorter interim periods.


In some situations, an interim period may end early and no later interim period can apply in relation to the same care arrangement. For example, if the person with reduced care ceases to take reasonable action to ensure the care arrangement is complied with, or the care arrangement itself ceases to apply (for example, it has an 'end date'), the interim period will end on the day those events occur. Other examples include where:

• a new care arrangement begins to apply, or
• special circumstances exist in relation to the child (where those special circumstances were not present at the time the interim determination was made).

In these circumstances, the interim period will end the day before any of the above events occur.

# 4.2.3 Changes in care where an interim period applied


## Context


Where a shorter interim period has ended, the care percentages are determined according to the actual care that is occurring. If there is a subsequent change to the actual care of the child before the end of the maximum interim period, the new actual care percentages may be reflected in the child support assessment. The Registrar may suspend the earlier determination of actual care that was made under section 51 of the CSA Act, and the new actual care percentages will take effect from the day the Registrar is notified or otherwise becomes aware of the change in care (CSA Act section 54FA). If the change in actual care occurred before the end of a shorter or later interim period, the new actual care percentages will be reflected in the child support assessment from the day after the shorter or later interim period ends. If there are further changes to actual care before the end of the maximum interim period, the date of effect of those changes are subject to the rules outlined in section 54F.


If a later interim period applies, the Registrar must revoke the suspension of the earlier actual care determination and the subsequent actual care determination. The revocation takes effect from the day before the person with increased care ceased to take reasonable action to participate in family dispute resolution (subsection 54FA(3)).


After the maximum interim period has ended, the Registrar must revoke the actual care determination (that is, the second percentage of care that corresponded with the actual care of the child) and make a new care determination under section 49 or section 50 of the CSA Act (subsection 54FA(4)).


However, if the Registrar made a subsequent actual care determination that applied after the shorter interim period ended, the subsequent actual care determination will continue to apply after the maximum interim period has ended, until a change in care occurs. See4.1.5for information about care determinations and changes in care that apply outside of the interim period provisions.


Where the change in care affects the person's care percentage but not their cost percentage (1.1.C.200), the Registrar has discretion to revoke the previous care determination. These provisions are outlined in sections 54H and 54HA.

# 4.3 Alignment of care between child support & FTB


## Context


Care percentage (1.1.C.20) determinations can be made by either a delegate of the Child Support Registrar or of the Secretary (forFTBpurposes), where there is a child recognised in relation to a person in a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and the person receives FTB for the same child. Whether care (1.1.C.10) is determined by the Registrar or the Secretary, a single care determination applies for child support purposes and for FTB purposes. See topics4.1.1and4.2.2for information on determining care. For information on dates of effect for FTB purposes see FA Guide2.1.1.50and FTB in general is available in the FA Guide.

## Aligning care determinations between child support & FTB


Where there is a child recognised in a child support assessment, a person receives FTB for the same child, and a care determination needs to be made in respect of the child, the determination will be made by either the Registrar or the Secretary (CSA Act section 54K and FAAct section 35T). Once the determination is made, the single care determination applies for both child support (1.1.C.60) and FTB purposes.


However, there are some differences between child support and FTB legislation regarding when care determinations take effect.


Where care determinations for child support and FTB are aligned for a child, parents (1.1.P.10) and carers need to inform either the Registrar or the Secretary of any changes in care.


Example:Marlon and Hana share care of their child Robina. There is a child support assessment for Robina, and both Marlon and Hana receive FTB for Robina. A care change occurs for Robina, and Marlon informs the Registrar of the new care arrangements. The Registrar makes a new care determination, and the same care determination is used by the Secretary to calculate both parents' FTB entitlement.


If a person applies for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support and the care percentages for the relevant child have already been determined by the Secretary for FTB purposes, the Registrar must apply the care percentages determined by the Secretary if that determination has not been revoked and continues to apply. If the care arrangements have changed since the Secretary made the determination, the Registrar may revoke the existing percentages after applying them under CSA Act section 54K and make a new care determination.


## When a care determination will not be aligned


Where the child is not recognised in either a child support assessment (as a child support child or a relevant dependent child) or for FTB purposes, then the care determination will not be aligned. The parent or carer will need to contact the relevant agency to inform them of any changes to the child's care arrangements. For example, where there is a child support assessment but neither parent receives FTB for the child, then any changes to the care of the child must be notified to the Registrar.


## Objections & reviews of decisions


The same principles apply to objection (1.1.O.10) decisions, and reviews of decisions by theART(1.1.A.40) (CSA Act section 54L and FAAct section 35U). Where either the Registrar or the Secretary conducts an internal review of a care decision (see10.2for more information on objections), any new decision made on review will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary. Where the ART amends a decision or substitutes a new decision about a care percentage, that amended or substituted decision will be used by both the Registrar and the Secretary.


The date of effect of a care percentage decision may also vary between child support and FTB for review decisions, whether internal or external. Generally, if a person does not apply for a review within 28 days of receiving the decision that they wish to have reviewed, any amended or substituted decision will apply for child support purposes only from the date on which the application for review was made. However, if there are special circumstances that delayed the application, the new decision may completely replace the original decision (see10.2.8for more information).

The Guides to Social Policy Law is a collection of publications designed to assist decision makers administering social policy law. The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 4.2.4 Special circumstances where an interim period does not apply


## Context


In order to apply an interim period, the Registrar must be satisfied that there are no special circumstances that relate to the child. Where the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances that relate to the child, an interim period will not apply. The special circumstances could relate to the child directly or relate to another individual, such as the person with increased care (1.1.C.10), to the extent that those circumstances relate to the child.


The Registrar will consider the individual circumstances that led to the change in care to determine whether the circumstances are a significant cause of the change in care, and whether there was a substantial risk to the physical, emotional or psychological well-being of the child if the care arrangement had continued to be followed.


Special circumstances include, but are not limited to, situations where violence or other inappropriate behaviour by the person who has reduced care has contributed to the change in care. Examples of unreasonable or inappropriate behaviour of the parent (1.1.P.10) include:

• violence towards the child or the person with increased care
• exposing the child to family violence (within the meaning of section 4AB of the FL Act)
• directly involving the child in a criminal act
• exposing the child to alcohol, drugs or substance abuse
• substantially failing to comply with legal schooling requirements
• neglecting the child's basic needs, such as withholding essential medical care from the child or disregarding their daily needs for food, shelter, hygiene.

The decision should take into account any information provided by the parent with less care as well as information from the person who gained care. Decisions should be made on the basis of evidence that supports relevant findings of fact, particularly in situations where the facts are disputed. Acceptable evidence from an independent third party will vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Where a parent has been violent towards the child, the absence of a child welfare order would not prevent the discretion being exercised. However, allegations of abuse that are not supported by other evidence would not normally result in the discretion being exercised.


Suitable evidence may include (but is not limited to):

• a police report detailing violent behaviour towards a child or the person with increased care
• an intervention order preventing contact with the child or person with increased care, or
• statements from a medical or other relevant professional regarding assault or abuse of the child or person with increased care.

Example:Joanne and Adam have a court order which states that they will have equal shared care (1.1.S.40) of their son, Max. Joanne asks the Registrar to make a new care determination on the basis that Adam is no longer having any care of Max.


Joanne states she is denying care of Max to Adam after Max was returned from Adam's house with severe bruises and soreness. Max said that his father had been physically violent towards him and theGPwho treated him provided a statement that the injuries were consistent with the explanation provided by Max.


Adam has instituted proceedings in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia for a Recovery Order (1.1.R.30) for Max.


Given the special circumstances, the Registrar will amend the assessment using care percentages based on the care that is actually occurring despite Adam taking reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with.


Special circumstances are not limited to the inappropriate or unreasonable actions of a person. This means an interim period may not apply for reasons of special circumstances even where all parties have acted reasonably. The Registrar must be satisfied that the special circumstances relate in some way to the child. For example, a care arrangement may be unable to be complied with due to the illness, injury or actions of the child or another person to the extent that the circumstances relate to the child (such as where that person is unable to provide care for the child). If the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances that relate to the child in such a situation then an interim period will not apply because the reason the person is not able to have care of their child has not resulted from the child being withheld from them by the other parent or carer.


Example:Paul and Sheree have a court order which states that they will have equal shared care of their daughter, Stella, who is 17. Paul asks the Registrar to make a new care determination on the basis that Sheree is no longer having any care of Stella.


Paul states he is not denying care of Stella to Sheree, as Stella is adamant she does not want to return to Sheree’s house. Paul has been trying to facilitate care of Stella for Sheree in accordance with the court order, and has packed her bag every week, and is ready and waiting to drive Stella to Sheree’s house at the normal drop off time each week. Paul does not drop Stella at Sheree’s house, as Stella will not get in the car. No conflicting activities are arranged by Paul for Stella.


Sheree regularly reminds Paul that she expects him to comply with the orders, and is ready and waiting at home to receive Stella at the usual drop off time.


Sheree books a family counselling session at Relationships Australia with the objective that a discussion with a mediator may help Stella agree to go back to 50/50 care. The earliest available session is in 2 months. Paul agrees to attend, however Stella refuses to attend.


Given the circumstances the Registrar decides to revoke Paul and Sheree’s 50% care percentage determinations under section 54G of the CSA Act on the basis that Paul has been required to take on increased care of Stella and this should be recognised in the assessment.


Given the special circumstances, the Registrar will amend the assessment using care percentages based on the care that is actually occurring, despite Sheree taking reasonable action to have the care arrangement complied with.


## Validation of past interim period determinations


TheSocial Services Legislation Amendment (Child Support and Family Assistance Technical Amendments) Act 2024provides that the legal validity of an interim care decision made between 23 May 2018 and 28 March 2024 inclusive is unimpacted by an earlier determination being revoked under section 54F or section 54H of the CSA Act (notwithstanding repealed paragraph 53(1)(c) of the CSA Act, which was in force during that period).

# 5.2.11 Reason 10 - responsibility of the parent to maintain a resident child


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if a parent's capacity to provide financial support for the child of the assessment is significantly reduced because of the responsibility of the parent to maintain a 'resident child'.


## Act references

## Terminology


Child support parent - refers to the person who is a party to the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), and who is not a legal parent of the resident child.


Legal parent - refers to the parents of the resident child at law. They may be the child's biological or adoptive parents, or the people who are the parents of a child born as a result of an artificial conception procedure pursuant to FL Act section 60H, or the parents of a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement pursuant to FL Act section 60HB.


## Grounds for departure


There can be a reason for changing an assessment if the capacity of either child support (1.1.C.60) parent to provide financial support for the child/ren is significantly reduced because they have a responsibility to maintain a 'resident child'.


The 3 threshold requirements are:

• there are 'special circumstances'
• the child support parent has the responsibility to maintain a 'resident child', and
• the responsibility significantly affects the child support parent's ability to provide financial support for the child of the child support assessment.

The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


## Resident child


A 'resident child' of a child support parent is a child who (CSA Act section 117(10)):

• normally lives with the child support parent, but is not a child of the child support parent
• the child support parent is, or was, for 2 continuous years, amember of a couple(1.1.M.10)
• the other member of the couple is, or was, a legal parent of the child
• the child is aged under 18
• the child is not amember of a couple, and
• one or more of the following applies in respect of each legal parent of the childthe legal parent has diedthe legal parent isunable to support the childdue to theill health of the legal parentthe legal parent isunable to support the childdue to thecaring responsibilities of the legal parent, and
• the legal parent has died
• the legal parent isunable to support the childdue to theill health of the legal parent
• the legal parent isunable to support the childdue to thecaring responsibilities of the legal parent, and
• the resident child requires financial assistance.

In circumstances where a parent has a 'legal duty' to support a child, an application should be made under Reason 9 (5.2.10).


The term 'normally lives with' is not defined in the CSA Act. Generally a child will be considered to 'normally live with' a child support parent if that parent has at least shared care (1.1.S.40) of the child. This does not exclude an extraordinary circumstance where the child support parent has regular care (1.1.R.50) or below regular care (1.1.B.20) but the child support parent still provides and cares (1.1.C.10) for the child, for example, where a child is at boarding school.


## Member of a couple genuinely living together


The factors to be considered in establishing whether members of a couple are living together as partners on a genuine domestic basis are explained in SS Guide2.2.5.30.


A person cannot live with another person as their partner on a genuine domestic basis if they are aged under 16 years. This is because a person is living with another person as their partner on a genuine domestic basis if the relationship has the characteristics of marriage (FO v HAF[2006] QCA 555;Re Kennison and Secretary, Department of Social Security(1985) 8 ALD 560). To have the characteristics of marriage, the persons must be at least 16 years old, which refers to a person's capacity to marry pursuant to theMarriage Act 1961(Cth).


The child support parent may need to provide evidence to the Registrar that they are or were a member of a couple.


A child support parent does not have to have a current partner to apply under this reason. The resident child can be a child of the child support parent's former partner, if:

• the child remained with the child support parent after they separated (1.1.S.30), or
• the partner is deceased and the child remained with the child support parent

so long as the relationship with the legal parent continued for at least 2 years (CSA Act section 117(10)).


## Legal parent is unable to support the child


When the Registrar is considering whether a legal parent is 'unable to support the child' because of 'ill health' or 'caring responsibilities', an ongoing income stream, although the most obvious way a parent has of supporting the child, is not the only avenue of support available. The Registrar must also consider whether a legal parent has any other way of supporting the child, that is, savings, social security benefits, compensation, assets etc.


Note:If a legal parent is receiving a social security pension or benefit they would be considered able to support the child, even if this is only at theMAR(1.1.M.20). The only exception to this would be if the legal parent's circumstances would otherwise qualify them for a reduction under CSA Act section 66A.


FTBis not a social security pension or benefit. However, it is paid to the legal parent for the children in their care, and is considered to be income from which the legal parent could support the child.


## Legal parent's ill health


If a legal parent has health problems, this may mean that they are unable to earn income to support the child/ren.


The Registrar will take into account any evidence that the legal parent presents about their state of physical and mental health. It would usually be expected that a legal parent's state of health will have been diagnosed by a qualified medical practitioner and they are being treated for the condition. Therefore, the legal parent would usually be able to provide medical certificates or reports from their treating doctor, and/or reports from any specialist to whom the legal parent was referred.


The following factors are relevant in considering whether a legal parent's state of health affects their ability to support their child/ren:

• the fact that the legal parent suffers from a medical condition
• the impact of the medical condition on the legal parent's ability to work
• the expected duration of the condition
• any recommended treatment, and the impact that this has on the legal parent's ability to support the child/ren
• the availability of light duties, if the legal parent could work in a restricted capacity.

The Registrar will weigh up the evidence about these and any other relevant matters in order to decide whether the legal parent's ill health is such that they are unable to support their child/ren.


## Legal parent's caring responsibilities


The type of caring responsibilities that might justify a legal parent's inability to earn income to support their child/ren will only be a personal responsibility to care for another person. Caring responsibilities could include caring for their child, parent, elderly relatives or friends.


The following factors are relevant in considering whether a legal parent's caring responsibilities affects their ability to support their child/ren:

• the relationship between the legal parent and the person being cared for
• whether the legal parent has a legal duty to maintain the person for whom they are providing care
• if the legal parent does not have a legal duty, whether they have a moral duty and the extent of that moral duty
• the degree and type of care provided
• whether the legal parent has some capacity for part time or casual work in conjunction with their caring responsibilities
• the availability of alternative care (personal and institutional)
• whether that alternative care is suitable and/or affordable, and
• the previous and proposed duration of the period of care.

The Registrar will weigh up the evidence about these and any other relevant matters in order to decide whether the legal parent's caring responsibilities are such that they are unable to support the child/ren.


A legal parent who has been in the workforce may cease work, or reduce their work commitments to accommodate their caring responsibilities. Where this is a longstanding arrangement (for example, one that existed prior to becoming a member of a couple for 2 continuous years with the child support parent), the legal parent's ability and opportunity to undertake paid employment is diminished by their caring responsibilities and their absence from the workforce.


If the legal parent's caring responsibilities would not prevent work, or additional work, the Registrar may consider that their caring responsibilities do not affect their ability to support the child/ren.


## Just and equitable


Once a child support parent has established a reason to change their assessment the Registrar must consider whether it would be fair or just and equitable in relation to the children of the child support assessment, both child support parents, the community and the resident child to make a particular decision (CSA Act section 98C(1)(b)(ii), section 98C(3) and section 117(4) to (9)).


As the legislation requires that the resident child must require financial assistance (CSA Act section 117(10)(g)), an application under this reason will require the Registrar to consider the circumstances of both the legal parents of the resident child, as well as the income and financial circumstances of the applicant and the other child support parent.


If there are other sources of income that already adequately provide for a resident child, or could do so, it would not normally be just and equitable to assess the child support parent's resources as affected by the resident child's needs. A child support parent will not be considered as being required to meet the resident child's costs unless both legal parents are unable to do so due to death, or unable to earn income due to ill health or caring responsibilities.


The Registrar can consider the following in deciding if a change is fair:

• the source and amount of any benefit paid to or in respect of the resident child (for example, social security pensions or benefits)
• whether child support is being paid for the resident child
• the cost of caring for the resident child
• the income and resources of the resident child's legal parents
• whether the assessment has already been adjusted to take the resident child into account
• whether any other adult who has a legal duty to maintain the resident child has a capacity to do so
• the total expenditure outlaid to maintain the applicant's household, and
• any assets and other resources held by, or available to, all the members of the child support parent's household and both legal parents of the resident child.

## Privacy considerations


To establish a case under this reason, a child support parent may be asked to provide financial information to the Registrar about a third party. For example, the child support parent may be asked to provide evidence to support their claim that their partner (the resident child's legal parent) is unable to earn income as well as information about that person's financial circumstances.


Before providing this information to the Registrar, the child support parent must discuss disclosure of information with the third party about whom the information relates.


See11.4for further information on privacy and secrecy.


## The kinds of decisions the Registrar can make


If this reason is established, the types of decisions that the Registrar can make are set out in5.5.2(CSA Act section 98S).


When making a decision under this reason, the Registrar will usually adjust the parent's self-support amount (1.1.S.20) to reflect their responsibility to maintain the resident child. The Registrar will set out the basis for determining this in the decision.

# 5.2 Reasons for a change of assessment


## Context


The 10 reasons for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) application are listed in the CSA Act.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 98C, section 117


## Description


The Registrar can only change an assessment if one or more of 10 listed reasons is established 'because of the special circumstances that exist' (98C and 117(2)).


There are 10 reasons for a change of assessment (section 117(2)).

• Reason 1 (5.2.1) - The costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by high costs of enabling a parent (1.1.P.10) to spend time with, or communicate with, the child.
• Reason 2 (5.2.2) - The costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by high costs associated with the child's special needs.
• Reason 3 (5.2.3) - The costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by high costs of caring for, educating or training the child in the way both parents expected.
• Reason 4 (5.2.4) - The child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is unfair because of the child's income, earning capacity, property or financial resources.
• Reason 5 (5.2.5) - The child support assessment is unfair because the payer (1.1.P.40) has paid or transferred money, goods or property to the child, the payee (1.1.P.30), or a third party for the benefit of the child.
• Reason 6 (5.2.6) - The costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by the high child care costs for the child (and the child is under 12 years of age).
• Reason 7 (5.2.7) - The parent's capacity to support the child is significantly reduced because of their necessary commitments to support themselves.

• Reason 8B (5.2.9) – The child support assessment is unfair because of the earning capacity of one or both parents.

# 5 Change of assessment


## Introduction


While a formula assessment (Part 2) (1.1.F.20) reflects the needs of most separated families, the change of assessment (1.1.C.50) process allows Services Australia to determine if there are special circumstances which mean the amount of child support (1.1.C.60) payable should be adjusted to reflect the broader financial circumstances of both parents (1.1.P.10).


The chapters of this part describe the change of assessment process, the reasons under which a change of assessment application can be made, and the issues that the Registrar must consider when making a decision to change an assessment under CSA Act Part 6A.


## In this part


This part contains the following chapters:

• 5.2 Reasons for a change of assessment
• 5.3 Would a change be just and equitable?

# 5.1 What is a change of assessment?


## Context


The Registrar uses an administrative formula to make a child support assessment (1.1.C.70). The administrative formula is explained in2.2. However, if parents (1.1.P.10) or children have special circumstances, the administrative formula may not provide a fair level of child support (1.1.C.60).


Either party to an assessment can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50). The Registrar can also initiate a change to a child support assessment where the Registrar believes that the income, property and financial resources or earning capacity of either parent is not accurately reflected in the assessment (Reason 8A (5.2.8) and Reason 8B (5.2.9)). This is called a 'Registrar-initiated change of assessment' (5.6.2).


CSA Act Part 6A provides a means for the Registrar to administratively change a child support assessment to reflect the special circumstances of a case. CSA Act Part 7 Division 4 provides a means for certain courts to change a child support assessment to reflect the special circumstances of a case.


This topic explains when the Registrar or a court can consider changing an assessment.

• Parties to an assessment
• Period for which the assessment can be changed

• Death of party during change of assessment proceedings

## Special circumstances


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


The Registrar or a court can only change an assessment if one or more of 10 listed reasons (5.2) is established in the special circumstances of the case (sections 98C, 117(1)(b)(i) and 117(2)). If one of the reasons for a change of assessment is established, the Registrar or a court must also consider whether changing the assessment would be 'just and equitable' (5.3) and 'otherwise proper' (5.4) (sections 98C(1) and 117(1)(b)(ii)).


## Parties to a change of assessment


The parties to a change of assessment application are the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support (CSA Act section 98B(2)). All the parties to the assessment (including non-parent carers) are parties to the change of assessment.


The parties to a Registrar-initiated change of assessment are the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support (section 98K(2)). If there is more than one payee (1.1.P.30) or payer (1.1.P.40) in the case, because of a non-parent carer, then all the parties involved in the case are parties to the Registrar-initiated change of assessment.


## Period for which the assessment can be changed


The Registrar can prospectively change the child support assessment and may also make a determination changing the assessment for up to 18 months prior to the date upon which the person lodges their change of assessment application with Services Australia (section 98S(3B)(a)).


The earliest date from which the Registrar can change the assessment is the first day of the 18 month period which ends prior to the day the change of assessment application was made. This is calculated by determining the corresponding day in the calendar month that was 18 months before the day the application was made.


Example:A change of assessment application was lodged on 15 June 2025. The first day of the 18 month period ending before the application was made (that is, the period ending 14 June 2025) is 15 December 2023. Therefore, the earliest day from which the Registrar can change the assessment is 15 December 2023.


Sometimes an application will be made on a day in which there is no corresponding day in the calendar month that is 18 months earlier. In these cases, the earliest day from which the Registrar can change the assessment is the last day in the calendar month that is 18 months before the day the application was made.


Example:A change of assessment application was lodged on 31 August 2024. The earliest day from which the Registrar can change the assessment is 28 February 2023.


If the person applying for a change of assessment wants the Registrar to consider changing the assessment for a period 18 months or more prior to their application, they can apply to a court for leave under section 111. A court may grant leave for the Registrar to make a change to the assessment for a specified period up to 7 years prior to the day on which the person applied to the court for leave (section 112(7)). A court may alternatively grant leave and make an order itself to change the assessment for up to 7 years prior to the day on which the application to the court was made. It is not necessary for the applicant to have applied for the court to make the order itself, only that the court is satisfied that to do so would be in the interest of the parties (section 112(3A), see10.4.2for an application for amendment of administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) that is more than 18 months old).


The Registrar can make a prospective change to the assessment of child support and may also make a retrospective determination to change the assessment for up to 18 months before the date upon which the parties were notified that the Registrar was considering making a change to the assessment (section 98S(3B)(b)). The Registrar can apply to court for leave to be granted under section 112 to make a retrospective determination that changes the assessment for up to 7 years before the day upon which the application was made to the court for leave (section 111(3)).


## Can the Registrar or a court change a child support assessment if it has ended?


The Registrar can make a change of assessment decision for aCSP(1.1.C.150) that has ended, however the applicant's child support assessment for that child must still be in force on the day the application for a change of assessment is made (section 98B(1)).


Where the child support assessment has ended (for example, due to a terminating event), an application cannot be made for the Registrar to make a change of assessment for a past period, even if a court were to grant leave (under section 112) for the Registrar to make a change of assessment decision.


An application can be made to a court to make a change of assessment decision under section 118 in relation to a case that has ended:

• an application can be made under section 116 to a court for an order under section 118 to vary the child support assessment for a period that is less than 18 months earlier than when the application is made, by an applicant who isa parent or carer who is a party to a pending application in a court having jurisdiction under the CSA Act, ora paying parent who is assessed on theMAR(2.3.4) (1.1.M.20).
• a parent or carer who is a party to a pending application in a court having jurisdiction under the CSA Act, or
• a paying parent who is assessed on theMAR(2.3.4) (1.1.M.20).
• if a parent or carer wishes to amend an assessment for a day in a CSP that is more than 18 months but less than 7 years earlier than when the application is made, they must apply (under section 111) to a court for leave (under section 112). If leave is granted under section 112, they are taken to have applied under section 116 and the court may make an order under section 118 to vary the child support assessment for that period.
• the court can make an order under section 118 where a parent or carer's child support agreement has been set aside by the court under section 136, and there was an administrative assessment already in place at the date from which the agreement was set aside.

## Death of party during change of assessment proceedings


If one party dies while the change of assessment proceedings are underway, the application may continue if the Registrar is satisfied that the deceased party had a reasonable opportunity to provide relevant information, or their representative can provide it on their behalf.

# 5.2.10 Reason 9 - the duty to maintain any other child or another person


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the capacity of either parent to support the child is significantly reduced by their duty to maintain another child (including a relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60)) or person.


Reason 9 does not apply in relation to the children for whom child support (1.1.C.60) is transferable between the payer (1.1.P.40) and payee (1.1.P.30) (that is, the children for whom the payer must pay child support to the payee). For more information on when a parent or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment if the costs of a child are significantly affected by the child’s special needs under Reason 2 (5.2.2).

• Adult children

## Grounds for departure


There can be a reason for changing an assessment if, in the special circumstances of the case, the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for the child is significantly reduced because of (CSA Act section 117(2)(a)):

• the duty of the parent to maintain any other child or another person (CSA Act section 117(2)(a)(i))
• the special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain (CSA Act section 117(2)(a)(ii))
• the commitments of the parent necessary to enable the parent to support any other child or another person that the parent has aduty to maintain(CSA Act section 117(2)(a)(iii)(B)), or
• thehigh costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain(CSA Act section 117(2)(a)(iv)).

The 3 threshold requirements are:

• there are 'special circumstances'
• the applicant has a duty to maintain another person, and
• that duty significantly reduces the applicant's ability to provide financial support for the child.

The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


## Duty to maintain


The words 'duty to maintain' are generally limited to a legal duty. Early case law established that the duty had to be a legal duty and not just a moral obligation to maintain another person (Vick and Hartcher(1991) FLC 92-262).


The principles established inVick and Hartcherwere later adopted inDwyer v McGuire(1993) FLC 92-420where it was found that a husband had no legal duty to support his elderly parents and sister. The case law preceded recent legislative developments in the FL Act reflecting current community expectations regarding separated de facto spouses. For the purposes of Reason 9, those community expectations also include the recognition of the duty of de facto spouses to maintain each other during an intact relationship.


Example:A person may have a duty to maintain another person if:

• they are supporting their husband or wifein accordance with section 72 of the FL Act
• they are supporting their de facto spouse with whom they are living on a genuine domestic basis
• they are supporting their partner (1.1.P.20) in accordance with the relevant state or territory law
• they are paying spousal maintenance to a former husband or wife in accordance with an order made under the FL Act, or by a foreign court
• they are paying maintenance to a former de facto partner in accordance with an order made under the FL Act or theFamily Court Act 1997(WA), or by a foreign court
• the person is male and is supporting the mother of his child (to whom he is not married, nor in a de facto relationship) for thechildbirth maintenance period
• they are supporting a child (including a step-child) who is arelevant dependent child
• they are supporting anadult childin accordance with section 66L of the FL Act
• they are paying child maintenance for a child (including a step-child) in accordance with a court order made under the Family Law Act, or by a foreign court (that is, not an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support)
• they have an obligation to support a child under State legislation (for example, an order for child maintenance made under the Family Court Act 1997 (WA)), or
• the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia has made consent orders recognisingKupai Omasker(the Torres Strait Islander traditional practice of adoption).

A person does not have a duty to support a person for whom they have provided an assurance of support as a condition of that other person's migration to Australia. An assurance of support is the assuror's undertaking to repay the Commonwealth for certain entitlements that the assuree may claim while in Australia. It does not create a legally enforceable duty for the assuror to support the assuree.


## Step-children


Generally, parents do not have a duty to support a step-child without a court order imposing such a duty. Reason 10 (5.2.11) enables either parent to seek a change to the assessment because their capacity to provide support for the child is significantly reduced because of the responsibility of the parent to maintain a resident child (CSA Act section 117(2)(aa)).


## Relevant dependent children


The administrative child support formula (1.1.C.110) already takes into account a parent's responsibility to support their relevant dependent children (that is, the parent's children by birth or adoption) by deducting a relevant dependent child amount from the parent's income before calculating child support. A duty to maintain a relevant dependent child will not be a special circumstance that would warrant a change to the assessment, unless the child also has aspecial need.


## Current spouse or partner


A person may have a legal duty, under section 72 of the FL Act, to support their spouse or de facto partner where their partner is unable to adequately support themselves by reason of:

• having the care (1.1.C.10) and control of a child of the relationship who is under 18
• their age, physical or mental incapacity to obtain employment, or
• any other adequate reason.

This duty relates to a person's spouse or partner where they are in an intact relationship. Whether a person is in an intact relationship with another person can be determined, for example, by reference to the definition of a 'member of a couple' (1.1.M.10).


The factors to be considered in establishing whether people are living together as partners on a genuine domestic basis are explained in SS Guide2.2.5.30.


A person is liable to support their partner only to the extent that they are reasonably able to do so, taking into account the matters listed in section 75(2) of the FL Act.


Example:Abigail is liable to pay child support to Ruth for their child Emily. Abigail has re-married. Her partner Theo is unable to work. There are no children of Abigail and Theo's marriage. Abigail may have a duty to maintain Theo, depending upon the reasons for Theo's inability to work.


The formula does not take into account a parent's responsibility to support a dependent spouse. However, the fact that a parent's spouse is staying home to care for the children of the marriage does not, of itself, meet the Reason 9 test. Nor is it sufficient that the parent's income does not meet the needs of the household, as a result of the spouse's unemployment (or under-employment). The applicant must also be able to show that there are special circumstances in their case.


Example:Bobbie and Erna have a child support case (1.1.C.80) for their child Tom. Bobbie has re-partnered and lives with his new partner on a genuine domestic basis. Bobbie and his new partner Berna have a disabled child, Rachelle. Berna is unable to return to the workforce because Rachelle's disability prevents Rachelle attending school or using childcare. Rachelle's disability is a special circumstance and Bobbie has a duty to maintain Berna, as well as a duty to maintain Rachelle. Bobbie's duty to maintain Berna and Rachelle significantly affects his capacity to provide financial support for Tom.


Example:Cassie and Byrne have a child support case for their child Pearl. Cassie is married to Bart who has a child Jerry. Jerry's other parent is deceased. Bart is not employed and has no personal income. Bart provides full-time care at home for Jerry, who has special needs. Cassie has no duty to maintain Jerry, as Jerry is not Cassie's child. However, Cassie does have a duty to maintain Bart because Cassie is married to Bart.


Where a person applies under this reason because their partner or child has a medical condition, or requires medical treatment, the Registrar will require them to provide appropriate medical evidence of that condition.


## Former spouse or partner


A person may have a legal duty to support a former spouse or partner where:

• they are paying spousal maintenance to a former husband or wife in accordance with an order made under the FL Act, or by a foreign court
• they are paying maintenance to a former de facto partner in accordance with an order made under the FL Act or the Family Court Act 1997 (WA), or by a foreign court
• the person is male and is supporting the mother of his child (to whom he is not married, nor in a de facto relationship) for thechildbirth maintenance period.

## Child birth maintenance period (where the parents are not married nor in a de facto relationship)


The father of an unborn child may be liable to pay maintenance to the mother, and reasonable medical expenses in relation to the birth, in most cases for a period of 2 months prior to the birth and 3 months after the birth (FL Act section 4 and section 67B, or Family Court Act 1997 (WA) section 5 and section 135). Section 67C of the FL Act sets out the matters that are to be considered in determining the contributions the father is liable to make (or section 136 of the Family Court Act 1997 (WA)).


Where a person applies under this reason because they have a duty to support the mother of their unborn child, the Registrar will require them to provide appropriate medical evidence of the pregnancy and the expected date of confinement. The Registrar will also require information about the mother's financial circumstances (see section 67C of the FL Act and section 136 of the Family Court Act 1997 (WA)).


## Adult children


A parent does not automatically have a duty to maintain an adult child, who is a child of the parent who is aged 18 years and over.


A court can make an order for the maintenance of an adult child if it can be established that maintenance is necessary to enable the child to complete their education or because of a mental or physical incapacity (FL Act section 66L). A parent (either the payer or the payee) must be able to show that they have a duty to maintain an adult child before an assessment can be changed. If the Registrar is satisfied that the child meets the criteria set out in section 66L a reason can be established even if an order has not been made (Bienke v Bienke-Robson(1997) FLC 92-786).


The Registrar may recommend that an application be made to a court having jurisdiction under the CSA Act (section 98E) in cases where it is too complicated to determine whether the 'adult' child is continuing education or whether they have a mental or physical incapacity. However, in most cases, the Registrar will be able to make a finding on the basis of evidence supplied by the applicant and respondent.


When deciding if a parent has a duty to maintain an adult child who is proposing to undertake tertiary education, the Registrar may consider the following factors set out inCosgrove v Cosgrove(1996) FLC 92-700:

• whether the child's dependence upon its parents had ceased and the application amounts to a reinstatement of that dependence
• the period between the initial cessation of dependence (if any) and the application
• whether the child had completed the course of education intended by the parents to outfit them for employment sufficient to support the child
• other assistance, benefits or education which the child has received
• the ability of the child to complete the course in question
• the likelihood of the child completing the course in question
• the financial capacity of the child to maintain himself or herself to the completion of the education
• the financial circumstances of those responsible for the support of the child (generally the parents), and
• the filial relationship between the child and the person from whom maintenance is sought.

A carer (parent or non-parent carer) entitled to child support for a child who is turning 18 can apply to extend a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) (including one based on an agreement) provided the child will be in full-time secondary education (1.1.F.30) on their 18th birthday. More information is provided in2.5.3.


## Kupai Omasker


A duty to maintain a child will be established where the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia has issued consent orders that recognise Kupai Omasker, the Torres Strait Islander traditional practice of adoption.


## Special needs


The term 'special needs' is not defined in the legislation and is explained in Reason 2 (5.2.2). The person who seeks to rely on this reason will need to provide documentation, such as medical evidence, to substantiate their claim. Similarly, the Registrar will require the parent making the application to provide evidence of the net expenditure associated with the special need.


## Costs of enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, a child or person


If a parent has high costs in enabling them to spend time with, or communicate with, a child or person they have a duty to maintain (other than the child support child), this may also be a reason for a change of assessment. The principles that apply to calculating costs to spend time with, or communicate with, a child or person under Reason 9 are the same as those applying to Reason 1 (5.2.1).

# 5.2.1 Reason 1 - high costs in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, a child


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by the high costs of enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child.


If the parent's capacity to support the child is affected by their high costs in spending time with another child or person whom they have a legal duty to maintain, this can be addressed under change of assessment Reason 9 (5.2.10).

## Grounds for departure under Reason 1


There may be a reason for changing an assessment if, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because of high costs involved in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child (section 117 (2)(b)(i)).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


The Registrar can decide to change the assessment if the reason is established and it would be just and equitable (5.3) and otherwise proper (5.4) to do so.


## Who can apply under this reason?


The payer (1.1.P.40) and the payee (1.1.P.30) are both entitled to apply under this reason in relation to the costs incurred in enabling a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child.


## Are the costs high?


A parent's costs are high if during aCSP(1.1.C.150) they total more than 5% of the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) for the period (section 117(2B)). The parent's ATI for the period is calculated by:

• dividing the parent's ATI (3.1.1) for the period (which is expressed as an annual figure) by 365, and
• multiplying by the number of days in the period.

The Registrar will use the parent's ATI for the CSP in which the costs are, or will be, incurred. This will be the income for the last financial year that ended before the start of the CSP, unless the Registrar:

• calculates the threshold using the parent's estimated income (3.4)
• calculates the threshold using the parent's post-separation income (1.1.P.90), or
• uses the parent's ATI amount that has been varied bya child support (1.1.C.60) agreement (Part 6)a court order (2.5.5), ora previous change of assessment decision (5.5).
• a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement (Part 6)
• a court order (2.5.5), or
• a previous change of assessment decision (5.5).

The Registrar will use the following method to calculate whether the parent's costs are high in a case where their ATI changes within the CSP (for example, because the parent lodged an estimate of their income within the CSP):

• Work out the parent's costs for the whole CSP.
• Divide the CSP up into separate sub-periods according to the dates to which the different ATI apply.
• Calculate the number of days in each sub-period.
• For each 'sub-period', divide the ATI by 365 then multiply the result by the number of days in the 'sub-period' to calculate the sub-period ATI figure.
• Work out the sum of all the sub-period ATI figures.
• Are the costs at step 1 more than 5% of the total amount at step 5?
• If yes, the parent's costs are high.

### Other relevant matters


The following factors can also be relevant:

• Whether the arrangements for spending time with, or communicating with, the child are as ordered by a court or agreed between the parents, for example in a parenting plan.
• Whether the application is made prior to the costs being incurred. A prior pattern for spending time with, or communicating with, the child can be considered. Anticipated costs can be taken into account but there must be a reasonable expectation that the costs will be incurred.
• Whether the parent can substantiate the costs.

## High costs that significantly affect the costs of maintaining the child


If satisfied that the costs are high, the Registrar must decide whether the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected by those high costs. The extent to which the costs exceed the 5% threshold is relevant. If the costs are only slightly higher than the threshold, they might not significantly affect the costs of maintaining the child.


## What costs can be included?


The costs included in the change of assessment application must relate to enabling the parent to spend time or communicate with the child, rather than to enjoy that time or communication (Hall and Rushton(1991) FLC 92-249). The cost of entertainment cannot be included, as this is a cost of enjoying, rather than enabling, time with the child, or communication with the child.


The costs should be verified by appropriate documentary evidence such as hotel/motel receipts, credit card statements, petrol receipts and itemised telephone bills. Costs must be reasonable and in proportion to the income of the parent.


### Telephone & internet costs


Telephone and internet costs can be considered (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


### Costs of transport & travel


Accommodation, transport and travel costs can be considered (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


Transport costs include parking costs, road tolls, train, ferry, taxi or bus fares, airfares, the cost of car hire, and motor vehicle expenses.


Where a parent has at least regular care (4.1.1) (1.1.R.50) of a child, the only costs that can be taken into account under this reason for that parent are costs related to travel to enable the parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child (section 117(2C)).


The costs of travel can include actual transport costs (airfares, petrol, etc.) as well as the cost of any accommodation that is incidental to the travel, but not the costs of accommodation that is for the purpose of having contact with the children.


Example:The paying parent lives in Sydney and the child lives in Brisbane. The parent drives to see the child and spends the night in Port Macquarie on the way. After they collect the child, they pay for accommodation at a caravan park in Brisbane. If the paying parent has at least regular care of the child they can claim the cost of staying at Port Macquarie and the cost of fuel in driving to Brisbane, but NOT the cost of staying with the child in the caravan park.


### Legal costs


Legal costs incurred by either parent to establish, modify, or enforce arrangements can be significant. However, the courts have held that these expenses cannot appropriately be included as a cost of enabling them to spend time with, or communicate with, the child for the purposes of departing from a child support assessment (MAV & NTV(2005) FMCAfam 261 (31 May 2005)). The Registrar must consider each case on its merits, but will take into account relevant decisions of courts and tribunals. Consequently, a change of assessment application based on legal costs incurred by a parent in establishing contact with a child is unlikely to succeed.


## How are the costs measured?


Some factors that affect the way costs are identified and measured are:

• Motor vehicle costs - when calculating motor vehicle expenses the Registrar will generally accept that the actual cost (rather than the tax rate, AAA, NRMA, RACQ or other motor association rate) is allowable (Houlihan and Houlihan(1991) FLC 92-248). The tax rate is designed for car travel up to 5000 km to take account of the additional costs of acquiring and maintaining a commercial vehicle and is not an appropriate measure for the costs. In considering a parent's actual costs, the proportion of use of the vehicle for the purposes of spending time or communicating with the child should be considered.
• Discounted fares and frequent flyer points - a parent is expected to arrange cost effective travel for themselves or the children wherever possible, and this will be taken into account when calculating the costs.
• A parent or child's travel costs that are met via an allowance from an employer or salary sacrifice arrangement (rather than the parent paying for those costs directly) are considered to be the parent's costs if the allowance/fringe benefit is included in the parent's ATI.
• Dual purpose costs - if the costs are incurred for dual purposes or mixed-occasion visits, such as a wedding, funeral or business trip, only a portion of the costs can be considered.
• Costs of food - the cost of food for children is not included (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279) although the cost of food for the parent on a trip to spend time with the child may be included in extraordinary circumstances.
• Telephone and internet costs - the relevant portion of these costs can form part of the costs to communicate with the child.
• Accommodation costs - accommodation costs must be reasonable and necessary to enable the parent to spend time with the child without being demeaning. Family-type accommodation is regarded as appropriate rather than a luxury hotel.

## Distinguishing the costs from necessary commitments for self-support


In some applications for a change to an assessment, the costs claimed may relate to accommodating the children at the payer's home. However, the costs must relate to the child rather than to the parent.


Example:The difference between renting a one-bedroom unit and a 3-bedroom unit to provide accommodation during substantial periods spent with the child.


Any costs relating to a parent's self-support must be separated from their overall costs. The Registrar will consider the proportion of the accommodation that relates to the children and the frequency of the time spent together.


## Do the high costs make it 'just and equitable' to change the assessment?


Once the high costs are established, and the fact that the costs significantly affect the cost of maintaining the child/ren is accepted, the Registrar must consider whether it would be just and equitable to change the assessment. The decision must also be otherwise proper.


In considering if it would be just and equitable to change the assessment, the Registrar will consider any court orders made regarding the management of spending time with, or communicating with, the child, especially where the court order directs that costs be shared. The Registrar will also take into account any relevant parenting plan. The Registrar will also consider other elements including:

• the child's need to be supported by, and spend time with, or communicate with, both parents
• the contribution each parent makes to the costs
• the necessary commitments of each parent relative to their respective capacity to contribute
• any hardship which would be caused to either parent
• any other relevant factor.

A parent's actual income in the relevant period as well as their ATI (3.1.1) will be considered. If the parent's current income is different from their ATI, this will also be a factor for the Registrar to weigh up in considering whether it would be just and equitable to change the assessment.


If the parent's income is high and all of their necessary costs are met (including the costs to enable them to spend time with, or communicate with, the child) then the costs, however high, might not significantly affect their capacity to support the child and it may not be just and equitable to change the assessment.


## The types of decisions that reflect the high costs


One of the principles of child support is that parents should generally meet the costs of their children according to their financial capacity. Where the costs of the children are high due to the special circumstances of the case, it is often appropriate to share those higher costs between the parents in a similar way.


The Registrar may find it is not appropriate to deduct (or add) all of the costs over the 5% threshold from (or to) the child support payable, if this would shift the whole of the obligation to pay the high costs from one parent to the other. The Registrar may therefore allocate the costs (over the 5% threshold) to the parents according to their percentage of the combined child support income (3.1) if the:

• receiving parent is meeting the additional costs, by adding the paying parent's share to the child support payable, or
• paying parent is meeting the additional costs, by deducting the receiving parent's share from the child support payable.

Example:A paying parent has established high contact costs of $4,000 and they are meeting these costs in full. The paying parent has an ATI of $60,000 so the threshold amount is $3,000 (that is, 5% of $60,000). The total high contact costs of $4,000 are reduced by the 5% threshold amount ($4,000 - $3,000 = $1,000).


The receiving parent's share of the combined child support income is 30% so their share of the high costs is $300 (that is, 30% of $1,000). As the paying parent is meeting the additional costs, the receiving parent's $300 share of the high contact costs is deducted from the child support payable of $6,000. The paying parent therefore has a reduced child support payable amount of $5,700.


The Registrar may increase a parent's self-support amount (1.1.S.20) to reflect the amount that that person would have to earn to meet the costs that exceed the 5% threshold (Houlihan and Houlihan(1991) FLC 92-248). Because costs in excess of the 5% threshold are measured over the CSP, these costs must be adjusted to an annual figure before being grossed up to obtain a pre-tax figure. This is done by dividing the costs in excess of the threshold by the number of days in the CSP and multiplying that amount by 365. The Registrar will then gross up the parent's annualised costs in excess of the 5% threshold, using the appropriate marginal tax rate based on the parent's taxable income (1.1.T.20).


The above approaches allow the parent to use other administrative options such as an estimate of current income and to have changes in care taken into account if necessary. In other cases, the circumstances of the case may indicate an alternative type of decision is appropriate, especially if there are a number of reasons included in the application for a change to the assessment.


## Duration of a change of assessment for this reason


The length of time the decision will apply depends on the circumstances of the case. If there is a regular pattern with consistent expenditure, the decision may be of a longer duration than a case where it is irregular and expenditure varies greatly from period to period. Where a pattern is not established but there has been an order of a court in relation to the issue of time spent or communication with the child, a decision for a shorter duration might be made.

# 5.2.2 Reason 2 - the special needs of the child


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by the child's special needs.


If the parent's capacity to support the child is significantly affected by the special needs of any other child or another person that the parent has a duty to maintain, this can be addressed under change of assessment Reason 9 (5.2.10).

## Grounds for departure under Reason 2


A party can apply to change the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) if in the special circumstances of the case, the cost of meeting the special needs of a child significantly affects the costs of maintaining the child (CSA Act section 117(2)(b)(ia)).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


The term 'special needs' is not defined in the legislation. There must be some evidence that the needs of the child relate to a condition or disability that is out of the ordinary. These special needs can be because of a physical, mental or learning disability or because of a special talent or ability of the child. They may result in costs that are essential or desirable for the child's welfare that are outside the ordinary costs of a child that can be met from an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) (Lightfoot v Hampson(1996) FLC 92-663).

• A condition that is distinct from the usual childhood illnesses suffered by a child may be a condition that is out of the ordinary.
• A long-term or short-term physical, mental or learning disability may constitute such a condition.
• The costs of orthodontic treatment that is considered to be essential or desirable for a child's welfare may be significant enough to affect the costs of maintaining the child.

In some cases, needs which arise from such special talents that are likely to lead to particular success or prominence may be considered 'special needs'. Gifted sports people could be considered to have special needs (Blamey and Blamey(1995) FLC 92-554).


A child's special needs will often be a fact accepted by both the payer (1.1.P.40) and payee (1.1.P.30). However, in cases where there is a dispute, the person who seeks to rely on this reason will need to provide documentation, such as medical evidence, to substantiate their claim. Similarly, the party making the application will need to provide evidence of the net expenditure associated with the special need, unless it is clear that the respondent accepts the other party's claim.


## When are the costs of maintaining a child significantly affected?


The additional costs of maintaining a child with special needs should be readily quantifiable.


If a child has special needs, the Registrar will consider whether the costs of maintaining the child are higher because of the costs related to the special needs. The special needs must involve a cost that is additional to the normal needs of a child that are expected to be met from the child support assessment.


The fact that the child suffers from a severe disability or has a special ability does not, in itself, mean that an assessment should be changed. The overall test is whether the costs of supporting that child are significantly different from those faced by most other parents. If the costs are only slightly higher than usual they might not be considered to significantly affect a parent's ability to provide financial support for the child.


In some cases, a child may suffer from an illness that is easy and relatively inexpensive to treat but, because of complications, the expenses associated with that condition are significant in the short-term. In other cases, the child may have a disability but the costs associated with that disability are nominal in terms of the parent's out-of-pocket expenses. This may be because the parent receives significant subsidies from the government in relation to medication, therapy or treatment or because another person meets the expenses associated with the condition. This may include payments or financial assistance received under the National Disability Insurance Scheme in respect of the child. Such payments or subsidies will be taken into account when determining the net expenses incurred by the parent.


## Do the additional costs make it 'just and equitable' to change the assessment?


Once it is established that the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected, the Registrar must consider whether it would be just and equitable (5.3) to the child, the payer, and the payee and otherwise proper (5.4) to make a particular determination (CSA Act section 98C(1)(b)(ii)).


If a special need exists and it significantly adds to the costs of maintaining a child, the Registrar must decide on the amount by which those costs exceed the usual or expected costs.


In determining whether a change to the assessment is just and equitable, the Registrar will look at all the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of both parents and the child. The Registrar will consider the parent's capacity to meet the additional expenses, given the assessed rate of child support (1.1.C.60). Either parent may be able to contribute towards the child's additional expenses, taking into account their individual financial circumstances.


This may include consideration of non-taxable carer payments received by the parent including carer allowance or one-off payments such as carer supplement, child disability assistance payment or carer adjustment payments. These payments are intended to assist with the direct and indirect costs of the child's disability. While payments or financial assistance received under the National Disability Insurance Scheme as part of a child's support package are not counted as income for child support, the Registrar will consider them to determine the net expenses incurred by the parent.


If the parent's current income is different from his or herATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20), this will also be a factor for the Registrar to weigh up in considering whether it would be just and equitable to change the assessment.


## The types of changes to an assessment that reflect the special needs of a child


The type of decision made will depend upon who is bearing the costs of the child's special needs. The final decision will also depend on the circumstances of the case and any other reasons under consideration.


If the payee is meeting those expenses, it would usually be fair to apportion a percentage of responsibility for those costs to each parent according to their share of the combined child support income (1.1.C.190), and increase the assessment by the annual amount of the payer's share of the costs.


Where a payer is bearing the costs of the child's special needs, it may be appropriate to apportion the additional cost between the parents according to their respective shares of the combined child support income, and decrease the amount of child support payable by the payee's share of the costs.


Alternatively, it may be appropriate to adjust their self-support amount (1.1.S.20) to reflect the amount that the payer would have to earn to meet the costs of the special needs of the child (using the method inHoulihan and Houlihan(1991) FLC 92-248). This allows the parents to use other administrative processes, if necessary, such as an estimate of current income. This approach will not produce a fair result in every case, as the value of the financial relief to the parent can be low, but it may be used when this reason is considered in isolation from other reasons.


## The effect of a change to an assessment on any means-tested assistance from government


Generally, any child support received by a payee is considered to be maintenance, and may affect the payee's entitlement toFTBPart A.


Maintenance that is paid specifically for the child's disability expenses is not assessable under theMIT. However, not all special needs costs are considered disability expenses for FTB purposes. Disability expenses are those relating to a physical, psychological or intellectual disability or a child's learning difficulties. If a decision is made to increase a child support assessment based wholly or partly on the child's special needs, the notice of decision will clearly identify the component that relates to those special needs. The payee can then ask Centrelink to consider whether that amount should be disregarded for FTB purposes.


## How long will a decision to change the assessment under this reason apply?


The period of time the decision covers will depend upon how long the child is likely to require additional financial support. If a child has an ongoing or chronic illness or condition, the decision to change the assessment may be for a long time. If the special need relates to a short-term condition (for example, orthodontic work or treatment for an injury or a specific activity such as a sports camp) the change may be for a shorter time.


## The interaction of Reason 2 & the provisions for credit of non-agency payments


A payer who has less than regular care (1.1.R.50) of all of the children of the assessment who makes certain types of payments to third parties, including fees for essential medical and dental services for a child, is generally able to have those payments credited towards their liability to pay child support for that child, even if the payee did not intend that the amount be for child support. However, this option is not generally available if the Registrar has already taken into account those costs met by the payer in making a decision to reduce or refuse to change the assessment. See7.5.1and7.5.2for further information on non-agency payments.

# 5.2.3 Reason 3 - high costs of caring for, educating or training the child in the manner expected by the parents


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) if the costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected by the costs of caring for, educating or training the child in the way both parents expected.

• Would a change be just and equitable, & otherwise proper?
• The types of decisions that reflect the high costs
• Reason 3 & interactions with non-agency payments

## Grounds for departure under Reason 3


An assessment can be changed if, in the special circumstances of the case, the costs of maintaining a child are significantly affected because the child is being cared for, educated or trained in the manner that was expected by their parents (CSA Act section 117(2)(b)(ii)).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


The party applying for a change to their assessment has to show that there are additional costs involved in maintaining the child because of the parents' expectation as to how the child will be cared for, educated or trained. The ordinary costs incurred in raising a child will not be considered under this reason as those costs do not set a particular case apart from other cases in a way that establishes special circumstances.


Example:The usual costs associated with a child attending a government school would not normally constitute special circumstances.


## Is the child being cared for, educated or trained in a manner expected by his or her parents?


The most common application for this reason involves the payment of private school fees and whether the child is being educated in a manner expected by the parents. However, this reason can apply to education and/or training outside the school environment.


Other costs required for the care (1.1.C.10), education or training expected by the parents may also be considered where they are above what would normally be incurred. For example, the costs of uniforms or computer requirements of some private schools may be significantly higher than would be incurred at a state school.


In cases involving school fees and other associated costs, the Registrar will generally determine whether both parents expected the child to be educated in the way outlined in the application. The Registrar will also consider the financial situation of both parents. The fact that a payer (1.1.P.40) can afford to pay the fees, or is a wealthy person, is not in itself a reason for imposing a liability to contribute to school fees (Mee, J.F. and Ferguson, P.J. (Formerly Mee)(1986) FLC 91-716).


Where a parent expected the child to attend a private school they will be liable to contribute to the fees to the extent that they have the financial capacity. Where a parent did not expect the child to attend a private school, they will not be liable to contribute to the fees unless there are reasons relating to the child's welfare that mean that the child should attend a private school (and the costs would then relate to the child's special needs - see Reason 2 (5.2.2)).


In deciding whether the reason is established the Registrar will consider the type of education expected by both parents for the child, rather than any particular school intended by the parents (Wild v Ballard(1997) FLC 92-771).


The Registrar will also consider the circumstances at the time of separation. If the child was attending a particular private school, or was participating in a particular extracurricular activity, then this element will usually be established. If not, evidence of the parents' expectation would need to be provided, for example, the payment of fees, evidence of joint enrolment, contribution towards a scholarship fund to pay private school fees. The parents' expectation can be created at any time, not just during the period that the parents lived together.


If the parents had an expectation that the child should attend a particular type of primary school, the Registrar will not automatically presume that the same expectation automatically applies to a similar type of secondary school (1.1.S.10). However in cases where it is clear that the parents' expected a child to receive a certain type of secondary education, the Registrar may find the reason established.


When considering the parents' expectations, the Registrar will take into account all relevant evidence. In some cases, evidence may exist that clearly indicates that the parents jointly expected to educate their child in the private school system. However, if more recent evidence indicates that the parents' expectations have changed, the older evidence may be irrelevant.


Example:Prior to separation, Max and Pepper enrol their child in a private school. After separation, Max ceases payments for the private school fees and Pepper applies for a change of assessment under Reason 3. Pepper provides a copy of the enrolment form signed by both parents in support of their application. Max responds to the application and provides a copy of a parenting plan the parents entered into after separation. The parenting plan clearly states that the child will be educated at a public school, thereby providing more recent evidence about the parents' expectations regarding schooling. In this instance, the reason would not be established.


## When is the cost of maintaining the child significantly affected?


The costs of educating or training a child in accordance with the expectations of the parents are usually readily identifiable and verifiable.


Once the costs have been calculated, the Registrar will consider whether the additional amount is significant in relation to the assessed costs of the child (1.1.C.210). If the additional amount is small in comparison with the assessed costs, the Registrar may find that the costs of maintaining the child are not significantly affected and that there is no reason to change the assessment (CSA Act section 117(2)(b)(ii)).


Example:Royle and Misty have agreed to send Annie to a private school. The cost of Annie's attendance is only slightly higher than it would cost for Annie to attend a government school, and the additional amount is only a small proportion of Annie's existing assessed costs. The Registrar finds that the costs of maintaining Annie are not significantly affected by the costs of educating Annie in the manner intended by the parents.


## Would a change be just and equitable, & otherwise proper?


If the reason is established, the Registrar must consider whether it would be just and equitable (5.3) to the child, the payer, and the payee (1.1.P.30) and otherwise proper (5.4) to make a particular determination (CSA Act section 98C(1)(b)(ii)).


The Registrar will consider the financial circumstances of both parents and decide whether the child's needs, including the additional costs, can be met as part of the costs of the child as assessed under the formula (as can be the case where the assessed costs of the child are already high). Either parent may be able to contribute towards the child's additional expenses taking into account that parent's circumstances.


It is important to maintain the expectations of both parents and the primary purpose of the CSA Act in ensuring that children receive a proper level of financial support from both parents. This has to be balanced against the capacity of either or both parents to meet those expectations. Changes to the financial circumstances of either parent may mean that earlier expectations for a child's care or education are no longer possible.


While the reason may be established, a parent may claim that the child has been enrolled, without their consent, in a more expensive school than was initially agreed. If this claim is supported with evidence, the Registrar will take this into consideration when making any change to the assessment.


## The types of decisions that reflect the high costs


### Payee is meeting the costs


If the payee is meeting the additional costs, a decision will usually increase the child support (1.1.C.60) liability by an appropriate proportion of those additional costs. The length of time and stability of the education costs can determine the period of time that any change to the assessment will apply.


### Payer is meeting the costs


Where the payer is meeting the costs, it may be appropriate to reduce the assessment to reflect that the payer is directly meeting more than their appropriate share of the costs.


An alternative approach that can be used for cases that are registered as agency collect (1.1.A.50) is to increase the assessment and for the payer to claim credit (as non-agency payments (7.5.1)) for any payments that they make directly to third parties in relation to training and education costs for the child. The Registrar will still need to be satisfied that the parties mutually intended that these payments were for child support for the child when a payer makes a claim for a credit.


If mutual intention is not satisfied, the payer may make a claim for credit under the prescribed non-agency payment provisions (7.5.2) if the payer had less than regular care (1.1.R.50) of all of the children at the time the payment was made. They must also have less than regular care at the time of crediting the prescribed non-agency payment against the liability.


Policy reference:CS Guide7.5.1Non-agency payments,7.5.2Prescribed non-agency payments


## Reason 3 & interactions with non-agency payments


A payer who has less than regular care of all of the children of the assessment who makes certain types of payments to third parties, including fees charged by a school or preschool for a child, is generally able to have those payments credited towards their liability to pay child support for that child, even if the payee did not intend that the amount be for child support. However, this option is not generally available if the Registrar has already taken into account those costs met by the payer in making a decision to reduce, or refuse to change the assessment.

# 5.2.4 Reason 4 - income of the child


## Context


The usual formula assessment (1.1.F.20) provisions do not take into account the child's personal income when calculating the rate of child support (1.1.C.60) payable by a parent (1.1.P.10) for that child.


A parent or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is unfair because of the child's income, earning capacity, property or financial resources.

## Grounds for departure


A parent or non-parent carer can make an application to change the child support assessment if they consider that the income, earning capacity, property or financial resources of the child result in an unjust and inequitable level of child support under the child support assessment.


The Registrar cannot end a child support assessment because of the income earned by an eligible child. However, there may be a reason for changing an assessment if the administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support results in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child because of the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child (section 117(2)(c)(i)).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


Each case has to be considered in light of the individual circumstances of the child and the parents. Substantial income and/or assets, whether or not directly under the control of the child, will be relevant when deciding whether the assessment is unfair.


The Registrar will consider the financial resources of the child in the context of the income and asset position of both parents. In most cases, there will be some overlap between these considerations and consideration of what is just and equitable.


Where there is a change to the assessment due to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child, the change will usually have effect until the child turns 18, or the end of the school year in which the child turns 18, subject to an application under CSA Act section 151B (2.5.3).


## Minimal earnings


Minimal earnings are generally not regarded as a reason to change an assessment of child support (Mee, J.F. and Ferguson, P.J. (Formerly Mee).(1986) FLC 91-716).


The Registrar will not usually consider that the following types of income affect the financial responsibility of the parents:

• income derived from casual work in holidays or after school hours
• gifts of small amounts of money
• pocket money.

The Registrar must disregard an income-tested pension, allowance or benefit (1.1.I.35) received by the child (or by another person on behalf of the child) when considering that child's income, earning capacity, property and financial resources (section 117(7)).


## Significant income


If a parent applies for a change of assessment because their child receives more than a minimal income, the Registrar will consider whether that income is significant enough to warrant a change to an assessment. This will depend upon the income of the child, the financial circumstances of the parents, the amount of child support payable under the assessment and the circumstances of the case. However, generally the Registrar will not be satisfied that a child's income is sufficient to warrant a change to the assessment unless that income is regular and exceeds the equivalent of the maximum basic rate of youth allowance (SS Guide5.1.1.20) payable to a child under 18 years of age living at home plus the income free threshold applicable to students/Australian Apprentices (SS Guide4.2.8.50,4.2.8.55). This means, for example, that as at 1 January 2025, a child would generally need to earn or receive a gross income of at least $469.15 per week for the earnings to be considered so significant as to be capable of affecting the assessment.


This figure is only a guide, and in certain circumstances, the Registrar may determine that the child's income is significant even if it is below this amount, or is insignificant even though it is above this amount. The figure will change periodically in line with changes to payment rates for youth allowance. The Registrar will also consider the needs of the child including the costs incurred by the child, or the parents, in earning the income, for example, transport and clothing costs.


For example, where a child earns $469.15 per week but incurs high transport costs, and the payer has an adequate disposable income, it might not be considered fair to change the assessment. Alternatively, if the payer has a low income and the payee is in a comfortable financial position, then it might be considered fair to change the assessment.


## Just and equitable & otherwise proper


If there is a reason to change the assessment, the Registrar must consider whether it would be just, equitable and otherwise proper to the child, the payer, and the payee to make a decision to change the assessment (section 117(4) to (9)).


## The types of decisions that can be made


The decision will depend on the circumstances of the case and any other reasons under consideration.


Where the assessment covers a number of eligible children, the significant income of one child may be sufficient to establish the reason in respect of that child. It may be appropriate to reflect the income of the child by reducing the costs of that child used in the assessment, which will reduce the total child support payable.

# 5.2.5 Reason 5 - money, goods or property received by the child, the payee or a third person


## Context


The child support (1.1.C.60) scheme provides that payment of child support shall be made by periodic payments to a payee (1.1.P.30) for the day-to-day care of a child. The payee then determines how that money is spent. However, there may be cases where payments have been made for the benefit of a child, outside the child support assessment (1.1.C.70), that should be taken into account when deciding how much child support should be paid.


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the child support assessment is unfair because the payer (1.1.P.40) has paid or transferred money, goods or property to the child, the payee, or a third party for the benefit of the child.


CSA Actsection 98C, section 98E, section 98S, section 117(2)(c)(ii), section 117(4) to (9)

## Grounds for departure


There may be a reason for a change to an assessment when there are special circumstances because of a payment of money, or transfer or settlement of property made (or to be made) by the payer (CSA Act section 117(2)(c)(ii)). The payment or transfer can be to the child, the payee or to any other person for the benefit of the child.


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


A party can apply to change their child support assessment if they think that a payment or transfer of property that has been made, or is to be made, should be considered. The party needs to show that the payment or transfer results in an unjust and inequitable level of child support under the child support assessment.


Payments for the benefit of a child can include:

• non-agency payments (7.5.1)
• other payments for the benefit of the child
• payments made during a period when child support wasn't collected by the Registrar that exceed the child support liability
• a transfer or settlement of property made for the benefit of the child, made to the child, the payee or to a third party.

The value of a payment or transfer should be able to be identified.


### Transfer or settlement of property


Any transfer or settlement of property has to be looked at in relation to any order made by a court or any agreement between the parents regarding property. The Registrar will avoid undermining the property settlement or any related agreement entered into by the parents.


Generally, the Registrar will not be satisfied that a transfer of property to the other parent was made for the benefit of the child, unless the order or agreement specifically identifies the proportion and states that the transfer was made for the benefit of the child. However, where a parent can establish, with adequate evidence, that the payee received a higher share of the property or a payment for the benefit of the children, the Registrar will consider whether the transfer or payment makes the child support assessment unjust and inequitable.


The Registrar will consider any agreement or order that provides for the children, but it is not, in itself, conclusive evidence that a change should be made to the assessment (Mark Sloan Father and Julie Maree Sloan Mother(1994) FLC 92-507). Where express provisions have been made, it may be necessary for a court to consider the matter if the change of assessment process cannot properly consider all the relevant factors.


Where there has been an informal distribution of assets, the change of assessment process should not operate as a means of clarifying the terms of the agreement, or intentions of the parents, in respect of the arrangement. In these cases, the Registrar will refuse to make a change of assessment decision as the issues are too complex (CSA Act section 98E).


However, in cases where the facts are simple, an application for a change to the assessment can be successful and the assessment can be changed to recognise the property settlement.


## How does this reason relate to non-agency payments?


An application to credit a non-agency payment may be a more suitable way to recognise that payments have been made. (See7.5.1for more information.) However, the credit of a non-agency payment or a refusal to credit does not necessarily mean that an application for a change to the assessment cannot be made (Kornacki v Lynch(1998) FLC 98-000). In that case, a payment of school fees in advance made prior to the commencement of the child support liability provided a reason to change the assessment.


It may be more appropriate to apply for a change to an assessment (rather than the credit of a non-agency payment) if the parent is seeking an adjustment to their assessment for the future and for ongoing support rather than an immediate credit for payments that have been made. There may be other situations where the payment made does not qualify as a non-agency payment, for example, the payment was not made during a period when child support was collectable by the Registrar.


If a payer has uncredited amounts for prescribed non-agency payments, the payer can seek further relief through an application for a change to the assessment. The facts of the case have to be examined to see if the payment will be fully credited or credited in part or not at all. The value of the payment, the amount of the assessment and any credits recognised as non-agency payments need to be examined.


## Unjust and inequitable


The Registrar will determine if the assessment is unjust or inequitable because of the special circumstances. The question of unfairness depends on the particular facts of the case.


An uninvited, voluntary or excessive payment for the benefit of the child by a parent, outside the child support assessment, should not affect the payee's entitlement to receive child support to meet the day-to-day needs of the child (Strauss and Strauss(1998) FLC 92-797). A parent is not legally required to pay more than the amount set by the child support assessment. However, a parent may choose to pay additional amounts of child support without any expectation of a change being made to the assessment.


The Registrar will consider the amount of child support payable under the assessment, the amount of the payment or transfer and the requirement that children receive periodic payments for their day-to-day needs.


Although a payment might have been made prior to an assessment being raised it does not prevent the Registrar deciding that the assessment is unfair.


## The types of decisions that can be made


It may be fair to reflect the amount of the transaction by adjusting components of the child support formula (1.1.C.110) to reduce the assessment for the paying parent by an appropriate amount.


Alternatively, an annual amount of child support may be set.


Generally, in cases where there is a change to the assessment in relation to the payment of money or transfer of property, the change will only affect the assessment for a short period. In determining whether the change should continue until the child turns 18, the Registrar will consider the reasons for the transaction. The decision will depend on the circumstances of the case and any other reasons under consideration.

# 5.2.6 Reason 6 - high costs of child care


## Context


A parent (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer can apply to change their child support assessment (1.1.C.70) in special circumstances if they consider that the costs of maintaining a child under 12 years of age are significantly affected by the high costs of child care.


While this mostly applies to payments made to registered child care providers, it may also apply to payments made to a person (such as a grandparent) that provides care (1.1.C.10) for the child.


CSA Actsection 5, section 44, section 98C, section 98S, section 117(2)(b)(ib), section 117(3A), section 117(3B), section 117(3C), section 117(4) to (9)


## On this page

• Grounds for departure under Reason 6
• High child care costs - costs incurred by a parent
• High child care costs - costs incurred by a non-parent carer
• Have the costs been incurred?
• Are the costs reasonable & necessary?
• Do the costs significantly affect the costs of the maintaining child?
• The kinds of decisions that reflect high costs of child care

## Grounds for departure under Reason 6


An assessment can be changed if in the special circumstances of the case the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because of high child care costs in relation to the child (section 117(2)(b)(ib)).


Only net child care expenses are taken into account (that is, less any child care subsidy or additional child care subsidy that is deducted by the child care provider from the fees).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman (1992) FLC 92-279).


Before an assessment can be changed, the Registrar must be satisfied that all of the following elements exist:

• in relation to costs incurred by a parent the child care costs are only high if they total more than 5% of the parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) for theCSP(2.4) (1.1.C.150) (section 117(3B))
• in relation to costs incurred by a non-parent carer the child care costs are only high if they total at least 25% of theCOTC(1.1.C.210) for the CSP (section 117(3C))
• the costs of maintaining the child are significantly affected because of high child care costs (section 117(2)(b)(ib))
• the costs must be incurred by a parent or non-parent carer (section 117(3A)(a))
• the child must be younger than 12 years of age at the start of the CSP (section 117(3A)(b)).

If a reason to change the assessment is established the Registrar is required to consider whether it would be just and equitable (5.3) and otherwise proper (5.4) to make a particular decision.


## High child care costs - costs incurred by a parent


Child care costs incurred by a parent are not high unless they are more than 5% of the parent's ATI for the CSP (section 117(3B)).


Example 1:A parent, Antonio, has child care costs of $3,000 over a 15-month CSP (457 days). Antonio's ATI for the CSP is $40,000.


### Calculating if the child care costs are high, using Example 1.


Step 1: Calculate the parent’s ATI


The Registrar will use the parent's ATI amount for the CSP in which the child care costs are, or will be incurred. This will be the income for the last relevant financial year (1.1.L.10), unless the Registrar:

• calculates the threshold using the parent's estimated ATI (3.4)
• calculates the threshold using the parent’s post-separation income (1.1.P.90) (3.5), or
• uses the parent's ATI amount that has been varied bya child support agreement (Part 6)a court order (2.5.5), ora previous change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision (5.5).
• a child support agreement (Part 6)
• a court order (2.5.5), or
• a previous change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision (5.5).

Step 2: Calculate the parent’s CSP income


The parent’s ATI is divided by 365 and then multiplied by the number of days in the CSP.


The 15-month CSP has 457 days.


($40,000 ÷ 365 days) × 457 days = $50,082


### Calculating if the child care costs are high if a parent’s income has changed, using Example 1


The Registrar will use the following method to calculate whether the parent's child care costs are high in a case where the parent's ATI changes within the CSP (for example, because the parent lodged an estimate of his or her income within the CSP). When ATI changes, the CSP will be separated into CSP sub-periods according to the dates that the parent’s income changes.


The CSP starts on 1 January 2024 and finishes on 1 April 2025 based on income of $40,000.


Antonio lodges an income estimate of $30,000 on 1 August 2024.


CSP sub period 1 is 1 January to 31 July 2024 – 213 days.


CSP sub-period 2 is 1 August 2024 to 1 April 2025 – 244 days.


Step 2: Calculate the CSP sub-period income for each sub-period.


The parent’s ATI for each sub-period is divided by 365 and then multiplied by the number of days in the CSP sub-period. Subperiod 1 – ($40,000 ÷ 365 days) × 213 days = $23,342.


## High child care costs - costs incurred by a non-parent carer


Child care costs incurred by a non-parent carer are not high unless they are more than 25% of the COTC for the CSP (section 117(3C)), in which the child care costs are, or will be incurred.


Example 2:A non-parent carer, Artamon, has annual child care costs of $2,500 for Calista who is 8 years old. The combined child support income of Calista's parents for the CSP is $40,000.


### Calculating if the child care costs are high, using Example 2


The Registrar will use the following method utilising Example 2 to calculate whether the non-parent carer's child care costs are high in a case where the COTC change within the CSP (for example, because one of the child's parents lodged an estimate of his or her income within the CSP). When COTC changes, the CSP will be separated into CSP sub-periods according to the dates that the COTC changes.


### Calculating if the child care costs are high if COTC change, using Example 2


The CSP starts on 1 January 2024 and finishes on 1 April 2025. The COTC are $6,800.


The COTC change on 1 August 2024 to $5,000.


CSP sub period 1 is 1 January to 31 July 2024 – 213 days.


CSP sub-period 2 is 1 August 2024 to 1 April 2025 – 244 days


Step 2: Calculate the CSP sub-period COTC for each sub-period.


The COTC for each sub-period is divided by 365 and then multiplied by the number of days in the CSP sub-period.


Subperiod 1 – ($6,800 ÷ 365 days) × 213 days = $3,968.


Subperiod 2 – ($5,000 ÷ 365 days) × 244 days = $3,342.


Artamon’s annual child care costs are $2,500.


($2,500 ÷ 365 days) × 457 days = $3,130


## Have the costs been incurred?


A parent or non-parent carer should substantiate the costs incurred when making an application for a change to the assessment. Evidence can include enrolment forms for child care, holding fees and similar documentation. Costs are incurred if there is a definite commitment to the expenditure even if an actual payment has not been made. However, there must be a reasonable expectation that the cost will be incurred.


## Are the costs reasonable & necessary?


There should be an element of necessity in incurring the child care costs, for example, work-related purposes. This extends to parents or non-parent carers attempting to join the workforce, including those who are undertaking study, training or education. It may also extend to non-work related purposes such as a need for respite, particularly in relation to a non-parent carer.


The Registrar has to determine the reasonableness of the costs claimed. Examples of reasonable child care costs include:

• day care centre costs
• before and after school care costs.

Payments to a private care provider, such as a nanny or grandparent, may be reasonable. If the costs are significantly higher than other available care, the Registrar will consider whether the higher costs are necessary in the particular circumstances.


## Do the costs significantly affect the costs of maintaining the child?


A parent or non-parent carer must be able to show that the total costs of maintaining the child are high because the cost of child care for that child is high. If the cost of child care is high but the total cost of maintaining the child is no greater than usual there may not be a reason to change the assessment. The costs of maintaining the child are considered in the context of the financial circumstances of the parents.


## The types of decisions that reflect high costs of child care


If the Registrar decides that the child support assessment should be changed because of high costs of child care, the COTC may be increased by the total net child care costs, for distribution between the parents according to their share of the combined income. Adjusting that component of the formula assessment (1.1.F.20) allows the parents to use other administrative processes such as an estimate of income, if necessary.


Other kinds of decisions (for example, adjusting the annual rate (1.1.A.70) or other components of the formula) may be appropriate in some circumstances.

# 5.2.7 Reason 7 - necessary commitments of self-support


## Context


One of the objects of the CSA Act is that the level of financial support provided by parents (1.1.P.10) for their children should be determined according to their capacity to provide financial support, and, in particular, that parents with similar capacity should provide similar amounts of support (section 4(2)(a)).


There can be a reason to change an assessment if the capacity of either parent to provide financial support for their child is significantly reduced because of their commitments which are necessary to enable them to support themselves (section 117(2)(a)(iii)(A)).


Note:Expenses incurred to enable a parent to spend time with, or communicate with, the child are not included under this reason. Where those costs are necessary to enable contact with the child, they can form the basis of an application under Reason 1 (5.2.1).


CSA Actsection 4(2)(a), section 117(2)(a)(iii)(A)


## On this page

• Grounds for departure under Reason 7
• Necessary commitments for self-support
• Significant reduction of capacity to support child
• Types of decisions to change an assessment

## Grounds for departure


A parent or non-parent carer can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if a parent's capacity to support the child is significantly reduced by their commitments to support themselves.


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


A parent must show that there is something special or unusual about their case. The mere fact that a parent's expenses exceed their income is unlikely to amount to a special circumstance. The desire for expenditure on hobbies, entertainment, and holidays does not amount to a special circumstance.


## Necessary commitments for self-support


A parent must have necessary commitments or expenses for self-support for the reason to be established. In all cases, the test is whether the expense:

• is necessary for a reasonable standard of living
• is unavoidable or compulsory.
• examine the nature of the expenditure (for example, the kind of expenditure and the reasons for the expenditure) to decide whether it is a 'necessary commitment'
• decide if the amount of the expenditure is 'necessary'.

The use of the word 'necessary' is not intended to produce an unrealistically low standard of living for parents (Gyselman and Gyselman (1992) FLC 92-279). In that case, the court went on to make the following comments:


'Where families separate, it is likely that in a number of cases that there will be insufficient income to support the 2 households at their prior standard or at a reasonable standard. Consequently, it is a matter of the balancing of competing values, namely the obligation of the absent parent to continue to support his children with, on the other hand, the need for the parent to continue to maintain himself at a reasonable level. It is clear from the objects of the CSA Act that there is an intention to reverse what was seen to be the undesirable lack of emphasis upon the former of those commitments in the past, but it was not intended to completely reverse that situation. It is a question of reasonable balance in the individual case.'


Expenditure which may be considered necessary includes:

• reasonable costs of food
• reasonable costs of accommodation
• household essentials
• clothing
• necessary transport
• necessary health costs.

All expenses should be substantiated with appropriate documentary evidence. The necessity of the cost will depend on the facts of the case.


### Health costs


To support their claim for consideration of necessary health costs, a parent should provide evidence that includes medical or dental reports, letters or other evidence from their treating doctor to confirm their essential treatment requirements, as well as evidence of the net cost following health fund and taxation rebates or any financial assistance provided under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


Generally, health costs accounted for under Reason 7 will have already been incurred and applications will be supported by evidence of accounts paid and relevant rebates or assistance received under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. However, the Registrar will also consider anticipated health costs where there is a reasonable expectation that the cost will be incurred.


Supporting evidence of anticipated health costs may include (but is not limited to):

• proposed treatment and/or payment plan or National Disability Insurance Scheme plan
• evidence of estimated costs
• evidence of deposit paid
• a quote or documentation of expected health fund or taxation rebates or financial assistance to be provided under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

Private health insurance contributions will not generally be considered necessary. However, the expense may be taken into account where the parent would have to pay a higher Medicare levy if they did not have private health insurance. Private health insurance may also be necessary if a parent has a medical condition.


### The effect of a property settlement or agreement


An order or agreement relating to a property settlement that requires one parent to assume liability for a debt is unlikely to amount to a special circumstance. However, the responsibility of one parent for debts pending property settlement may amount to a special circumstance.


Where property settlement has not been made, the Registrar will consider:

• who exercises control of the relevant assets, for example, it is less likely to be fair to change the assessment where the parent retains control of the asset
• whether a property settlement is likely to occur within a short period. If so, it may be appropriate to change the rate of child support (1.1.C.60) for a short time pending property settlement and/or disposal of the asset.

### Establishing a new household


The costs of setting up a household or servicing a debt immediately after separation may also be a necessary commitment.


A parent leaving a former marital home will often incur costs in establishing a new residence or obtaining new accommodation. There may also be a variety of debts and obligations incurred during the former relationship that must be paid despite separation and continue to be paid by a parent.


These costs are considered necessary subject to:

• proof of the expense and that it is being paid
• the necessity of the expense
• the expense being reasonable (for example, no more than the minimum payment required if a periodic payment)
• the possibility of rearranging the commitment by refinancing, reducing payment, sale of the asset, etc.
• the period over which the expense will be incurred.

Parents earning extra money after separation can request that the extra income not be included in the calculation of their child support assessment (1.1.C.70). This is known as post-separation income (1.1.P.90) and assists parents with post-separation costs for a period of up to 3 years. If a post-separation income reduction has already been made, this will be relevant when deciding whether Reason 7 has been established.


### Other commitments


Payments such as contributions to compulsory superannuation or trade union membership will generally be accepted as necessary. Voluntary contributions to superannuation may not be necessary unless the applicant can establish that they are in an occupation where retirement takes place comparatively early and where compulsory contributions would be insufficient to provide a reasonable retirement income. Where the applicant is self-employed and is not entitled to employer contributions under the superannuation levy, it may be appropriate to allow superannuation payments at the rate of the levy applicable to the income.


Not every kind of contractual obligation will be 'necessary' (see below). The onus is on a parent to rearrange their affairs to financially support their child.


The Family Court held that the proper approach is to take into account unavoidable or compulsory expenses (such as taxation, Medicare levy and compulsory superannuation) together with necessary living expenses (Mee, J.F. and Ferguson, P.J. (Formerly Mee)(1986) FLC 91-716).


### 'Reasonable' costs & expenses


There are no definitive rules to help decide whether expenses are reasonable. Each case must be considered on its individual circumstances. What is reasonable in one case may be an excessive expenditure in other circumstances. However, a parent will need to show that:

• reasonable measures have been taken to reduce expenditure
• items related to setting up a new household include basic furniture and whitegoods rather than optional items such as a TV or other entertainment items
• the cost of the necessary item, such as a motor vehicle or accommodation, is what is required to meet the need rather than extravagant or luxurious items
• where the cost of the expenditure is tax deductible, this has been taken into account.

### Contractual commitments may not be necessary


A commitment that must be paid such as a mortgage, credit card repayment or personal loan will not automatically be considered to be necessary.


Example:Where a parent, knowing of their child support obligation, enters into a finance arrangement for a subscription television service or a mobile telephone, it would not be considered to be either necessary or a special circumstance.


Example:A parent's commitment to a new mortgage is not necessary if it affects their ability to meet a previously attainable child support obligation.


Example:A commitment related to acquiring an asset or a financial resource (for example, real property, shares or an insurance policy) for the future will not be 'necessary' (Alan Patrick Dwyer Father and Jeanette Anne Mcguire Mother(1993) FLC 92-420,Bassingthwaite and Leane(1993) FLC 92-410). Child support is intended to assist a payee (1.1.P.30) to meet the recurring, day-to-day and often pressing expenses of maintaining a child. A child is not expected to have a relatively low standard of living in the short term in anticipation of a future increase in their standard of living.


## Significant reduction of capacity to support child


Once a parent has established that there are special circumstances and that the expenses are necessary and reasonable, the third element is to consider whether they significantly reduce the parent's capacity to provide financial support for the child.


The Registrar will compare the expenses with the available income (and any other benefits or relevant financial resources). While financial assistance payable to the parent under the National Disability Insurance Scheme is not counted as income for child support, the Registrar will consider this assistance to determine the parent's net expenses and capacity to support the child. Where a parent's necessary living expenses significantly exceed the funds available to them, their capacity to provide financial support is likely to be significantly reduced, and the reason will be established.


## Types of decisions to change an assessment?


In most cases, short-term adjustments to the self-support amount (1.1.S.20) or the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support will be appropriate to enable a parent to refinance debts, reorganise their financial affairs, or dispose of assets.


Example:A parent who has a complex salary package involving fringe benefits prior to separation may require time to reorganise their affairs following separation.


Example:The costs necessarily incurred by a recently separated (1.1.S.30) parent in establishing a new home are unlikely to be a long term consideration.

# 5.2.8 Reason 8A - a parent's income, property & financial resources


## Context


A key object of the CSA Act is that children receive an appropriate level of support from both their parents (1.1.P.10), based on their parent’s financial capacity. It is also an object of the CSA Act that in parents with like financial capacity should provide like amounts of child support (1.1.C.60).


A child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is generally based on each parents'ATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20). Where, in the special circumstances of the case, a parent's financial capacity (ATI) is not adequately reflected in the child support assessment an application may be considered under this reason.


A parent’s financial capacity may be more or less than the income used because of their income, property and financial resources.


The Registrar can also initiate a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) using this reason. This is known as a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (5.6.2).

## Grounds for departure


There may be a reason for changing the assessment if, in the special circumstances of the case, the assessment of child support results in an unjust and inequitable level of financial support to be provided by the payer (1.1.P.40) for the child because of either parent's income, property and financial resources (CSA Act section 98C(2) and section 117(2)(c)(ia)). Income, property and financial resources which do not necessarily form part of a parent's ATI can be added to or excluded from a child support assessment (David George Carey Husband and Tracey Louise Carey Wife(1994) FLC 92-489).


The Registrar must disregard the income, property and financial resources of any person who does not have a duty to maintain the child (CSA Act section 117(7A)).


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


It will not usually be necessary to apply under this reason to have the components of ATI considered as they should already be taken into account.


A parent is able to make an estimate of income (3.4) to be used in their child support assessment if their estimated income is 85% or less than their ATI for the last relevant year of income (1.1.L.10). A parent's ability to make an estimate of income will therefore be considered before the Registrar will consider a change to the assessment under this reason. If an estimate of income is unable to be accepted because the estimate is not 85% or less than the parent's ATI, the Registrar will generally not be satisfied that the reduction in income alone constitutes a special circumstance.


Each application will be determined according to the individual circumstances of the case. However, there is a range of circumstances that may form the basis of an application under this reason. It may be that a parent:

• has substantial property but low ATI
• has legitimately arranged their financial affairs to minimise tax
• receives income which is not assessable or is exempt from tax, or
• received a lump sum payment that is not included in their ATI.

In some cases, a parent's financial circumstances or the issues associated with the case may be too complex to be determined by the Registrar. In these cases the Registrar may refuse to change the assessment (CSA Act section 98E).


## Additional income


Although a parent's ATI is used in the child support formula (1.1.C.110), the Registrar can look beyond this income when considering an application for a change of assessment. Where a parent receives income and they have paid no, or negligible, tax on that income, the Registrar may calculate the equivalent gross value of that income. This grossed-up income will be taken into account in deciding whether there is a reason to change the assessment.


## Additional property or financial resources


The Registrar can be satisfied that there are special circumstances if one parent has substantial property or financial resources that have not been properly taken into account in the child support assessment (Ross and McDermott(1998) FLC 98-003).


When making a decision under this reason, the Registrar will consider whether a parent has capacity to earn or derive additional income including a consideration of assets that do not produce, but are capable of producing, income.


## Unfair or unjust and inequitable assessment


Once the Registrar has established the reason, a decision must be made as to whether this produces an unfair result. This includes consideration of the parent's total financial circumstances and whether the ATI used in the assessment correctly reflects their capacity to support their children. It also includes comparison of any change in the parent's income against any change in the parent's commitments and expenditure from the time of the application (Ross and McDermott(1998) FLC 98-003).


If the Registrar finds that there is a discrepancy between the child support assessment and the income, property and financial resources of the parent, the extent of the discrepancy will also be considered before deciding whether or not the assessment produces an unfair result. In this sense, 'unjust and inequitable level of child support', is narrower than the 'just and equitable' elements under CSA Act section 98C.


Example:The Registrar may determine that a parent has an income that is marginally greater than their ATI but, overall, it does not render the assessment unjust and inequitable. Similarly, it may be established that a parent has property which does not produce an income but, overall, the value of the property does not render the assessment unjust and inequitable.


## Asset rich but income poor


In some cases a parent might have substantial property and assets but a low ATI used in the child support assessment. The Registrar may consider the parent's property and assets, as well as any income, in deciding the appropriate rate of child support to be paid (Amanda Jane Abela Applicant/Wife and Philip James Abela Respondent/Husband(1995) FLC 92-568andBendeich and Bendeich(1993) FLC 92-355).


The Registrar will take into account that child support is intended to meet the day-to-day needs of the child when considering a parent's capacity to contribute to supporting a child.


It is not sufficient for a parent to say that they are unable to pay child support because their assets produce little or no income or will only produce income at some point in the future. The Registrar will consider whether the parent has the capacity to restructure their financial affairs to produce an income stream from which to contribute to child support. In these cases, the Registrar may:

• identify the relevant assets, determine ownership of such assets and enquire as to any structures designed to divest assets
• consider whether the assets are income-producing assets and, if so, when such income will be produced
• ascertain the value of the assets
• ascertain the parent's ability to convert the assets, or some of the assets, to cash
• consider the parent's ability to finance their lifestyle, and
• consider the impact of any property settlement on the parent's assets.

The Registrar does not have to identify any specific source, property or asset from which a parent should meet the obligation to contribute to the support of the child. The Registrar need only consider the parent's financial resources as a whole, including any capacity to borrow against the assets (Alan Patrick Dwyer Father and Jeannete Anne McGuireMother (1993) FLC 92-420).


## Can property or financial resources be invested now to provide for a future capacity to pay child support?


In some cases a parent, who may have financial or capital resources, may claim that they should be able to invest those resources now in the expectation that they will be available to support the child in the future or be made available to the child on inheritance. Assessment of child support is intended to ensure that parents contribute to the day-to-day needs of the child (Alan Patrick Dwyer Father and Jeannete Anne McGuireMother (1993) FLC 92-420). It is not sufficient for a parent to say that they are in a different situation to a wage and salary earner, for example, because their income has been converted to, or is tied-up in, real estate or other assets. In these cases, the Registrar will decide whether the parent has a capacity to restructure their financial affairs to provide current financial support for the child.


## Low income from a family business


A parent who receives a low taxable income (1.1.T.20) from a family business may have access to additional financial resources, or alternatively they may have an additional earning capacity (5.2.9).


In determining the parent's financial resources, the Registrar may consider the following factors:

• Past or current ability to maintain a particular lifestyle and acquire assets
• Identification of additional benefits obtained from the business
• Whether or not the business has been structured to minimise a parent's income including: the degree of control which the parent has over the business or the person who is entitled to the profits of the business, or whether income splitting is occurring, and
• The person who actually does the work of the business.

The Registrar may determine that a parent's income is greater or lower than the amount upon which they have been assessed. Alternatively, the Registrar may decide that the parent's financial resources give the parent a greater capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child than is indicated by the assessment.


## Alienation of income & a 'corporate veil'


A reduction of a parent's ATI by alienation of personal services income or other income will result in an artificially reduced or increased child support liability.


Generally, income is alienated when the income generated or derived by a person is attributed to others and, consequently, reduces the first person's taxable income. Personal services income, or income derived through personal exertion, can be defined as income that an individual earns predominantly as a direct reward for their personal efforts. Personal services income paid to a company, trust or partnership is also alienation of income.


If a parent is involved in alienation of their personal services income, this may indicate that they have additional income or financial resources that make the current child support assessment unjust and inequitable.


TheATOhas a published view in respect of the taxation consequences of arrangements that seek to alienate a person's taxable income. The ATO may make decisions concerning these arrangements for the purposes of taxation legislation and may have regard to the principles outlined in their publications. The Registrar may consider these principles in deciding whether such arrangements exist but can make a different decision about how they should be treated for the purposes of the child support legislation.


Many of the concepts relating to alienation are based on the term 'personal services income'.


Some common examples of income from personal services are:

• salary and wages
• income derived by a professional person who practises on their own account without professional assistance
• income payable under a contract where the payment under the contract relates wholly or principally to the labour of the person concerned, and
• income derived by a professional sportsperson or entertainer through the exercise of their particular skills.

Where personal services income is included in the taxable income of people other than the person who earned it the ATO considers that the tax avoidance provisions apply to cancel any tax benefits (Income Tax Assessment Act 1936Part IV). If the ATO is satisfied that such an arrangement was entered into primarily, or predominantly, to avoid liability for income tax by the means of the splitting of income, then the arrangement will be ineffective for income tax purposes. The tax benefit arising out of the arrangements will be removed.


### Where incorporation does not reduce personal income


In certain circumstances the ATO accepts that interposing a company, trust or partnership has no adverse taxation effects. For example, the incorporation of a professional practice that does nothing more in relation to income tax than reduce a professional person's income by the amount of an appropriate superannuation cover.


A professional practitioner may operate through a trust structure provided that the trust structure achieves the same result for income tax purposes as an incorporated professional practice. The ATO requires that the professional practitioner be the sole beneficiary of the trust.


The Registrar will have regard to these principles in determining whether such arrangements exist but may make a different decision to that of the ATO about how the arrangements should be treated for the purposes of the parent's child support assessment.


### How the Registrar identifies income that is alienated


In determining whether personal services income has been alienated through a company, trust or partnership, the Registrar will consider the following factors:

• Nature of the parent's activities
• Extent to which the income depends upon the parent's own skill and judgment
• Extent to which the company's assets, or trust's assets, are used to derive the income
• Number of employees and others engaged in the income-producing activity
• Time at which the company, trust or partnership was established, and
• Any other relevant matters.

### Where are the ATO's views on alienation of income found?


The following publications are available on theATO's Legal Database.

• IT 2121: Family companies and trusts in relation to income from personal exertion. This sets out the way in which the Commissioner will deal with such arrangements, the features of such arrangements and some relevant case law.
• IT 2330: Income splitting. This ruling is concerned with partnerships that involve professional services.
• IT 2503: Incorporation of medical and other professional practices deals with companies which have been incorporated to take over the activities of professional practices. Whilst this ruling refers to incorporation of medical and other professional practices, the Commissioner applies similar principles to other cases in which personal services income is derived through an interposed company or trust.
• IT 2639: Income Tax: Personal services income
• TR 94/8 Income Tax: Whether business is carried on in partnership (including 'husband and wife' partnerships). This states that the question is one of fact and it outlines factors that will be taken into account by the Commissioner. In particular, the existence of a partnership is evidenced by the actual conduct of the parties towards one another and towards third parties during the course of carrying on a business.
• TR 2001/7 Income Tax: The meaning of personal services income
• TR 2001/8 Income Tax: What is a personal services business
• TR 2003/6 Income Tax: Attribution of personal services income, and
• TR 2003/10 Income tax: Deductions that relate to personal services income.

### How these issues apply to a change of assessment decision


Whether company, trust or partnership income is derived from the personal exertion of a parent needs to be examined in each case. The primary issue is the extent of the connection between the parent and the income derived and the services rendered by the interposed entity.


### Income other than personal services income


There may be cases involving corporate, trust or partnership arrangements that involve the alienation of income other than personal services income (for example, rental income). In these cases the Registrar will examine the structure of the company, trust or partnership. The Registrar may take into account any relevant taxation ruling or guideline that has been issued by the ATO, but may make a different decision on how the facts are applied to child support.


The Registrar will consider whether the arrangement alienates income that should properly have been included in the parent's ATI (known before 1 July 2008 as the child support income amount) (in respect of companies refer toStein, H.M and Stein, B.A(1986) FLC 91-779, in respect of trusts refer toHarris and Harris(1999) FamCA 1228and alsoAshton, T.M. and Ashton, P.L.A(1986) FLC 91-777, in respect of partnerships refer toAlan Patrick Dwyer Father and Jeanette Anne McGuireMother (1993) FLC 92-420). The Registrar may conclude that a company or trust is the alter ego of the parent, or that a company or trust is a sham for the purposes of the CSA Act or that a partnership is ineffective.


In relation to a company structure, the Registrar can consider the following factors:

• whether the parent is actually running the business
• whether the parent is the 'head and brains' of the company
• whether the parent exercises control of the company and the extent of such control (Richard James Letcher and Secretary, Department of Social Security(1995) AATA 270), and
• any other relevant factor.

In relation to a trust structure, the Registrar can consider the following factors:

• the trust deed
• the settlor, the trustee and the beneficiaries of the trust
• whether the arrangement only gives the appearance of creating legal rights or obligations or whether the arrangement was never intended to create such rights or obligations
• whether any income from the trust has been applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of the parent
• whether the parent has actual control of the assets of the trust and the income, and
• any other relevant factor.

In relation to a partnership, the Registrar can consider the following factors:

• the parties' mutual intention to act as partners is essential in demonstrating the existence of a partnership
• the terms of any written or oral partnership agreement
• the parties' conduct including the extent to which all the parties are involved in the conduct of the business or partnership, their contributions to the capital and asset base of the partnership, etc.
• the amount of distribution to the parent and the partners including any entitlement to a share of the net profits, etc.
• the amount of any salary paid to a parent and the partners and the reasonableness of any salary
• that there is a 'joint' nature to the parties' conduct including the existence of bank accounts, business accounts, liability for business debts, ownership of business assets, etc.
• other indications of a business partnership including separate and distinct business records, a registered business name and features indicating that there is public recognition of the partnership, etc., and
• any other relevant factor.

### Income in the form of undistributed profits


A parent or a third person may retain profits in a company, trust or partnership structure instead of distributing the profits to themselves or others. This may have the effect of reducing the parent's taxable income and could mean that the child support assessment is unfair.


In a change of assessment, the Registrar may consider including some or all of the following in the parent's ATI:

• any undistributed profits from, and retained earnings in, a company
• any increase in the parent's partnership capital accounts and/or current accounts from a share of partnership-earned profits, and
• undistributed trust profits if the parent is a beneficiary of the trust or a trustee.

## Self-employment, business expenses & losses


A parent may be involved in a business as a sole trader in the person's name or under a registered business name. A parent who operates a business as a sole trader is personally liable for all business debts and entitled to all business profits, is required to declare all income from the business in their personal tax return, and is responsible for any tax payable on the business income. A sole trader may or may not pay themselves a wage from the business. Alternatively, they may take drawings whereby goods or money are withdrawn from the business profit for personal purposes.


A business may be able to deduct certain expenses from income for tax purposes and as a result legitimately may have a reduced income or may even run at a loss. These deductible expenses can result in a child support assessment that does not take into account the full financial resources available to the parent. In these cases, assessing child support on the basis of taxable income can result in an unjust and inequitable level of child support.


When considering business expenses and losses in a change of assessment, it will be necessary to examine the full financial position of the business to determine any personal financial resources available to the parent from the business.


### What are business expenses?


Common examples of business expenses include:

• expenses that are partly business and partly private, for example, telephone, home office or motor vehicles
• salary and wages paid to employees
• depreciation of property, plant and equipment
• capital deductions related to primary production, and
• prior year losses and capital losses.

If the tax deductible business expenses provide a personal benefit to the parent, this may make the child support assessment unjust and inequitable. The Registrar will consider whether the parent has a greater financial capacity than is indicated by their taxable income, either as a direct result of the deductions or of having certain personal costs defrayed by being tax deductible.


### Salary & wage earner offsetting business losses


A parent who is a salary or wage earner may operate a business as well as receiving a salary or wage. Expenses relating to the business activity may legitimately be offset against salary or wage income for tax purposes. This can result in a reduced taxable income, which will in turn affect the child support assessment.


However, when considering a change of assessment application, the Registrar may decide that the offsetting of business expenses has led to a taxable income which does not accurately reflect the parent's full capacity to contribute to the support of the child from their income, property and financial resources (Bassingthwaite, CF v Leane, BA(1993) FLC 92-410andHumphries and Humphries(1993) FLC 92-430).


In determining the parent's income and financial resources the Registrar can consider the following:

• Nature of the business activity
• Parent's qualifications for running such a business including the parent's previous business experience and skill
• Parent's financial situation prior to establishing the business
• Income which the business is likely to produce or is producing
• Time at which the business was established
• Asset to which the business expenses relate
• Income available to the parent through salary and wages, and
• Any other relevant matters.

### Expenses partly for business purposes & partly for private purposes


Where an expense is partly business and partly private the expenses must be apportioned for taxation purposes. Parents who are self-employed or who operate a business might claim expenses that may otherwise be considered private as a legitimate income tax deduction. Examples include the fixed-costs component of telephone expenses such as the rental and connection fees, home office expenses or motor vehicle expenses. These deductions are generally not available to parents who derive income solely from salary and wages.


If the Registrar concludes that, as a result of the deductions, the parent has additional income or financial resources that are not taken into account in the child support assessment, a reason to change the assessment may be established.


### Salary & wages or business profits paid to relatives or associated persons


A parent who operates a business may legitimately pay wages or salaries to employees. However, if the employee is a related person, such as the parent's new spouse, de facto partner or a family member and the payments exceed the reasonable value of the work performed, the Registrar may treat the income of that employee as the income of the parent.


In deciding whether to treat part or all of such salary and wage payment as the parent's income, the Registrar will consider the following matters:

• The number of hours worked by the employee
• The duties performed and qualifications of the employee to perform the work
• Whether the rate of remuneration is proportional to the employee's contribution, and
• The usual amount paid for the type of work undertaken in a commercial arrangement at arm's length.

In most cases where an employee receives salary or wages, pay as you go (PAYG) tax withholdings are paid by the business to the ATO on the employee's behalf. In other cases, regular entries may be made in the business's account ledger to reflect the employee's contribution to the business. Where an employee is related to the parent and the business fails to properly account for their contribution and business profits are later attributed to that employee, the Registrar may determine that those profits be treated as income of the parent.


### Depreciation


Depreciation represents the loss or expense attributed to the use of business property or equipment. It is an entry in the business account that is not necessarily an expense that is actually incurred by the business. The aim of depreciation is to spread the cost of a capital asset (for example, motor vehicle, plant and equipment, machinery, building) over the period of its useful life, with a portion of the cost being expensed each financial year.


A claim for depreciation can mean that a parent has financial resources available to them that are not necessarily reflected in their taxable income or the resources of the business. In cases that involve depreciation, the Registrar will determine whether receiving a benefit through claiming depreciation expenses results in a parent having greater financial resources or income than their taxable income would indicate. The Registrar will consider a parent's complete financial situation including the business' overall financial position and the individual circumstances of the case.


Example:If business income is reduced by $10,000 as a result of depreciation and that amount is then used for day-to-day personal expenses the depreciation amount may be considered as an additional resource and added back to the parent's ATI.


Before depreciation expenses can be taken into account as income or a financial resource personally available to the parent, the underlying nature of the depreciation expense must be determined. If the amount claimed as depreciation is used or set aside for replacing equipment (for example, a capital replacement fund) or is actually accounted for as part of ongoing business activities (for example, to repay a loan on a depreciating asset or to otherwise reduce business debt), then this is unlikely to provide the parent with additional financial resources. Similarly, if the business operates at a loss even after accounting for depreciation expenses, these expenses will not be available to the parent as a personal financial resource. On the other hand, if the parent spends the benefit of depreciation on day-to-day living expenses or recreational expenses this will most likely be a reason for changing the assessment.


The Registrar can also consider the asset that is the subject of the depreciation expense, whether the asset is used for both business and private activities and whether the written down value is a reflection of market value.


### Other capital expenses


The principles above apply equally to any business in which there is substantial expenditure on the acquisition or development of plant and equipment. A parent may claim that capital investment is warranted at present as it will produce a higher income and therefore higher child support in the future. In each case the Registrar will consider the parent's complete financial situation and the individual circumstances of the case as well as the extent of the capital investments.


### Prior year losses & capital losses


For taxation purposes some deductions may be claimed during a year even though there has not yet been any direct expense in that year.


Example:Where a taxpayer has a tax loss (more deductions than income), they may be able to deduct that loss from income received in later years.


There are also special rules for capital losses. They may be carried forward indefinitely to be deducted against any future capital gain.


In either case, the result is that a person may have a lower taxable income in a future year and therefore a lower (or higher) assessment of child support.


In these cases the Registrar will determine the parent's capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child. The Registrar may consider the relationship between the loss and the actual expenditure.


Example:Capital losses from 2011 may be carried forward and offset against a capital gain in 2019. As the loss occurred 8 years earlier, the parent may have additional financial resources in 2019. The parent has received a benefit in the later year without incurring the related expenditure. The Registrar may decide that the parent has income and or financial resources that are not reflected in the parent's taxable income for 2019.


However, it is possible that parents may have made arrangements with creditors to repay an outstanding debt caused by the earlier loss. Any repayments will be taken into account in deciding whether there is a reason to change the assessment.


If the debts or losses have been dealt with in a family law property settlement, the Registrar will consider the terms of the settlement in deciding whether there is a reason to change the assessment.


## More complex structures involving businesses


Parents may use a number of different structures to minimise their taxable income. For example, a parent may operate one business as a sole trader but operate associated activities through a company and trust structure. Sometimes the structure used during the parents' relationship is different to the structure used after the relationship has ended. A business may have operated as a family business, as a partnership or as a sole trader during the relationship. After the relationship ends a parent may restructure the business as a company or trust which produces a lower taxable income although the business activity had not changed.


Where there has been an historic pattern of earnings at a particular level and restructuring results in a lower level of taxable income, the Registrar may assess the level of child support with reference to the earlier income.


Parents may use complex business structures which have the effect of minimising their ATI. Where the issues raised by the application for change to an assessment are too complex, the Registrar can refuse to change the assessment (CSA Act section 98E).


## Primary production


Some taxation incentives for the improvement of primary production properties provide deductions by allowing a percentage of the cost or a write-off over a period of time. Examples include the costs of conserving or conveying water, deductions for telephone costs over a 10-year period and outright deductions for measures that prevent land degradation.


Proof of this kind of expenditure alone will not establish a reason to change a child support assessment. However, if the parent has developed a capital structure of primary production that results in the parent being asset rich but income poor, they may have additional financial resources and a greater capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child.


### Farm management deposits


Primary producers can be subject to extreme fluctuations of income that are not usual in ordinary businesses and are outside the control of the farmer. Farmers are able to average their income over a period of 5 years for taxation purposes, to reduce the impact of marginal tax rates. Additionally, Farm Management Deposits (FMDs) provide farmers with a tax effective way to save money during good years to be used during bad years. By depositing an amount in the FMD, a farmer can reduce their taxable income for that year, which would in turn affect the rate of child support payable. The FMD amounts are assessed as taxable income when they are withdrawn in a subsequent year (as long as they remain invested for 12 months).


In deciding whether the FMD provides the primary producer parent with additional income or a financial resource that makes the child support assessment unjust and inequitable, the Registrar will consider the primary producer's surrounding financial situation.


If, for example, the parent makes an FMD in a good year, after a history of low taxable incomes due to poor yields and drought, it would not generally be appropriate to simply add the FMD back into the person's income for child support purposes. If it is likely that the parent will withdraw this deposit over the next few years, the withdrawn amounts will be included in their taxable income at that time, and taken into account in the assessment of child support in the normal course of events. However, in some cases, it may be appropriate to take account of the income that was paid into the FMD before it is withdrawn, through the inclusion of smaller income amounts over a number ofCSPs (1.1.C.150).


Conversely, if a parent who is a primary producer has a history of medium to high incomes and is constantly topping up their FMD without making withdrawals (thus reducing their taxable incomes over a number of years), this may indicate that the scheme is merely being used to lower taxable income artificially. In these cases, increasing the parent's ATI by the full amount of the particular deposit is likely to be the most appropriate action.


## Salary packaging, fringe benefits, Defence Force benefits & allowances


### Salary packaging


Salary packaging is an arrangement whereby an employee receives remuneration from their employer by way of a total package, made up of various benefits plus a component paid as salary. Usually, the employee has some flexibility in the way that their salary is packaged. Depending upon the nature of the salary package, and whether the benefits are reportable fringe benefits, the person's ATI may not be an accurate reflection of their overall remuneration from their employment.


### Fringe benefits


A fringe benefit is a benefit that is provided to an employee or an associate of the employee (such as a family member) as part of the employment arrangement. An employee can be a current, future or former employee. The term benefit is broad and includes any right, privilege, service or facility.


Common examples of fringe benefits provided from employment are:

• provision of a car, house or equipment for private purposes
• a novated lease for purchase of a motor vehicle
• giving somebody ownership of something, for example, items of clothing
• permitting somebody to enjoy a privilege or facility, for example, a discounted loan or discounted airfares, and
• provision of a service, for example, use of skill or labour.

An employer has to pay tax on the taxable value of a fringe benefit. The taxable value of a fringe benefit is usually reduced by the amount of any payment by the recipient or employee towards the fringe benefit. There are specific valuation rules for each category of a fringe benefit (Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986Part III).


Income derived by the provision of a fringe benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act is exempt income and is not taxable income (Income Tax Assessment Act 1936section 23L).


Employers are required to report on an employee's payment summary all fringe benefits with a total taxable value of more than $2,000 a year (Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act section 135P). The total taxable value means the amount that the employer paid or assigned as the value of the benefit. However, the grossed up taxable value (which is the total taxable value as determined by the employer multiplied by a figure pre-determined by the ATO) will appear on the employee's payment summary. The grossed up taxable value is known as the 'reportable fringe benefits' amount.


For child support assessments commencing after 30 June 2000, the reportable fringe benefits total (1.1.R.70) included in an employee's payment summary (being the grossed up taxable value) is included in the parent's ATI and used to calculate the child support assessment.


It is therefore unlikely that a parent's reportable fringe benefits will be a special circumstance that will warrant a further increase in their child support assessment after 1 July 2000.


In some cases a parent may consider applying to change the child support assessment on the basis that their income, property and financial resources are not properly reflected in the child support assessment because such fringe benefits have been included. The fact that reportable fringe benefits have been included in the ATI will not, in itself, be a reason to change the assessment. In order to show a reason to change an assessment a parent must show that other circumstances affect their capacity to provide financial support for the child or that the nature of the fringe benefit received does not provide them with an actual, additional financial resource.


In deciding if the benefit provides the person with an additional financial capacity, the Registrar can consider the individual circumstances of the case including whether the:

• fringe benefit is unusual, or peculiar to the parent's employment
• fringe benefit is one which cannot be 'repackaged' or converted into salary or wages, and
• parent would ordinarily have incurred a similar level of expense for the same kind of 'benefit' provided by the reportable fringe benefit.

A parent may apply for a change of assessment solely because a fringe benefit does not provide him or her with an additional financial capacity. If the parent would have incurred the same kind (or similar kind) of expense but would not have incurred the expense to the extent reflected by the amount of the reportable fringe benefit, and the amount is significant, this may make the assessment unjust and inequitable. The Registrar may reduce the ATI by the difference of the reportable fringe benefit and the estimated expenditure.


The Registrar may also give consideration to Reason 7 (5.2.7) (necessary commitments in supporting oneself) and decide whether it is appropriate to change the child support assessment for a short period to enable the parent to rearrange their salary package or financial affairs. In deciding what is an appropriate period the Registrar will consider the individual circumstances and the parent's commitments in supporting himself or herself.


### Benefits that are not reportable fringe benefits


Some benefits are expressly excluded from the definition of a fringe benefit and do not give rise to any fringe benefit tax liability (Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Actsection 136(1)). Examples include:

• payments of salary or wages
• approved employee share acquisition schemes
• employer contributions to complying superannuation funds, and
• payments for termination of employment (for example, a 'company' car given or sold to an employee on termination).

The Registrar will not gross up the value of a benefit of this type. The Registrar will consider whether the parent could restructure their remuneration package to take the benefit as wages and be in a position to use those monies to meet the child's needs. The final decision will depend on the circumstances of the case and any other reasons under consideration.


### Treatment of Defence Force benefits exempt from fringe benefits reporting


Certain benefits provided by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to its personnel are exempt from the fringe benefits reporting requirements. These benefits are provided to ADF members in recognition of the need for service mobility and the effect this can have on the members' families. The benefits that are excluded from reportable fringe benefit requirements include:

• housing assistance
• reunion travel for members (but not reverse reunion travel)
• reunion travel for children in critical years of schooling
• education assistance for school aged children in critical years of schooling
• special needs assistance provided to families
• overseas living allowance that compensates for cost of living differences
• funeral costs, and
• the entitlement to removal expenses upon the breakdown of a marriage.

The benefits listed above are not reported to the ATO, and are therefore not included in the parent's ATI. Other ADF allowances are reportable. They are those that have clear personal benefit such as subsidised home loans, private use of official cars or free travel which is not part of reunion travel.


The Registrar will take into consideration government policy regarding the exemptions from reportable fringe benefits. The Registrar will not change an assessment solely because one parent is in receipt of ADF allowances or benefits which are not reportable fringe benefits. However, in cases where other reasons or circumstances exist, the Registrar may take into consideration the receipt of ADF benefits and allowances when deciding whether it is fair or just and equitable and otherwise proper to make a particular change to the child support assessment.


### Defence Force allowances - non-taxable


Australian Defence Force personnel serving in war-like zones receive tax-free salary and additional allowances in the nature of travel allowances paid as compensation for the increased cost to personnel of serving in a war-like zone.


Defence Force Reserves also receive tax free allowances for part time service in Australia. Reservists may also serve overseas and receive similar payments to full-time Defence Force personnel serving overseas.


Tax-free payments to Defence Force personnel are not included in a parent's ATI and are therefore not taken into account under the usual formula provisions. This may give rise to a change of assessment application from the other parent. If there are no other circumstances peculiar to the case, the Registrar may increase the parent's ATI by the amount of their tax exempt salary, but will not gross-up the value of that salary. The Registrar will generally not include the value of any additional non-taxable allowances in the parent's ATI.


If the parent applying for a change to the assessment raises other grounds, or the other parent makes a cross-application the Registrar will consider all aspects of the case and consider whether it would be just and equitable and otherwise proper to make a different type of change.


### Defence Force allowances - taxable


Defence Force personnel posted to remote localities in Australia may receive a district allowance paid in recognition of the higher than normal cost of living in adverse circumstances, including the need to use air-conditioners more than other posts. The allowance is taxable and the amount received is greater if the recipient has dependants. This allowance is included in the parent's ATI for the purposes of calculating their child support assessment. As with all income included in ATI, the Registrar will not change an assessment solely because one parent is in receipt of a district allowance.


## Lump sum payments received by a parent


Where a parent receives a substantial amount of money (a lump sum) that would otherwise not form part of their income amount used for child support purposes, and therefore is not included in the assessment of child support, the lump sum may be taken into account in deciding whether the assessment should be changed.


Such payments may arise as a consequence of the parent:

• being retrenched from their employment
• drawing funds from a superannuation fund
• receiving a distribution from a deceased estate
• being compensated for some loss or damage, or
• being successful in a lottery or some other gambling venture.

In each case it will be necessary to decide whether receiving the money makes the amount of child support payable unjust and inequitable.


A relevant factor (but not the sole factor) is whether or not the payment results in one parent being in a better financial position compared to the other parent. However, the fact that there is a discrepancy in the parents' financial positions does not automatically mean that there is a reason to change the assessment (Hampson and Lightfoot(1997) FLC 92-775). It will depend on the circumstances of each case.


Payments received under the National Disability Insurance Scheme as part of a parent's or their child's support package are not included as income for child support purposes. They will also not be taken into account as a financial resource of the parent when establishing special circumstances under this reason. Payments made under this scheme are required to be spent for a specific purpose and do not increase the financial resources available to the parent.


Payments received under the National Redress Scheme or the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme are also not included as income for child support purposes. Although these payments are not required to be spent for a specific purpose, they are intended for the personal use of the recipient, and will not be taken into account as income or a financial resource of the parent when establishing special circumstances under this reason. However, consideration of a payment received by a parent under either scheme as part of their overall circumstances may be relevant to a decision about the parent's earning capacity (5.2.9).


### Superannuation


Where a parent has drawn money as a lump sum from their superannuation fund, the Registrar will consider whether that superannuation entitlement was taken into account in any property settlement between the parents. It may be unjust for a parent to have their child support assessment based on a taxable income which includes a lump sum payment having regard to the earlier distribution of superannuation and property between the parents (David George Carey Husband and Tracey Louise Carey Wife(1994) FLC 92-489).


However, if the parent has a low current income and is making an inadequate contribution to child support the Registrar may still consider any superannuation received by the parent in deciding that parent's capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child. The Registrar will also take into account whether the superannuation has been drawn prior to retirement because of severe financial hardship.


### Reportable superannuation contributions


Under the superannuation guarantee law, most employed parents have superannuation paid by their employers in addition to their wage or salary income. Self-employed parents generally fund their own superannuation contributions.


Parents who are mainly self-employed may be able to claim some superannuation contributions as tax deductions (Income Tax Assessment Act 1997section 290.150). However, superannuation contributions that are claimed as tax deductions are regarded as reportable superannuation contributions (1.1.R.80) and will be included in the parent's ATI.


A self-employed parent funding their own superannuation contributions is, of itself, unlikely to lead to a child support assessment being unfair. However, when considering a parent's overall financial situation, it is reasonable to take into account the amount the parent would have been entitled to receive under the superannuation guarantee if they were an employee.


Example:Under the superannuation guarantee law, employers are required to contribute superannuation on behalf of their employees at the superannuation guarantee rate. A self-employed parent makes superannuation contributions for themselves or others at a higher rate. The Registrar may determine that the contributions over and above the superannuation guarantee rate should be added back to the parent's ATI amount.


Information about the superannuation guarantee rate may be found at theSuper for employers - How much to paypage on theATOwebsite.


### Compensation


Where a lump sum is received because of compensation for a personal injury there may be a reason to change the assessment because the payment compensates the parent for past loss of wages or a reduction of future earning capacity (Harris and Harris(1991) FLC 92-254).


Where the amount of compensation is set by way of private settlement it can be difficult to establish the portion of the compensation which relates to loss of wages or a decrease in future earning capacity. In these cases a decision by the department concerning the period during which the parent is precluded from applying for social security benefits can be of assistance.


The cost of the parent's future needs may be increased and a part of the compensation, if not all, may need to be preserved to meet those costs. The parent's cost of meeting their future needs will need to be ascertained to decide the extent to which the parent's capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child has been increased because of the compensation payment.


### Windfall


Amounts received as a windfall (for example, a distribution from a deceased estate or success in a lottery or other gambling venture) are not assessable as taxable income. They do not form part of the ATI and are not taken into account in a formula assessment (1.1.F.20).


There may be a reason to change an assessment if it is likely that a windfall will increase the parent's capacity to contribute to the financial support of the child.


The decision will depend on the circumstances of the case and any other reasons under consideration.


## Social security payments


Any government pension, allowance or benefit that would normally be included in a parent's ATI in an ordinary formula assessment will be taken into account when considering the parent's income and financial resources under this reason. This includes any pension or benefit that is classified as taxable income, as well as certain tax-free pensions and benefits.


FTBpayments paid for any children in the payee (1.1.P.30) or payer's care (including a child for whom the payer is liable to pay child support) will not be taken into account when considering a parent's income and financial resources.

# 5.2.9 Reason 8B - a parent's earning capacity


## Context


Parents (1.1.P.10) and non-parent carers can apply for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) in special circumstances if the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is unfair because of the earning capacity of one or both parents, including if the assessment is affected by a parent's reduced income.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 98C, section 98E, section 98S, section 117(2)(c)(ib), section 117(4) to (9)


## On this page

• Grounds for departure
• What is a parent's earning capacity?
• When can the Registrar take into account a parent's earning capacity?
• Criterion 1 - not working, working reduced hours, or has changed industry, occupation, or working pattern
• Criterion 2 - decision not justified by the parent's caring responsibilities or state of health
• Criterion 3 - purpose of the parent's decision about working arrangements

## Grounds for departure


There may be a reason for changing the assessment if, in the special circumstances of the case, the assessment of child support (1.1.C.60) results in an unjust and inequitable level of financial support to be provided by the payer (1.1.P.40) for the child because of either parent's earning capacity (CSA Act section 98C(2) and section 117(2)(c)(ib)).


Either parent can apply for a change of assessment using this reason. The Registrar can also initiate a change of assessment using this reason.


The phrase 'special circumstances of the case' is not defined in the CSA Act. The Family Court held that 'it is intended to emphasise that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary' (Gyselman and Gyselman(1992) FLC 92-279).


Although a child support assessment is generally calculated using the parents'ATI(1.1.A.20), the Registrar can look beyond the parent's ATI when considering an application for a change of assessment. Income, earning capacity, property and financial resources which do not necessarily form part of a parent's taxable income (1.1.T.20) can be added to or excluded from a child support assessment (David George Carey Husband and Tracey Louise Carey Wife(1994) FLC 92-489).


## What is a parent's earning capacity?


In respect of the earning capacity of the unemployed or under-employed parent, the Registrar may enquire as to the 'ability of' and 'opportunity for' that person to seek and gain employment(DJM and JLM(1998) FLC 92-816). The Registrar will consider the parent's qualifications, skills, age and employment history.


Example:A parent who has been caring for children and has not been in the paid workforce for many years may have difficulty entering the workforce.


A parent who has been in the same job for 20 years, and is made redundant, may have similar difficulty.


On the other hand, a parent who is qualified in an occupation in high demand would be expected to enjoy considerable flexibility in their choice of employment.


The other relevant consideration is whether or not there are any special, local or other factors that affect a parent's capacity to secure employment. Opportunities for employment vary from place to place and between occupational groups.


In determining the extent of the parent's earning capacity, the Registrar may consider the following (PW Scott Appellant/Husband and CE ScottRespondent/Wife Appeal (1994) FLC 92-457):

• The circumstances in which the parent became unemployed or without income
• The reasons for the unemployment or loss of income
• The nature of the parent's previous employment
• The efforts which they have subsequently made to obtain employment, and
• The property or financial resources that are, or should reasonably be, available to the parent.

The Registrar must weigh up the individual factors of each case in deciding whether a parent who has ceased work, or reduced their hours, has the ability and opportunity to earn a greater amount, and whether that additional earning capacity makes the child support assessment unfair.


## When can the Registrar take into account a parent's earning capacity?


The Registrar must be satisfied that 3 compulsory criteria (see table below) are satisfied before a change to the assessment can be made to take into account a parent's earning capacity, rather than their actual income.

• Criterion 1 - not working, working reduced hours, or has changed industry, occupation, or working pattern
• Criterion 2 - decision not justified by the parent's caring responsibilities or state of health
• Criterion 3 - purpose of the parent's decision about working arrangements

If the parent's circumstances satisfy only one or 2 of the criteria, the Registrar cannot make a decision based on the parent's earning capacity.


The Registrar must also be satisfied it would be possible for the parent to increase their income by changing their work arrangements. That is, work must be available for the parent in their area and the parent must have the necessary qualifications and experience to perform that work.


## Criterion 1 - not working, working reduced hours, or has changed industry, occupation, or working pattern


The Registrar must be satisfied that the parent meets one of the following sub-criteria:

• Doesnot work despite ample opportunity to do so(CSA Act section 117(7B)(a)(i))
• Hasreduced their weekly hours of workbelow the usual full-time standard in the occupation or industry in which they are involved (section 117(7B)(a)(ii)), or
• Haschanged their occupation, industry or working pattern(section 117(7B)(a)(iii)).

It is possible that a parent will meet more than one of these sub-criteria.


Except where the parent does not work, a parent who has not reduced their income cannot be found to have a higher earning capacity.


Example:A parent who refuses a promotion at work, maintaining their income at the same level, will generally not be found to have a higher capacity to earn.


Some reductions in income will not satisfy this criterion.


Example:A reduction from regular overtime to a standard working hours week or loss of bonuses which required additional effort beyond that required of a standard employee, cannot be considered as founding a parent's additional earning capacity.


### Does not work despite ample opportunity


A parent who is not working is one who is not engaged in work for remuneration, or in self-employment for profit.


A person can be said to be not working despite 'ample opportunity' to work if they have had offers of employment and refused them without adequate reason. Alternatively, if the person is not seeking work but there are job vacancies for which they are suitably qualified in their local area, this could also constitute ample opportunity to work.


### Weekly hours of work reduced below the full-time standard for that occupation or industry


This sub-criterion may apply when a parent is still employed and has remained in the same occupation or industry. The relevant factor is that the parent now works less hours than they did previously. The fact that their hours have reduced is not in itself sufficient. The reduction must put those hours below the usual full-time standard for the occupation.


The parent should be able to provide information about the usual full-time standard hours for their particular industry or occupation. Alternatively, the Registrar could obtain information from the person's employer.


### Changed industry, occupation, or working pattern


This sub-criterion may apply when the parent is still employed, but has changed jobs, or rearranged their hours of work, or pattern of work. It is implicit that this change in industry, occupation or working arrangements has resulted in a lower income.


For a parent to change their occupation or industry requires a greater change than simply moving between employers or jobs. There needs be something in the nature of a change in career, or of working in the same type of job but in an entirely different field.


A parent who has changed their working pattern may still be in the same job, or employed in the same occupation or industry. What is relevant is whether the person has changed their hours of work, for example, by choosing not to work nights or weekends or choosing to purchase additional leave, resulting in a lower income.


A parent may change their working arrangements, for example, to being a consultant or sub-contractor rather than an employee. In these situations the Registrar is satisfied that there has been a change in their working pattern.


If the Registrar is satisfied the parent meets this first criterion, they must then consider the second criterion below, relating to if the parent’s decision is justified by their caring responsibilities or state of health.


## Criterion 2 - decision not justified by the parent's caring responsibilities or state of health


The Registrar must be satisfied that the parent's decision not to work, to reduce the number of hours, or to change their working pattern is not justified on the basis of:

• theparent's caring responsibilities(section 117(7B)(b)(i)),or
• theparent's state of health(section 117(7B)(b)(ii)).

This is an objective test. The Registrar must consider whether an ordinary, reasonable person would consider the parent's decision to be justified, rather than whether the parent who made the decision considers that their decision was justified. It is also important to note that if the parent's caring responsibilities or state of health do not adequately justify the parent's decision about their work arrangements, then the Registrar must then consider the third criterion below, relating to the parent's purpose in making that decision.


### Parent's caring responsibilities


The type of caring responsibilities that might justify a parent's decision to change their working hours will only be a personal responsibility to care (1.1.C.10) for another person. Caring responsibilities include responsibilities to persons other than the parent's own children, such as their own parent, a new partner or step-children, elderly relatives or friends.


The Registrar will take into account the following factors when considering whether the parent's decision to change their working arrangements because of their caring responsibilities is justifiable.

• The relationship between the person being cared for and the parent providing care
• Whether the parent has a legal duty to maintain the person for whom they are providing care
• If the parent does not have a legal duty, whether they have a moral duty and the extent of that moral duty
• The degree and type of care provided
• Whether the parent has some capacity for part time or casual work in conjunction with their caring responsibilities
• The availability of alternate care (personal and institutional)
• Whether that alternate care is suitable and/or affordable, and
• The previous and proposed duration of the period of care.

The Registrar will weigh up the evidence about these and any other relevant matters in order to decide whether the parent's caring responsibilities are such that they justify their decision to change their working arrangements.


The parent who is primarily responsible for care of the children for whom child support is payable may not be employed, or may be working part-time in order to accommodate their child care responsibilities. Where this is a longstanding arrangement (for example, one that existed prior to separation, or since the children were born) the parent primarily responsible for care of the children may not have an additional earning capacity, because their ability and opportunity to undertake paid employment is diminished by their child care responsibilities and their absence from the workforce.


A parent who has been in the workforce may cease work, or reduce their work commitments to accommodate their responsibilities to care for a child. The child for whom the parent provides direct care could be the child from a former relationship (for whom child support is payable), or a child of a new relationship. In such cases, the parent (whether they are the payer or payee (1.1.P.30) in the case) may still have an unexercised earning capacity that makes the assessment unfair. The Registrar may consider the following relevant facts over and above those considered in other earning capacity cases.

• The age, health and number of children being cared for
• The practical availability of child-care
• The economic cost of child-care compared with income available to be earned
• The proposed period of the parent's absence from the work force, and
• Whether the parent has appropriately balanced their obligation to support all of their children.

When making a decision about the effect a parent's caring responsibilities have on their earning capacity, the Registrar must have regard to government policies and initiatives designed to encourage parents back into the workforce. If the parent's caring responsibilities do justify their decision about their working arrangements, then the Registrar must not make a decision to base the child support assessment on the parent's earning capacity. However, if the parent's caring responsibilities would not preclude work, or additional work, the Registrar must proceed to consider the third criterion below, namely, the parent's purpose in making the decision about their working arrangements.


### Parent's state of health


As with a parent's caring responsibilities, if a parent has health problems, this may mean that they do not have an earning capacity that makes the assessment 'unjust and inequitable'. If the Registrar is satisfied that the parent's state of health is such that they do not have an unexercised earning capacity that makes the assessment 'unjust and inequitable', it will not be necessary to consider whether the parent's circumstances satisfy the criteria in CSA Act section 117(7B).


The Registrar will take into account any evidence that the parent presents about their state of physical and mental health. It would usually be expected that a parent who claims to have made a decision to change their work arrangements because of their health will have been diagnosed by a qualified medical practitioner; treated for the condition and have made that decision based on medical advice. Therefore, the parent would usually be able to provide medical certificates or reports from their treating doctor, and/or reports from any specialist to whom the parent was referred.


The following factors are relevant in considering whether the parent's decision about their working arrangements is justified on the basis of the parent's state of health.

• The fact that the parent is suffering from a medical condition and the effect that this has upon their capacity to work
• The expected duration of the condition
• Any recommended treatment, and the impact that this has on the parent's capacity to work
• The availability of light duties, if the parent could work in a restricted capacity.

The Registrar will weigh up the evidence about these and any other relevant matters in order to decide whether the parent's state of health is such that it justifies their changed work arrangements. If the parent's state of health does justify their decision about their working arrangements, then the Registrar must not make a decision to base the child support assessment on the parent's earning capacity. However, if the parent's state of health would not preclude work, or additional work, the Registrar must proceed to consider the third criterion below, namely, the parent's purpose in making the decision about their working arrangements.


## Criterion 3 - purpose of the parent's decision about working arrangements


When considering this criterion, the Registrar must be satisfied that the parent has failed to demonstrate that affecting the assessment of child support was not a major purpose of their decision to not work, to reduce hours or change their occupation, industry or working pattern (CSA Act section 117(7B)(c)).


The test is framed as a 'rebuttable presumption'. The starting point is that affecting the child support assessment is presumed to be a major purpose of the parent's decision about their working arrangements. The parent can rebut this presumption by demonstrating, to the Registrar's satisfaction, that affecting the child support assessment was not a major purpose of their decision.


This is a subjective test. The Registrar must consider what the parent's purposes were in making the decision about their working arrangements and whether a major purpose was to affect the child support assessment. It is not necessary that the Registrar is satisfied that the parent's decision was objectively reasonable, but the reasonableness of the decision is a factor for the Registrar to consider in deciding whether the parent has demonstrated that affecting the child support assessment was not a major purpose in their decision.


In considering the reasonableness of the decision, it needs to be kept in mind that this policy on earning capacity is intended to be flexible enough to allow parents to make decisions about their work and life, for example, choosing to pursue a different career. It is not the intention to micro-manage a parent's life on the basis they may have made a better decision about employment than they did in fact make.


The provision refers to 'a major purpose' not 'the major purpose'. This means that the parent can have more than one major purpose in making the decision. A major purpose does not have to be the dominant purpose. It is more than a 'significant purpose'. A suitable test would be whether affecting the child support assessment was one of the most important factors in the parent's mind at the time of making the decision about their working arrangements.


The usual way for a parent to rebut the presumption would be to show that there were other factors that they considered which were the major purpose and that affecting the child support assessment was not a major purpose. The Registrar will ask the parent to explain:

• the factors they took into account in making their decision to reduce their earnings or not to work
• what financial arrangements exist to enable them to support themselves, and
• the consideration they have given to the arrangements to support the children for whom child support is payable after they changed their work arrangements.

The Registrar will also take into account any other relevant information that is already available in the department's records, including:

• statements the parent may have made when advising the Registrar about their change in work arrangements
• statements they may have made to a department officer when discussing collection activities, and
• comments made by the other parent in the course of the change of assessment proceedings.

In particular cases, the parent's employer or former employer may be contacted to establish what reason the parent gave when they notified the employer of their decision.


If the parent cannot demonstrate that affecting the child support assessment was not one of the major purposes in the decision, they will fail to rebut the presumption and it may be appropriate for the Registrar to make a decision to base the assessment on that parent's earning capacity.


It is more likely that a parent will be found to have a higher capacity to earn where they have voluntarily made a change resulting in a reduction in their income. Where a parent has made a change involuntarily, such as being made redundant, they will be unlikely to be found to have a higher capacity to earn where they have made reasonable efforts to resume income earning activities. Documentation which should be available to the Registrar to substantiate claims relating to unemployment includes:

• separation certificates and termination statements
• proof of receipt of a social security pension or benefit that includes mutual obligation requirements, such asJSP, youth allowance as a jobseeker, parenting payment single after the person's youngest child turns 6, or some types of special benefit, or
• copies of job applications and responses.

### Study


A parent might decide to leave their employment (or reduce their hours of employment) in order to undertake a course of study. If the parent cannot demonstrate to the Registrar's satisfaction that affecting the assessment of child support was not a major purpose of their decision to undertake study, it may be appropriate to base the child support assessment on the parent's earning capacity, rather than the parent's reduced income.


The Registrar can consider the following relevant factors:

• The parent's reasons for undertaking the course of study
• The length of the course of study
• Whether the parent took into account their obligation to provide financial support for the children during the period of study
• The needs and situation of the children at the time of the application and during the period of study
• The manner in which the parent will support himself or herself during the period of study
• Whether part-time work or part-time study was available
• The length of time the parent had been planning to undertake the course of study
• The likelihood of securing employment, and of deriving increased income, after the course of study, and
• The qualification that would be awarded on completion of the course of study.

Even if the Registrar is satisfied that affecting the child support assessment was not a major factor in the parent's decision, failure to resume work following the anticipated course of study may leave the parent open to a further consideration of their earning capacity.


### Change of occupation or industry


A parent's decision to change occupation or industry while maintaining full-time employment, resulting in a reduction in income, is not likely to lead to a finding of an increased earning capacity, especially if the parent's previous employment was dangerous or required significant travel and time away from home.

## Making a change of assessment application


A person cannot apply for a change of assessment by phone. The Registrar requires that a change of assessment application be made in writing on the appropriate form (11.2.1) (CSA Act section 98D and section 150A).


The formApplication to change your assessment - special circumstancesis available from Services Australia service centres or theServices Australiawebsite.


In order to make a valid change of assessment application, the applicant must complete and sign the form. It is important that the completed application form discloses which of the 10 reasons the applicant is seeking to have considered, and contains enough information to allow the Registrar to make a determination. An applicant can apply for multiple reasons to be considered.


The applicant should identify the period for which a change is sought. The Registrar has limited powers to make a retrospective change of assessment decision (5.5.2).


The Registrar will not consider an application that includes obscene or otherwise offensive material. Such applications have not been made in the manner specified by the Registrar and will not be accepted (CSA Act section 98D and section 150A). If the Registrar determines the application will not be accepted, a copy of the application and accompanying documents will not be sent to the other party.


Services Australia will contact the applicant to provide them an opportunity to re-submit the application and supporting documents without the offensive material, if they choose to.


## Copy of application to the other parent


When the Registrar receives a change of assessment application, a copy of the application and any documents that accompanied the application will be sent to the other party (CSA Act section 98G) provided that the Registrar has no reason to believe a person's last known address is inaccurate. The Registrar is not required to send a copy of the application or supporting documents to the other party if a decision is made to refuse the application (5.5.1) after making initial contact with the applicant (section 98G(1)) or if the applicant withdraws at this time.


## Right to respond to application


The Registrar must give the other party an opportunity to respond to the application (CSA Act section 98G(2)). The Registrar does this by sending the other party (the respondent) a copy of the application and accompanying documents (section 98G(1)) and informing them in writing that they have an opportunity to respond to the application. The Registrar is not required to give the other party an opportunity to respond to an application if a decision is made to refuse to make a determination (5.5.1) (section 98G(1)) or the applicant has withdrawn their application.


If the respondent provides a response, the Registrar will send a copy of that response and any documents that accompanied it to the applicant (section 98G(3)).


If the respondent's response or supporting documents include obscene or otherwise offensive material, the Registrar will determine that they have not been provided in the manner specified (CSA Act section 150A). The Registrar will not consider the documents and a copy will not be sent to the applicant. Services Australia will contact the respondent and give them an opportunity to re-submit the response and supporting documents, without the offensive material, if they choose to.


If the respondent does not provide a response within a reasonable period of time, the Registrar will consider the application for change of assessment on the basis of the initiating application (and accompanying documents) and any information gathered independently by the Registrar.


## Each party entitled to be heard


All parties must be given an opportunity to be heard by the decision maker, except where a decision is made to refuse to make a determination (5.5.1) under CSA Act section 98E, section 98F or section 98J(2).


Each party to the assessment must be provided with an opportunity to discuss the application with a decision maker before a decision is made.


Unlike a court hearing, a decision maker cannot take evidence under oath, or cross examine a party about the evidence they give during their discussions or in their application.


As a general rule, parties cannot have a representative appear for them during the change of assessment process (CSA Act section 98H(5) and section 98Q(5)). However, there are 2 exceptions. The following persons can apply for a change of assessment in the name of the party or participate in a change of assessment process:

• A person appointed under an administration order to manage the financial affairs of a party, for example, an administrator, public trustee or guardian. In such instances, that person is not considered to be representing the party because they are legally permitted to act as if they are the party.
• A person with an Enduring Power of Attorney that is acting for the party because the party is incapable of attending to, or making decisions concerning, their estate/affairs because of a medical condition (mental or physical).

In limited circumstances, the involvement of a third party may be appropriate to facilitate the change of assessment process. For example, an interpreter may be required or a parent may request an Indigenous Service Officer to help.


## Registrar not obliged to conduct investigations


The Registrar can make a change of assessment decision on the basis of the application, the other party's response and any supporting documents that the parties provided (CSA Act section 98H(1)(a)).


The Registrar can conduct further enquiries, but is not obliged to do so (section 98H(1)(b)). If the Registrar requires further information from a party, or from third parties, a notice requiring a person to provide that information (11.2.3) can be issued (CSA Act section 161).


The Registrar will request that each party provide documents in support of their application or response. The Registrar will examine and weigh the evidence presented by the parties, which includes their written and oral statements, as well as the supporting documents. The Registrar may request that the applicant or respondent provide further information or documents before making a decision on the application.


The Registrar will require a person to provide evidence in support of a claim that they cannot work, or have a reduced capacity to work, because of a medical condition. The usual acceptable form of medical evidence is by way of a written report or medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner. The evidence provided needs to establish that the person is suffering from a medical condition that will affect the person's ability to work. It should state the manner and the period for which that condition will affect the person's capacity to work. The Registrar may also require medical evidence of a child's special needs or of the medical condition of a person for whom the applicant provides care, or has a duty to maintain (5.2.10).


## Procedural fairness


The Registrar must manage the change of assessment process in a way that is procedurally fair. The Registrar must ensure that a person is aware of any adverse information and that they have an opportunity to be heard and make submissions in support of their case. In addition to providing each party with a copy of the other party's response or application and supporting documents, the Registrar will also advise each party of any additional information that is intended to be taken into account in a way that is adverse to them, and invite them to comment upon that information. This would include information provided by the other party during conversations with the decision maker, or by a third party.


## Agreements and change of assessment


Parties can make a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement (6.1) while the Registrar is considering a change of assessment application (CSA Act section 98T). The Registrar must accept:

• a binding child support agreement, or
• a limited child support agreement if the Registrar is satisfied it is just and equitable (5.3) to do so (CSA Act section 98U(2)).

If an agreement is accepted while the Registrar is considering a change of assessment application, the assessment will be based on the agreement rather than on a change of assessment decision. The change of assessment process may continue for the purpose of varying a provisional notional assessment (1.1.P.140) (6.3.2) and therefore the notional assessment (1.1.N.20) amount. The notional assessment is used to determine the receiving parent's entitlement toFTB(CSA Act section 146D(3)).


Where parents already have an agreement in place, and a new provisional notional assessment has been issued, a parent may request a change of assessment to vary this provisional notional assessment (CSA Act section 146C). A change of assessment decision will relate only to that provisional notional assessment.


If the agreement ends and the assessment reverts to the administrative formula or is based on a new agreement, any change of assessment decision affecting the previous notional assessment will not affect the assessment. Parents can apply to change their assessment or to vary the provisional notional assessment (6.3.2) that is issued under the new agreement by applying for a new change of assessment decision if they still require a change due to the special circumstances in the case.


## Registrar must give written notice of the decision


The Registrar must give the parties written reasons for the decision to change an assessment, including the reasons for establishing that special circumstances existed in the case (CSA Act section 98S(4)). This provides the parties with a clear understanding of the relevant considerations and decision making process. The Registrar will also document the reasons for the type and duration of the decision in the notice of decision. If the Registrar fails to give written reasons to either party this does not affect the validity of the decision (section 98S(5)).


The Registrar must also amend the administrative assessment to give effect to the change of assessment decision and give the parties a written notice of the assessment (CSA Act section 75 and section 76). The assessment notice must include, or be accompanied by, information about the parties' right to object to the Registrar's decision (10.2.2), and to apply forARTreview if they are aggrieved by the Registrar's decision on the objection (section 76(3)).


If the Registrar refuses to make a change to the assessment (5.5.1), the parties must be provided with written reasons for that decision.

# 5.5.2 A decision to change an assessment - types of decisions


## Context


CSA Act lists the types of decisions the Registrar can make when changing an assessment.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, section 60, section 74, section 75, section 98C, section 98S, section 112, section 117, section 119, section 151B, section 151C, section 151D


## On this page

• The types of decisions that can be made
• Contrary decisions
• How long should a decision apply?
• Limiting administrative options
• Decisions that are income amount orders
• Where a child turns 18
• Can the Registrar change a child support assessment affected by a child support agreement or a court order?

## The types of decisions that can be made

• vary the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (1.1.C.60) (section 98S(1)(a)),
• vary the cost percentage (1.1.C.200) for a child (section 98S(1)(b)),
• vary the parent's (1.1.P.10) child support income (3.1) (1.1.C.120) (section 98S(1)(c)),
• vary the parents' combined child support income (1.1.C.190) (section 98S(1)(d)),
• direct that the 'cap' on costs of children (2.3.1.10) in the costs of children table does not apply (section 98S(1)(e)(i) and (ii)),
• vary a parent's child support percentage (1.1.C.140) (section 98S(1)(f),
• vary a parent'sATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20) (section 98S(1)(g),
• vary a parent's relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) amount or multi-case allowance (1.1.M.30) (section 98S(1)(h)),
• vary a parent's self-support amount (1.1.S.20) (section 98S(1)(i)),
• vary theCOTC(2.3.1) (section 98S(1)(j)).

If satisfied that a change should be made, the Registrar must make a decision that changes the assessment to better account for the special circumstances of the case. The Registrar can then take into account any relevant factor to decide the appropriate level of child support (section 117(9)).


There are some types of change of assessment(1.1.C.50) decisions that the Registrar cannot make. This includes a decision to vary an assessment to an amount lower than theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support (2.3.4) for a particularCSP(1.1.C.150) unless the payer (1.1.P.40) has at least regular care (1.1.R.50) of at least one of the children in that child support case (4.1.1) (1.1.C.80) (section 98SA). Refer to5.2.1for further information.


## Contrary decisions


The Registrar's decision is not limited to reasons claimed in the application and may be different to the change requested (section 98S(2)). The Registrar can make a decision that has the opposite effect to the change requested. This is referred to as a contrary decision.


The legislation does not define the circumstances in which the Registrar would consider making a contrary decision. However, the Registrar can only do so when satisfied that at least one of the 10 change of assessment reasons exist, and where a change would be just and equitable and otherwise proper.


If the Registrar believes that a contrary decision should be made, the applicant and respondent will be given an opportunity to comment upon the information that may lead to a contrary decision.


Example:Anna applies for an increase to the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) payable by Karl, because of the costs associated with the special needs of the child Holly. The Registrar finds that Anna has some extra costs because of Holly's special needs; however, the Registrar also finds that Karl's income has recently reduced and the assessment is now unfair because of Karl's income. After discussing the circumstances with both parties, the Registrar decides to increase the assessed COTC (1.1.C.210), but reduce Karl's ATI. This has the effect of reducing the child support assessment.


Example:Oscar is retrenched from a long-term position. After several months, Oscar has some part-time work and also receives an income support payment. Oscar lodges an estimate of income for the remainder of the financial year, which is an annualised amount of $15,000. The Registrar reduces Oscar's assessment from the date of Oscar's estimate. Oscar owes $2,000 in arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support. Oscar applies for a reduction to the child support assessment for the period between the date of retrenchment and the date the estimate took effect.


In addition to Oscar's part time income of $100 per week, Oscar has $85,000 invested in a term deposit, and has recently paid off the mortgage on the home which was purchased after separation. Henrique has sole care of their 3 children Esther, July and Fergus. Henrique is unemployed and lives in public housing. The Registrar finds that although Oscar's income has reduced, Oscar has significant financial resources that are not included in Oscar's ATI, and that Oscar's ATI does not therefore accurately represent Oscar's capacity to meet the costs of Esther, July and Fergus. After discussing the circumstances with both parties, the Registrar decides not to reduce the past assessment (and therefore Oscar's arrears), and instead increases the child support assessment for the next 12 months.


## How long should a decision apply?


The reasons for a change of assessment may help to determine the duration of a decision.


The Registrar will make a decision that produces an appropriate change to the assessment and, if possible, allow for future changes in circumstances to be assessed without the need for a further application to change the assessment. If it is likely that future events may affect the assessment unpredictably, it may be best to make a decision for a shorter period.


To provide as much certainty and consistency for the parties as possible, the Registrar will make decisions which cover the longest period possible, having regard to the circumstances of the case. A Registrar decision may cover more than one CSP and the decision may change from one period to another to account for differing circumstances in each period.


## Limiting administrative options


Some change of assessment decisions can limit the administrative options available to the parties if their circumstances change. Setting the ATI of a party, for example, will prevent that person from using the estimate provisions (3.4). The Registrar will try to make a decision that makes an appropriate change to the assessment and has sufficient flexibility to respond to later changes in circumstances.


The Registrar will take into account:

• whether the formula assessment (1.1.F.20) will be an accurate reflection of the parties' circumstances in the future
• whether the current circumstances are likely to continue and, if so, for how long
• the possibility of future events that may be affected by the decision
• the need to provide some certainty and consistency for parties
• the type of decision being made.

## Decisions that are income amount orders


A decision to change the formula assessment may be an 'income amount order' (1.1.I.10) in relation to one or both parents (section 5). A parent cannot elect to have their child support assessment based on their estimated income during a period in which an income amount order is in force in relation to the parent (section 60(6)).


## Where a child turns 18


If the child will turn 18 in the final year of secondary education, the payee (1.1.P.30) can apply to the Registrar to extend the assessment to the end of that school year (2.5.3) (section 151B, section 151C and section 151D).


When a change of assessment decision is made, the Registrar will consider if the provisions of section 151B and section 151C are relevant. If so, the Registrar will express the decision to have effect until a terminating event occurs in relation to the child rather than the day before the child's 18th birthday. The change of assessment decision will then continue to apply to the child support assessment after the child's 18th birthday, if the assessment is extended until the end of the school year.


## Can the Registrar change a child support assessment affected by a child support agreement or a court order?


The Registrar can make a change of assessment decision for any case where there is a child support assessment in force on the day the change of assessment application is made. However, the Registrar cannot vary the terms of a court order or child support agreement in any circumstances. If the Registrar's change of assessment decision conflicts with the terms of a court order or child support agreement, the conflicting provisions of the Registrar's decision will have no effect.


When a court makes an order that affects a child support assessment the Registrar must:

• amend the child support assessment to give effect to the order (section 119(1)), and
• continue to give effect to the order in any subsequent child support assessment (section 119(2)).

When accepting a child support agreement the Registrar must:

• amend the existing child support assessment to give effect to the child support agreement (section 94(1)), or
• make a new child support assessment to give effect to the child support agreement if there is no existing child support assessment (section 93(1)), and
• continue to give effect to the agreement in any subsequent child support assessments (section 95).

If a court order or child support agreement affects a child support assessment, the Registrar can change that assessment by varying any component of the formula that is not set by the agreement or order.


Example:Nick and Annette have a child support agreement that varies Nick's ATI. Nick applies for a change of assessment because Annette has financial resources not reflected in Annette's ATI. The Registrar makes a change of assessment decision that varies Annette's ATI.


Example:Malcolm and Rachel have a court order that sets Rachel's annual rate of child support. The Registrar cannot make a decision that changes the annual rate of Malcolm and Rachel's child support assessment.

# 5.4 Would a change be otherwise proper?


## Context


The Registrar must consider whether it is 'otherwise proper' when considering an application for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) (CSA Act section 117(5)) as the impact of the decision on government expenditure (for income-tested pension, allowance or benefit (1.1.I.35)) has to be considered.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 117(5)


## Matters to consider


In deciding if a decision to change an assessment would be otherwise proper, the Registrar must consider:

• the nature of the duty of a parent (1.1.P.10) to maintain a child and, in particular, the fact that it is the parents of a child who have the primary duty to maintain the child, and
• the effect that any proposed change would have on the child or payee's (1.1.P.30) entitlement to an income-tested pension, allowance or benefit.

A payee who receives more than the base rate ofFTBPart A can receive a certain amount (a threshold amount) of child support (1.1.C.60) from the payer (1.1.P.40) before this affects their rate of payment. Increasing the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support will usually reduce government payment of FTB. Reducing the assessment will usually increase government payment of FTB, and the Registrar must consider whether this would be appropriate (or 'otherwise proper') in the particular case.


Even if parents agree about the rate of child support that should be paid, a change to an assessment may not be 'otherwise proper'.


If there are administrative remedies (for example, estimates of income, non-agency payments) available to the parents it may not be 'otherwise proper' to change an assessment.


Example:Rajesh has made payments to Elvina. Rajesh later applies for a change to the assessment based on those payments. Rajesh has not applied to have those amounts credited as non-agency payments.


If the amounts were credited as non-agency payments, Elvina is shown as having received those amounts and any amount of FTB Part A at more than base rate would be reduced accordingly. However, if the Registrar reduces the assessment by the amount of the payments, Elvina is not shown as having received the amounts and may receive a higher payment of FTB. The overall contribution that Elvina makes to the support of the children would be the same, but in the latter case, Elvina would receive more FTB. The decision to change the assessment is not 'otherwise proper'.


The Registrar must not only consider the amount of the change to the assessment but also the duration of any decision in working out if it is 'otherwise proper'. It may be appropriate to make a short-term decision so the parents can consider a child support agreement or make other arrangements to re-organise their financial circumstances. It may not be 'otherwise proper' to maintain a change to an assessment for an extended period.

# 5.5.1 A decision to refuse to change an assessment


## Context


In some circumstances, the Registrar has no power to make a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision. The Registrar can decide that an assessment should not be changed even though a change of assessment has been initiated.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 98A, section 98B, section 98E, section 98F, section 98J, section 98JA, section 98L, section 98R, section 98RA, section 98S, section 98SA, section 112


## On this page

• No power to make a change of assessment decision
• Power to refuse to change an assessment
• The Registrar must give written notice of the decision

## No power to make a change of assessment decision


The Registrar cannot make a change of assessment decision varying an assessment:

• for any day that is more than 18 months before the day upon which a person lodged his or her application for a change of assessment (CSA Act section 98S(3B)(a)) unless a court has granted leave to make a change for an earlier period under section 112 (10.4.2) (a court may not grant leave to depart from the assessment for any day that is more than 7 years before the lodgement date of the departure application)
• for any day that is more than 18 months before the day upon which the Registrar notified the payer (1.1.P.40) and payee (1.1.P.30) of its proposal to change the assessment in a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (CSA Act section 98S(3B)(b)) unless a court has granted leave to make a change for an earlier period under section 112 (10.4.2) (a court may not grant leave to depart from the assessment for any day that is more than 7 years before the lodgement date of the departure application)
• for any day outside the period for which a court has granted leave for the Registrar to make a determination (and which is more than 18 months before the date upon which the application for change of assessment was lodged, or the Registrar notified the payer and payee of its proposal to change the assessment in a Registrar-initiated change of assessment) (CSA Act section 98S(3C))
• to an amount lower than theMAR(2.3.4) (1.1.M.20) of child support (1.1.C.60) for a particularCSP(1.1.C.150) unless the payer has at least regular care (1.1.R.50) of at least one of the children in that child support case (1.1.C.80) (4.1.1) (CSA Act section 98SA), or
• if there is no child support assessment (1.1.C.70) in force in relation to a child on the day the application for a change of assessment is made to the Registrar (CSA Act section 98B). However, in certain circumstances, a court can make an order under CSA Act section 118 to vary a child support assessment, despite the assessment having ended (5.1).

If a person seeks a change to the assessment for a period that is wholly more than 18 months (or such time as granted by a court) before the lodgement date of the application, the Registrar must not make a decision to depart from the assessment (CSA Act section 98S). As the application cannot result in a change to the assessment, the Registrar will not exchange the application or other accompanying documents with the other party or otherwise involve the other party prior to the decision.


If the application seeks to depart from the assessment for a period, and part of that period is more than 18 months (or such time as granted by a court) before the lodgement date of the application, the Registrar will consider the application only as it relates to the period that is less than 18 months before the lodgement date. As above, the Registrar will not make a decision that affects the assessment for any of the days more than 18 months before the lodgement date unless leave is granted by a court to do so.


Example:Charlie and Nicole have one child, Clive. Charlie seeks a change to the assessment on the basis that Nicole has a greater capacity to pay child support for Clive than that indicated by theirATI(1.1.A.20). Charlie asks that the assessment be changed for the last 2 years. Charlie has not sought leave of the court to allow the Registrar to make a decision for any day more than 18 months prior to the lodgement date of the application. The Registrar considers the application and agrees that Nicole has a greater capacity to pay and makes a decision to vary the assessment by setting Nicole's ATI for the last 18 months, the 6 months prior to that period remain unchanged.


## Power to refuse to change an assessment


The Registrar can refuse to change an assessment in the following situations.

• A parent's (1.1.P.10) financial circumstances, or the issues associated with the case, are too complex to be decided by the Registrar (CSA Act section 98E). Note that if the Registrar determines that issues relating to any of the 10 change of assessment grounds are too complex to be decided, the Registrar must determine that the whole change of assessment application is too complex.
• There are no grounds for departing from the assessment under any of the 10 change of assessment reasons (CSA Act section 98F(a)).
• A change of assessment reason exists, but it would not be just and equitable (5.3) or otherwise proper (5.4) to make a decision to change the assessment (CSA Act section 98F(b)).
• A person makes a new change of assessment application after the Registrar has refused a prior change of assessment application lodged by that person and the Registrar is satisfied that the later application does not include any new issues (CSA Act section 98J(2)).
• The issues involved in a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (5.6.2)are too complex to be decided by the Registrar (CSA Act section 98R).
• The requirements to change an assessment in a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (5.6.2) are not satisfied (CSA Act section 98L(1)).

## The Registrar must give written notice of the decision


The Registrar must notify both the payer and payee when an application to change the assessment is refused (CSA Act section 98JA(1)), or the Registrar decides not to proceed to make a change in a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (5.6.2) (CSA Act section 98RA(1)).


The Registrar's notice must include information about the parent's right to object to the Registrar's decision (10.2). The notice must also advise that if a party is aggrieved by the objection (1.1.O.10) decision (no matter who lodged the objection), the party may apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of the objection decision (CSA Act section 98JA(2)(b) and section 98RA(2)(b), see10.3for information about applications to the ART).

# 5.3 Would a change be just and equitable?


## Context


The Registrar must be satisfied that it would be just and equitable as regards the child, the parents (1.1.P.10) and any non-parent carer before a decision to change the assessment is made. The Registrar will consider whether it is just and equitable to make a particular decision after a reason for a change to the assessment has been established.


The legislation uses the terms 'just and equitable' and 'unjust and inequitable'. The terms 'fair' and 'unfair' are also frequently used when discussing these concepts.

• Would a decision be ‘unjust and inequitable’ and ‘unfair’?

## Factors to consider under 'just and equitable'


Where parents have agreed on a particular child support (1.1.C.60) liability, the Registrar is likely to be satisfied that a change to the assessment which reflects this agreement will be just and equitable. However, the Registrar must still decide whether the proposed change is 'otherwise proper'.


In deciding whether a decision is fair, the Registrar will consider the amount and duration of any proposed change and the factors listed in CSA Act section 117(4) which are relevant to a particular case. The Registrar may give more weight to some factors than to others depending on the particular circumstances of the case. The factors include:

• the nature of the duty of a parent to maintain a child
• the proper needs of the child
• the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the child and of each parent
• the commitments of each parent to support himself or herself, and any other child or person that they have a duty to maintain
• the direct and indirect costs incurred by the carer entitled to child support in providing care for the child
• any hardship that would be caused to the child, the parents or carers, or any other child or person that the liable parent (1.1.L.30) has a duty to support, by the making of, or the refusal to make, a determination, and
• any other relevant matters.

### The duty of a parent to maintain a child & the proper needs of the child


In deciding whether it is appropriate to change an assessment the Registrar must consider the parent's duty to support their child.


The duty to support a child applies to all the children of a parent equally (CSA Act paragraph 117(4)(e)). All the children of a parent have equal priority and the CSA Act does not discriminate between the children of different relationships.


The Registrar must consider the proper needs of the child and must have regard to 'the manner in which the child is being, and in which the parents expected the child to be, cared for, educated or trained and any special needs of the child' (CSA Act section 117(6)). Not only are the basic costs of maintaining a child considered, the individual issues of the child are also taken into account.


Not all of the reasons for a change to an assessment are based on the needs of the child. However, in deciding whether a change is fair, the Registrar must consider the proper needs of the child in all cases even if the reason stated in the application is not based on the needs of the child.


### Income, earning capacity, property & financial resources of the parents & the child


A formula assessment of child support is based on theATI(3.1.1) (1.1.A.20) of the parents. A much wider examination of the financial resources of the individual is made when the Registrar considers whether to change an assessment. The income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of both parents and the child are taken into account when the Registrar considers if it would be fair to change the assessment. This includes any assets owned by or under the control of, or held on behalf of, either parent or the child, even where they do not produce income. See Reason 8 (5.2.8), (5.2.9) for more information. This means that, while the individual is entitled to arrange their financial affairs in any legal way, their obligation to pay child support or contribute to the care of their child might not be reduced as a result of those arrangements when considering if a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) is fair.


Once the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources have been identified, the Registrar will consider the extent to which they should affect the assessment. When deciding whether a change to an assessment is fair, a parent's actual income in the relevant period is considered, as well as the child support income (1.1.C.120) amount used in making the child support assessment (1.1.C.70). If a parent's income has changed significantly then this may be a factor in deciding whether a change should be made.


While a reduction of income of less than 15% of the ATI would not alone constitute a special circumstance under Reason 8, if a ground to change the assessment has otherwise been established, the parent's reduced income should be considered as part of the just and equitable considerations and will be relevant in making the determination.


If the carer is not a parent of the child for whom child support is payable, that carer has no legal duty to support the child. The Registrar will therefore not take into account a non-parent carer's income, earning capacity, property or financial resources when considering whether a change to the assessment is fair.


### Income that is not considered


In deciding whether a change to the assessment would be fair, the Registrar is required to disregard some payments.


### Income tested pension, allowance or benefit (1.1.I.35)


The Registrar will not take into consideration any entitlement of the child to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit, or any entitlement of the payee (1.1.P.30) to an income tested pension, allowance or benefit except where the payment would form part of the payee's ATI in an ordinary formula assessment (CSA Act sections 117(7) and 117(7A)).


### National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) payments


NDIS payments are not 'taxable income' (1.1.T.20) (Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 section 52-180) and are not part of a person's ATI for general child support purposes. The Registrar may consider payments or financial assistance received by a parent under the NDIS as part of the parent's or their child's support package, in deciding whether a change to the assessment would be fair. Such payments or financial assistance should only be taken into account when determining the net expenses incurred by a parent in relation to their disability, or their child's disability.


### National Redress Scheme & the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme


Payments under the National Redress Scheme and the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme are not included in a parent's ATI for general child support purposes. The Registrar will generally not take into consideration any payments received by a parent under either scheme, in deciding whether a change to the assessment would be fair. However, a payment received by a parent under either scheme as part of their overall circumstances may be relevant to consideration of their earning capacity under Reason 8B (specifically the third criterion, see 'Purpose of the parent's decision about working arrangements' in topic5.2.9for more information).


### Direct & indirect costs of providing care for the child & other considerations


In deciding whether a change to an assessment would be fair, the Registrar must consider the direct and indirect costs incurred by the parents in providing care for the child (CSA Act section 117(4)(f)). In most cases, direct costs can be identified and can be independently confirmed.


Indirect costs in providing care are more difficult to evaluate. The earning capacity of a carer may be restricted by the need to provide care for a child. Issues such as missed overtime, additional hours of potential employment outside school attendance or inability to undertake required travel in a better paid job may be identified.


Once costs have been determined, the Registrar will consider to what extent the costs affect the ability of the parent to support the child.


Example:If a parent's direct and indirect costs are low, they might not be considered to significantly affect the parent and, therefore, not result in a decision to change the assessment.


### Other considerations


The Registrar may also consider other relevant matters apart from those listed in CSA Act subsections 117(4) to 117(8) (CSA Act section 117(9)). These other matters are not set out in the legislation but should be consistent with the objects of the CSA Act (1.2.2.10).


Example:If other court proceedings likely to affect child support have been, or are likely to be, commenced for example, property settlement proceedings, the Registrar may decide that it would not be fair to change the assessment if such proceedings are in progress.


Example:Since 1 July 2008, changes to the Child Support Scheme have enabled parents earning money after separation that they would not have earned, derived or received in the normal course of events, to request that this extra income be excluded from their income for the purposes of the child support assessment. This provision is available to parents up to 3 years after separation.


This post-separation income (3.5) provision does not fall within the change of assessment process and only 30% of the parent's total income can be excluded. If post-separation income (1.1.P.90) has already been excluded from a person's income for child support purposes, this will be relevant when balancing whether it is just and equitable to reduce the income taken into account even further, or to further adjust the child support amount in favour of that parent.


If post-separation income has not already been excluded, the Registrar can take this into account in deciding whether it would be fair to change the assessment. If the Registrar considers it would be fair to reduce a person's income by excluding post-separation income during the change of assessment process, the income must not be reduced by more than 30% (CSA Act section 44).


### Hardship caused by the making or refusing to make a change to the assessment


The Registrar must consider any potential hardship that would be caused to the child and either parent, as well as any resident child of either parent, when deciding if a change to an assessment, or a refusal to make a change to an assessment, would be fair (CSA Act section 117(4)(g)).


The Registrar will consider whether the decision limits the capacity to provide necessities for general living or to meet the proper needs of all parties individually and in the family situation.


If the carer is not a parent of the child for whom child support is payable, that person has no duty to support that child. The Registrar will not collect information about that person's income, earning capacity, property or financial resources, and will not consider whether a change or refusal to change the assessment would cause that person hardship.


## Date of effect


When making a change of assessment decision, the Registrar may not vary the rate of child support payable for a day earlier than 18 months before the date upon which the application was lodged (if the payer (1.1.P.40) or payee applied for the change of assessment) or the date upon which the Registrar notified the payer and payee in writing of its intention to change the assessment (in the case of a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (5.6.2) (CSA Act section 98S(3B)). The exception is where a court has granted leave under CSA Act section 112 (10.4.2) for the Registrar to make a retrospective change to the assessment for the period specified by the court in the order granting leave (CSA Act section 98S(3C) and section 112(6)). However, the Registrar is not obliged to make a change to the assessment for the period the court has granted leave (CSA Act section 112(8)).


Apart from this limitation on backdating a decision, the Registrar has a wide discretion to specify the date of effect of that change. Backdating a decision for any period could result in an overpayment to the payee or arrears payable by the payer. This could cause hardship to that person and may put the ongoing financial support of the child in jeopardy.


When considering whether to backdate a change of assessment decision, the Registrar will consider the circumstances of the parties involved. These include, but are not limited to:

• the payer's capacity to pay any arrears (1.1.A.100) in addition to their ongoing assessment, or
• the payee's capacity to repay any overpaid child support.

The Registrar will also consider the circumstances that led to the application, for example:

• whether the application arose from a parent's misstatement of his or her income, or
• whether the parent unduly delayed making his or her application for a change of assessment.

## Would a decision be ‘unjust and inequitable’ & ‘unfair’?


The Registrar must demonstrate that the administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) results in an unjust and inequitable level of child support to be provided by the liable parent for the child, to establish Reason 4 (5.2.4), Reason 5 (5.2.5) and Reason 8 (5.2.8), (5.2.9).


Once a reason for changing the assessment has been established, the Registrar needs to then consider whether the proposed decision to change the assessment is both 'just and equitable' and 'otherwise proper'.

# 5.5.3 Impact of a terminating event, change in circumstances or court order or agreement


## Context


This page explains what happens to a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision when there is a terminating event (2.6.3), a change in circumstances, or when a court departure order (2.5.5) or child support (1.1.C.60) agreement (6.1) is made.


## Act references


## On this page

• What happens if there is a terminating event after the Registrar makes a change of assessment decision?
• What happens if there is a change of circumstances that affects the annual rate of child support after the Registrar makes a change of assessment decision?
• What happens if a court departure order or child support agreement is made where a change of assessment is in force?

## What happens if there is a terminating event after the Registrar makes a change of assessment decision?


### If the assessment ends because of a terminating event


A child support assessment (1.1.C.70) ends when a terminating event (2.6.3) occurs. This also applies to an assessment subject to a change of assessment decision and means that the change of assessment decision also ends.


If the Registrar later accepts an application for a child support assessment for that case (for example, if a parent (1.1.P.10) reapplies because the child returns to their care (1.1.C.10) after living with a third party who did not apply for child support) the Registrar will make a child support assessment using the usual formula provisions, without regard to the change of assessment decision. Either parent is able to apply for a change of assessment if they believe the child support assessment is unfair and special circumstances apply.


A child support assessment will generally not end if the child moves from the care of one parent to the other (or to a non-parent carer who is a party to the child support assessment). This is because there is one child support assessment for all the children who share the same parents and the change of care will result in an amended assessment to reflect that change in circumstances. This means that a change of assessment decision will continue to apply after the change of care in these cases. In some cases, however, the change of assessment decision will have no effect.


Example:Alban and Shana have a child support assessment for one child Kenrick. To reflect Alban's unusually high medical expenses, a change of assessment decision reduces the amount of child support that Alban pays to Shana by $3,000 per year. Before the end date of the change of assessment decision, Kenrick moves in with Alban, and Shana becomes liable to pay child support to Alban. The change of assessment decision does not end because the assessment has not ended. However, it no longer has any effect because Alban no longer has a liability that can be reduced by $3,000. The change of assessment decision may again have effect if Alban becomes liable to pay child support to Shana once more and the end date of the change of assessment decision has not passed.


### If the assessment continues after a terminating event


A child support assessment will continue if there is a terminating event (2.6.3) for one child, but there are other eligible children of the assessment. Where the child support assessment is in accordance with a change of assessment decision, the Registrar can amend the assessment to give effect to the terminating event for the child.


That same child may once again become an eligible child within the period affected by the change of assessment decision. If the child is once again included in the assessment, the Registrar will add the child, and can amend the assessment by reference to the change of assessment decision. For some types of change of assessment decisions, however, it may be necessary for a parent to make a fresh change of assessment application.


## What happens if there is a change of circumstances that affects the annual rate of child support after the Registrar makes a change of assessment decision?


The Registrar can amend a child support assessment to give effect to a change of circumstances that affects the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support (section 75) (2.5.4). Where the child support assessment is in accordance with a change of assessment decision, the Registrar can often amend that assessment to give effect to a change of circumstances that affects the annual rate of child support.


Example:The Registrar makes a decision to set a parent'sATI(1.1.A.20) at $50,000 per year. That parent then has a child with their new partner. The Registrar can continue to use the ATI figure of $50,000 to calculate child support after adding the new child, to the assessment, as their relevant dependent child (1.1.R.60) (3.1.2).


For other types of change of assessment decisions, however, giving effect to a change of circumstances that affects the annual rate of child support may result in the Registrar no longer giving effect to the change of assessment decision.


Example:Olivia and Natalie have one child Cynthia. Olivia has 100% care of Cynthia. The Registrar makes a change of assessment decision to set Natalie's annual rate to take into account the high costs of enabling Natalie to spend time with Cynthia. There is a change in care and the child is now in Natalie's 100% care. As a result Natalie no longer incurs costs to enable contact with the child. The Registrar amends the assessment to take into account the change in care and ceases to apply the change of assessment decision.


Example:George and Rebecca have one child Ellie, and each have 50% care of Ellie. George is assessed under the formula to pay child support to Rebecca. The Registrar makes a change of assessment decision that sets George's annual rate. There is a change in care and now George has 90% care and Rebecca has 10% care of Ellie. Rebecca is no longer an 'eligible carer' (1.1.E.10) under the CSA Act because she has less than 35% care, which means she should not receive child support from George. The Registrar amends the assessment to take into account the change in care and ceases to apply the change of assessment decision.


Example:Asma and Jackson have one child Casey, and each have 50% care of Casey. Asma is assessed under the formula to pay child support to Jackson, due to her higher income. To reflect the high costs of Casey's private education, a change of assessment decision increases the amount of child support that Asma pays to Jackson by $7,000 per year. Asma becomes unemployed and lodges an income estimate (1.1.I.20) of nil. As a result of her reduction in income, Asma is now assessed under the formula to receive child support from Jackson.


The change of assessment decision does not end because the child support assessment has not ended. However, it no longer has any effect because Asma does not have a child support liability that can be increased by $7,000. To take this into account, the Registrar amends the assessment by ceasing to apply the change of assessment decision. In the future, if Asma becomes liable to pay child support to Jackson once more and the end date of the change of assessment decision has not passed, the Registrar can amend the assessment to again reflect the change of assessment decision.


In other cases it may be necessary for a parent to make a fresh change of assessment application to take the change of circumstances into account.


Example:Dinesh and Sasha have 2 children Zita and Drea. The Registrar makes a decision to set Sasha's ATI at $72,000 per year for the period 1 January 2020 to 30 December 2021. Sasha advises the Registrar on 1 March 2021 that they are now unemployed and their income has reduced. Sasha must make a new change of assessment application to take into account the change in income.


### Objection rights


The parents and any non-parent carers are entitled to object to the particulars of the amended assessment, or to the Registrar's decision to refuse to amend an assessment. The Registrar will advise both parents in writing of the decision and their right to object (10.2.2).


## What happens if a court departure order or child support agreement is made where a change of assessment is in force?


Where a court departure order or child support agreement is made when a change of assessment decision by the Registrar (departure determination) is in force, the departure determination is ended and will not be reinstated when the court departure order or child support agreement ends. It would be open to either party to apply for a new change of assessment decision after the court departure order or child support agreement ends.

# 5.6.2 Registrar-initiated change of assessment


## Context


The Registrar can initiate a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) without an application from a payer (1.1.P.40) or payee (1.1.P.30) if satisfied that the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is unfair because of a parent's (1.1.P.10) income, earning capacity, property or financial resources.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 75, section 76, Part 6A Division 3, section 112, section 150A, Part 6A

• Joint election to stop the proceedings
• Each party entitled to be heard
• Registrar not obliged to conduct investigations
• Procedural fairness
• Making a child support agreement during a Registrar-initiated change of assessment
• Matters too complex
• Registrar must give written notice of the decision

## When can the Registrar initiate a change of assessment?


The Registrar can initiate a change of assessment without an application from the payer or payee if satisfied, in the special circumstances of the case, that the child support assessment is unfair because of a parent's income, property or financial resources (Reason 8A (5.2.8)) or a parent's earning capacity (Reason 8B (5.2.9)) (section 98K and section 98L(1)(a)).


The Registrar cannot initiate a change to an assessment on the basis of any of the other reasons that a payer or payee can use to apply for a change of assessment. The Registrar must also be satisfied it is just and equitable (5.3) and otherwise proper (5.4) to change the assessment (section 98L(1)(b)).


The Registrar can only make a change of assessment decision if there is a child support assessment in force for a child on the day the Registrar makes the determination (section 98K). This means that the Registrar cannot make a change of assessment decision for a past period (under section 98K) if there is no longer a child support assessment in force in relation to a child.


The Registrar must notify the parties of the proposal to change the assessment by sending them asummary of information(section 98M).


## Registrar's summary of information


When a change of assessment is initiated by the Registrar, the parties must be notified in writing (section 98M(1)). The Registrar must also serve a summary of the information the Registrar used to form the view that a change to the assessment should occur (section 98M(2)). The summary will contain sufficient detail to enable the parties to understand how the Registrar arrived at the recommended rate.


## Right to respond


All parties must be given an opportunity to provide information for the Registrar to consider when making a decision to change the assessment (section 98N(2)). Services Australia may send each party the following forms to obtain additional information:

• We are considering changing your Child Support Assessment form.
• Statement of financial details - reviewing your assessment form.

If a party completes the response form, the Registrar will send a copy of that response and any supporting documents to the other party (section 98N(2)).


## Joint election to stop the proceedings


If a payee is not receiving an income-tested pension, benefit or allowance (5.3), the parties can make a joint election to ask the Registrar to discontinue the process (section 98P(1)). Parties can do this by completing the form'Joint election to stop a change to your child support assessment being initiated'or by making the election over the phone. An election is still considered to be jointly made if the payer and payee ring separately and make the election. The Registrar will notify the parties in writing that a decision to change the assessment will not be made because of their joint election (section 98P(3)).


## Each party entitled to be heard


Each party must be provided with an opportunity to be heard by the decision maker making a decision on a Registrar-initiated change of assessment (section 98Q(2)). However, the Registrar can decide to refuse to change the assessment (5.5.1) without providing either party with the opportunity to discuss the Registrar-initiated change of assessment.


As a general rule, parties cannot have a representative appear for them during the change of assessment process (section 98H(5) and section 98Q(5)). However, there are 2 exceptions. The following persons can apply for a change of assessment in the name of the party or participate in a change of assessment process:

• A person appointed under an administration order to manage the financial affairs of a party, for example, an administrator, public trustee or guardian. In such instances, that person is not considered to be representing the party because they are legally permitted to act as if they are the party.
• A person with an 'Enduring Power of Attorney' that is acting for the party because the party is incapable of attending to, or making decisions concerning, their estate/affairs because of a medical condition (mental or physical).

In limited circumstances, the involvement of a third party may be appropriate to facilitate the change of assessment process. For example, an interpreter may be required or a parent may request an Indigenous Service Officer to help.


## Registrar not obliged to conduct investigations


The Registrar can make a change of assessment decision on the basis of the information used to form the view that a change of assessment should be initiated, including any responses and supporting documents provided by the parties (section 98Q(1)(a)). The Registrar can conduct further inquiries, but is not obliged to do so (section 98Q(1)(b)). If the Registrar requires further information from either party, or from third parties, a notice requiring a person to provide that information (11.2.3) can be issued (section 161).


## Procedural fairness


The Registrar must deal with a Registrar-initiated change of assessment in a way that is procedurally fair. A decision maker must ensure that a person is aware of any adverse information and that they have an opportunity to be heard and make submissions in support of their case. In addition to providing each party with a copy of the other party's response and supporting documents, the Registrar will also advise each party of any additional information that is intended to be taken into account in a way that is adverse to them, and invite them to comment upon that information. This would include information provided by the other party during conversations with a decision maker or by a third party.


## Making a child support agreement during a Registrar-initiated change of assessment


Parties can make a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement while the Registrar is considering making a Registrar-initiated change of assessment decision. The Registrar will decide whether the agreement can be accepted, in the same way a child support agreement is made while considering a change of assessment (5.6.1) application from either party (section 98U(1)).


## Matters too complex


The Registrar may refuse to make a change to the assessment if it is determined that a parent's financial circumstances, or the issues associated with the case, are too complex to be decided (section 98R).


## Registrar must give written notice of the decision


The Registrar must give the parties written reasons for the decision to change an assessment, including the reasons for establishing that special circumstances existed in the case (section 98S(4)). The Registrar will also document the reasons for the type and duration of the decision in the notice of decision.


If the Registrar fails to give written reasons to either party, the validity of the decision is not affected (section 98S(5)).


The Registrar must amend the administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) to give effect to the change of assessment decision and give the payer and payee a written notice of the assessment (section 75 and section 76). The assessment notice must include, or be accompanied by, information about the payer and payee's right to object to the Registrar's decision (10.2.2), and to apply forART(1.1.A.40) review if they are aggrieved by the Registrar's decision on the objection (1.1.O.10) (section 76(3)).


If the Registrar refuses to make a change to the assessment (5.5.1), the payer and payee must be provided with written reasons for that decision and information about the payer and payee's right to object to the Registrar's decision, and to apply for ART review if they are aggrieved by the Registrar's decision on the objection (section 98RA).

# 6 Agreements


## Introduction


The CSA Act provides for parties to enter into agreements which have effect under the child support legislation, known as child support (1.1.C.60) agreements. Child support agreements are an option for individuals to make their own arrangements about the amount of child support that is to be paid and how it is to be provided.


The policy outlined in this part relates to child support agreements under the CSA Act and does not relate to purely private arrangements that parties may enter into for the financial support of children.


This part outlines what child support agreements are and the applicable rules for agreements. The part also deals with rules around the administering of the child support agreement provisions by the Registrar.


## In this part


This part contains the following chapters:

• 6.1 Child support agreements
• 6.2 Applying for acceptance of a child support agreement
• 6.3 Effect of a child support agreement once accepted by the Registrar
• 6.4 Changing, terminating or suspending a child support agreement

# 6.1.1 Basics of agreements


## Context


A child support (1.1.C.60) agreement is a written agreement between parents (1.1.P.10) (and/or a non-parent carer) on the amount of child support to be paid, and how it will be paid.


A child support agreement has to meet the requirements of the legislation and has to include matters that can be dealt with in a child support agreement. There are 2 types of child support agreement, binding child support agreements (1.1.B.30) and limited child support agreements (1.1.L.40). Once parents have made a child support agreement, either parent can apply to the Registrar to have it accepted.


This page outlines the general requirements of child support agreements. See6.1.2for further information about binding agreements,6.1.3for limited agreements and6.1.4for information about agreements that are to cover periods both before and after 1 July 2018.

## Children for whom child support agreements can be made


A child support agreement must be in relation to a child for whom an application for assessment can be (or has been) made. If a child support agreement deals with other children the Registrar will disregard those children for the purposes of the assessment (CSA Act section 82).


## People who can be parties to a child support agreement


A child support agreement must be between:

• 2 parents of a child who would be able to properly make an application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support for the child in relation to whom the agreement is made (CSA Act section 83, section 25), or
• one or both parents of a child, and a non-parent carer of the child, who would be able to properly make an application for administrative assessment of child support for the child in relation to whom the agreement is made (CSA Act section 83, section 25, section 25A). If both parents are assessed for child support, then they must both be parties to the agreement.

In determining whether an agreement complies with the legislation, the Registrar may act on the basis of the application for acceptance of the agreement, the documents accompanying the application and the agreement itself. The Registrar is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations into the matter (CSA Act section 91).


## What can be in a child support agreement?


A child support agreement under the CSA Act must contain at least one of the following provisions (CSA Act section 84(1)):

• provisions under which a parent is to pay child support for a child to another person in the form of periodic amounts (1.1.P.80) paid to the other person (CSA Act section 84(1)(a)) (periodic amounts to be paid to the other person)
• provisions varying the rate at which a parent is already liable to pay child support for a child to another person in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other person (CSA Act section 84(1)(b))
• provisions agreeing on any other matter that may be included in an order made by a court under Division 4 of Part 7 (CSA Act section 84(1)(c))
• provisions under which a parent is to provide child support for a child to another person otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts paid to the other person and those amounts are to reduce the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable by the parent under the child support assessment (CSA Act section 84(1)(d)) (non-periodic payment provisions(1.1.N.10))
• provisions that a parent is to provide child support for a child to another person in the form of a lump sum payment (including by way of transfer or settlement of property) and that payment is to be credited against the parent's child support liability under the child support assessment (CSA Act section 84(1)(e)) (lump sum payment provisions(1.1.L.60))
• provisions under which a parent is to provide child support for a child to another person otherwise than in the form of periodic payments that are not non-periodic or lump sum payment provisions (CSA Act section 84(1)(f)) (other payments and benefits)
• provisions under which a parent's liability to pay or provide child support for a child to another person is to end from a specified day (CSA Act section 84(1)(g)) (a provision to end a child support liability).

If the agreement contains provisions of a type not set out above, the Registrar will disregard these provisions in making an assessment (CSA Act section 84(3)).


A single child support agreement can contain different provisions for differentCSPs (1.1.C.150) or different parts of CSPs (CSA Act section 84(2)).


For agreements made from 1 July 2018, the agreement is not a child support agreement if it provides for a party to pay child support to another party who is not an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) of the child (CSA Act section 85(1)).


### Periodic amounts to be paid to the other person


A child support agreement can provide for periodic amounts (regular amounts payable on a regular basis) to be paid to the other parent or non-parent carer.


These may be paid directly to the other parent or non-parent carer, to their bank account, or to a third party acting as the agent of the payee (1.1.P.30), such as a solicitor or trustee.


A periodic amount can be adjusted for the costs of living by either the child support inflation factor (1.1.C.130) or theCPI(2.3.2) or another adjustment factor identified by the child support agreement.


A provision that requires the payer (1.1.P.40) to make payments to a third party (such as a school) on behalf of the payee is not a provision for a periodic amount to be paid to the other person. A provision of this kind may be a non-periodic provision (see example below).


### Non-periodic payment provisions


Where a child support agreement provides for child support to be paid otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts it may state that the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment is to be reduced by a specified amount or percentage (up to 100%), which represents the annual value of the child support payable under the agreement (CSA Act section 84(1)(d) and section 84(6)).


Example:Robin agrees to pay school fees for Elise of $5,000 per year. The fees are payable to Sunny Coast College. Robin's annual rate of child support is to be reduced by $2,500.


If the child support agreement does not specify how the amounts will reduce the child support payable, then they are not amounts under the non-periodic payment provisions in the CSA Act and will not reduce the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment (see 'Other payments and benefits' below).


### Lump sum payment provisions


Where a child support agreement provides for child support to be paid in the form of a lump sum:

• it must be a binding agreement (6.1.2)
• it must state the lump sum payment is to be credited against the amount payable under the administrative assessment
• there must be an administrative assessment in force prior to the application for acceptance being made
• the amount of the lump sum must equal or exceed the current annual rate of the administrative assessment
• the lump sum will be credited at the rate of 100% of the child support payable (unless the agreement specifies a lesser percentage).

Note:The lump sum payment is credited against the payer's liability under CSRC Act section 69A (rather than reducing the annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment). As at 1 July each year, the remaining lump sum credit is indexed in accordance with changes in the CPI (7.5.3).


### Other payments & benefits


A child support agreement may include provision for child support to be provided otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts, but not specify how that payment is to reduce the child support payable (CSA Act sections 84(1)(d) and 84(6)) nor specify that it is a lump sum payment that is to be credited against the child support assessment liability (CSA Act section 84(1)(e)).


An agreement may also include a provision for child support other than in the form of monetary payment, for example, the provision of goods or services.


If a provision in an agreement does not meet the requirements of either a non-periodic payment provision or a lump sum payment provision it may be able to be included in the agreement under this heading (CSA Act 84(1)(f)).


If the agreement does specify the provision of goods, services, other payments or benefits then those arrangements will not have any effect on the child support assessment. The goods, services, payments or benefits conferred under the provision of the agreement will be in addition to any administrative assessment.


The additional goods, services, payments or benefits cannot be enforced or collected by the Registrar.


### A provision to end a child support liability


A child support liability, whether started by child support agreement or formula assessment (1.1.F.20), can be ended by a child support agreement which provides for a liability to end from a specified day. The end date can be express or implied.


When the specified day arrives the Registrar will end the assessment from that day (a 'terminating event' under the CSA Act section 12(4)). A provision to end a child support liability does not prevent either parent from applying for an assessment in the future.


## Other requirements of a child support agreement


The parties can sign the same child support agreement, or each sign separate copies of a child support agreement. Where the parties each sign separate copies, the terms of each copy must be identical.


If a child support agreement is made in the same document and deals with more than one child, the Registrar may treat it as if it contains separate agreements for each of the children (CSA Act section 87(1)).


If a child support agreement provides that child support is to be paid by or to both parents or 2 or more parties to an agreement, such as between parents and a non-parent carer/s, the Registrar has the discretion to treat it as if it contains separate agreements made in relation to the child or children by each of the parties, depending on the circumstances of the case (CSA Act section 87(2)). Whether a decision is made to treat the document as containing 2 separate agreements will depend on the facts of the case and the document being presented to the Registrar.


## Agreements with conditions & pre-requisites


The commencement of a child support agreement may be contingent on finalisation of certain family law matters in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Alternatively, the rate of child support payable under the agreement may be conditional upon those matters being finalised.


Example:A child support agreement contains one of the following provisions:


'Simultaneously with entering into this agreement, the parties intend to enter into a Binding Financial Agreement under the FL Act. In the event that the parties do not enter into the said Binding Financial Agreement then this child support agreement will be of no force and effect whatsoever.'


'Subject to an agreed property settlement in which Dejan is to receive $100,000 equity in the property, the annual rate of child support payable under an administrative assessment will be reduced to nil for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.'


If an agreement contains conditions or pre-requisites, the parties will need to provide evidence to the Registrar to confirm that the condition or pre-requisite has been met. If evidence is not provided, the Registrar may determine that the agreement does not contain a relevant provision for the payment of child support (CSA Act section 84(1)), that the agreement is not 'properly made' and refuse to accept the agreement.


The Registrar may accept an agreement which states the rate of child support payable under the agreement will vary depending on whether a condition or pre-requisite has been met.


Example:A child support agreement contains the following provision:


'Subject to an agreed property settlement in which Melissa is to receive $100,000 equity in the property, the annual rate of child support payable under an administrative assessment will be reduced to nil for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022.


For the period from commencement of this agreement until the date of the final property orders, and/or if the final property orders do not provide Melissa with $100,000 equity in the property, the annual rate of child support payable under this agreement will be $25,000 per annum.'


## Child support agreements & notations


An order for a change to the assessment made by consent made by a court can sometimes contain notations, notes or annotations to draw attention to actions the parties have taken or will take in the future. Notations are not orders and cannot be registered as court ordered variations to an assessment. However, they can form a child support agreement if:

• they are signed by both parties (the usual provisions for limited and binding agreements apply), and
• the wording of the notation expresses an agreement that child support of a kind listed in the CSA Act section 84 is payable to the other person.

A notation that says the parties intend to make a child support agreement is not a child support agreement.


Example:A notation that says 'the parties INTEND to enter into a child support agreement whereby Alen will meet all the costs of schooling for Jaci and Bettina and the annual rate of child support is to be reduced by 100%' is not a child support agreement, even if Alen and Liliana both sign it.


A notation that says 'the parties AGREE that Alen will meet all the costs of schooling for Jaci and Bettina and the annual rate of child support is to be reduced by 100%' can be a child support agreement if Alen and Liliana both sign it.


### Recitals


A child support agreement may contain information in the form of 'recitals'. Recitals are usually statements setting out the facts and background to the making of the agreement and often include a statement indicating the intention of the parties. Recitals are often helpful when interpreting the agreement if there is any ambiguity in the clauses and words used in the operative clauses. While recitals do not form part of the operative clauses of an agreement, the agreement can state that they are to form part of the agreement.


## Apportioning amounts payable under child support agreements


From 1 July 2018, where a child support agreement:

• is made in the same document in relation to 2 or more children, and
• does not explicitly provide the amount payable under the agreement in relation to each of the children and it is not possible to work out the amount payable

the agreement is taken to provide that the total amount payable under the agreement in relation to each child is worked out using the following formula (CSA Act section 86A).

• Total amount payable under the agreement ÷ The number of children to whom the agreement relates

Apportioning under the CSA Act section 86A only applies in relation to any event that causes an agreement to cease to relate to a child, occurring on or after 1 July 2018. An agreement ceases to relate to a child where there is a suspension or termination of the agreement in relation to that child, or where the agreement ceases to be in force because of a terminating event (for example, the child turns 18).


If the agreement ceases to relate to a child, the amount worked out using the formula continues to apply in relation to each of the remaining children under the agreement (CSA Act section 86A(3)).


Example:A child support agreement sets the rate payable for 3 children Xanthia, Max and Damien. The total amount payable for the 3 children is $300 per month. The agreement ceases to relate to Max and $100 per month per child is still payable in relation to Xanthia and Damien. Therefore, the total amount payable for the remaining children is $200 per month.


For agreements made before 1 July 2018, the total amount payable under the agreement is the total amount payable immediately before 1 July 2018. The total number of children the agreement relates to is the number immediately before 1 July 2018. The apportioned amounts for agreements made before 1 July 2018 is preserved.

# 6.1.2 Binding child support agreements


## Context


Binding child support agreements (1.1.B.30) are a type of child support (1.1.C.60) agreement which operate in a similar manner to financial agreements under family law that separating parents (1.1.P.10) might make in relation to property, superannuation and spousal maintenance.


This topic outlines the policy specific to binding child support agreements. The rules outlined here operate in concert with the general requirements of child support agreements (6.1.1). Information about when a binding child support agreement can be terminated is provided at6.4.2.


## Act references

• Alterations to binding child support agreements

## Requirements of binding child support agreements


Each party to a binding child support agreement must have received independent legal advice before entering the agreement. This legal advice must be provided by a legal practitioner who has been admitted by the Supreme Court of a state or territory of Australia and holds a current practicing certificate. Legal advice will not be considered independent in circumstances where:

• one party (as a qualified legal practitioner) has provided legal advice to the other party to the agreement
• one party (as a qualified legal practitioner) has provided legal advice to themselves, or
• the same legal practitioner has provided legal advice to both parties.

In such cases, the Registrar will determine that the agreement is not a binding child support agreement under CSA Act section 80C(2). The parent who asked for the agreement to be accepted may wish to withdraw the application for acceptance and re-apply once independent legal advice has been obtained. Alternatively, the applicant could ask for the agreement to be accepted as a limited agreement. However, the rules for the acceptance of a limited agreement are different and may prevent the acceptance of the agreement. See6.1.3.


A binding child support agreement must:

• be in writing, and signed by both parents or the parent/s and eligible non-parent carer
• include a statement that each party has received independent legal advice as to the effect and advantages and/or disadvantages of the agreement, before it was signed, and
• include anannexure, for each of the parties to the agreement, signed by the person who provided the legal advice, which certifies that the advice was provided (CSA Act section 80C).

There is no requirement for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) to be in place prior to the making or acceptance of a binding child support agreement, except in cases such as binding agreements that create lump sum payment obligations under the CSA Act section 84(1)(e). A child support agreement can only be made between the parents of a child or between the parents and any non-parent carer eligible to be paid child support (CSA Act section 83). Therefore if there is no existing administrative assessment, the Registrar must also be satisfied that the parties to the agreement are parents or eligible non-parent carers before a binding agreement can be accepted. See2.1.3for information about when the Registrar will be satisfied as to parentage or2.1.1for information about eligible carers (1.1.E.10).


A binding child support agreement cannot be varied (CSA Act section 80CA). To change a binding child support agreement, the agreement must be terminated and replaced with a new binding child support agreement. For further information on how a binding child support agreement can be terminated, see6.4.2. For information on when a binding child support agreement is suspended, see6.4.3.


A document that forms a property division order, parenting plan, maintenance agreement or financial agreement under the FL Act, can also be a binding child support agreement for child support purposes if it complies with the necessary requirements in the CSA Act section 80C, section 82, section 83, section 84 and section 85 (CSA Act section 84(5)).


## Alterations to binding child support agreements


Parties must sign identical documents to make a valid child support agreement. Any alterations must be initialled by both parties to show that they were made before the agreement was signed.


If an alteration is not initialled, or is only initialled by one party, and the parties confirm the alteration was made before the agreement was signed, then the parties have signed identical documents and the altered agreement is valid. If an alteration was made after one, or both parties signed the agreement and they want the altered agreement to have effect, any alterations must be initialled by the parties and the agreement signed again for the altered agreement to be valid.


If an alteration is not initialled, or is only initialled by one party and there is a dispute between the parties as to whether the alteration was made before or after an agreement was signed, the Registrar must decide whether they signed an identical document. If both parties signed an identical document before an alteration was made, the Registrar can accept the original agreement without taking account of the alteration. If the alteration was made after the agreement was signed by one party but before it was signed by the other, the parties did not sign the same document and there is no agreement between them.


Alterations to a binding child support agreement can only be made with legal advice, statements and certificates being obtained by both parties before they initial any changes.

# 6.1.3 Limited child support agreements


## Context


Limited child support agreements (1.1.L.40) are a type of agreement that allow parents (1.1.P.10) some flexibility to determine their own child support (1.1.C.60) arrangements. Limited child support agreements do not require the parties to have received legal advice before entering into the agreement.


## Act references


## On this page

• Limited child support agreements
• Alterations to a limited child support agreement

## Limited child support agreements


For a limited child support agreement to be accepted by the Registrar there must be a child support administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) in place at the time an application for acceptance of the limited agreement is received by the Registrar. Also, for the agreement to be accepted, the agreement must be for at least the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support that would otherwise be payable under the administrative assessment, payable by the same parent as under the assessment.


Example:Under an administrative assessment, Andre is required to pay Marcelline $10,000 a year in child support. Andre and Marcelline enter into a limited child support agreement whereby Andre will pay Marcelline $7,500 a year. The agreement cannot be accepted as the amount payable by Andre under the agreement is not at least the amount that is otherwise payable by Andre under the administrative assessment.


Where an agreement includes the provision of an 'in kind' benefit, the Registrar may need to assign a value to that benefit in order to determine whether the amount in the agreement is at least the annual rate of child support that would otherwise be payable under the administrative assessment.


A limited child support agreement must:

• be in writing, and signed by both parents or the parent/s and eligible non-parent carer
• have an administrative assessment in place at the time an application for acceptance of the limited child support agreement is received by the Registrar
• meet the conditions set out below:if the child support agreement commences on the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent under the agreement on the day of the application must be at least the annual rate that would have been otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment on that day (CSA Act section 80E(2))if the child support agreement commences on a day after the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent under the agreement on the day the agreement commences must be at least the annual rate that would have been otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment on that day (CSA Act section 80E(3)). If the agreement commences on a day in the future for which the annual rate is not yet known, the agreement cannot be accepted until the annual rate on that day is knownif child support is payable under the agreement for a period of time before the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the amount payable under the agreement for the whole period must be at least the amount of child support that would be otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment for that whole period (CSA Act section 80E(4)).
• if the child support agreement commences on the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent under the agreement on the day of the application must be at least the annual rate that would have been otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment on that day (CSA Act section 80E(2))
• if the child support agreement commences on a day after the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the annual rate of child support payable by the parent under the agreement on the day the agreement commences must be at least the annual rate that would have been otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment on that day (CSA Act section 80E(3)). If the agreement commences on a day in the future for which the annual rate is not yet known, the agreement cannot be accepted until the annual rate on that day is known
• if child support is payable under the agreement for a period of time before the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement is made to the Registrar, the amount payable under the agreement for the whole period must be at least the amount of child support that would be otherwise payable by that parent under the administrative assessment for that whole period (CSA Act section 80E(4)).

If, when considering the annual rate or amount of child support that would otherwise be payable by the parent under the administrative assessment, there is a decision pending (for example, a change in care or income) that would affect the rate of child support otherwise payable on the day the application is made for acceptance of the agreement, the applicable rate or amount that applies under the CSA Act sections 80E(2), 80E(3) or 80E(4) will be the rate or amount under the amended assessment. The Registrar will therefore finalise the relevant decision before applying the applicable test above (CSA Act sections 80E(2), 80E(3) or 80E(4)).


Example:Babette and Runa have shared care (1.1.C.10) of Silvius and Felix. Runa is assessed to pay Babette $4,000 in child support.


On 20 June 2023, Babette advises the Registrar that as of 31 May 2023 both Silvius and Felix are in their full-time care.


On 30 June 2023, Babette applies for acceptance of a limited agreement in respect of Silvius and Felix, with an annual rate of $5,000 total. The agreement is to take effect from 30 June 2023. The Registrar will finalise the care percentage decision before making a decision on the application for acceptance of the limited agreement, because the care decision will affect the rate of child support payable on the day the application was made for acceptance of the agreement.


A new care determination is made on 5 July 2023 with effect for both parents from 31 May 2023 (as the notification made on 20 June 2023 was within 28 days of the care change). Under the amended assessment, Runa is assessed to pay $9,000 to Babette.


The agreement does not meet the requirement of CSA Act section 80E(2) as the annual rate of child support payable under the agreement ($5,000) is not at least the annual rate of child support payable under the formula assessment (1.1.F.20) that applies on 30 June 2023 ($9,000), the day the application was made for acceptance of the agreement.


Limited agreements cannot usually reverse the paying and receiving roles of the parents, as the annual rate payable by the paying parent under the agreement must be at least the rate payable by that parent under the administrative assessment.


Example:Roxanna and Hartwin have a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) for their children Dotty and Suresh, who live with each parent 50% of the time. Roxanna is assessed to pay Hartwin $2,000 in child support each year, $1,000 for Dotty and $1,000 for Suresh. Roxanna and Hartwin cannot make a limited agreement for Hartwin to pay Roxanna $3,000 per year, as Roxanna would not pay at least the assessed annual rate under the agreement. They can make a binding agreement instead.


However, if each parent has the paying role in relation to one of their children, because of different care arrangements for the children, an agreement made in relation to one of the children may cause the overall roles to reverse after the higher agreement amount is offset against the assessment amount for the other child under the CSA Act section 67A.


Example:Linda and Kiran have a child support assessment for their children Talon and Harper. Talon lives with Linda and Harper lives with Kiran. Linda is assessed to pay Kiran $2,000 per year for Harper and Kiran is assessed to pay Linda $1,000 per year for Talon; the amounts are offset so that Linda pays Kiran $1,000. Talon needs orthodontic work, and Linda and Kiran agree that Kiran will pay $5,000 for one year for Talon. This can be accepted as a limited agreement because it relates only to Talon and Kiran will pay more than the assessed rate for Talon. After offsetting, Kiran now pays Linda $3,000 for the year.


A limited child support agreement cannot be varied (CSA Act section 80F). To change a limited child support agreement, the agreement must be terminated and replaced with a new limited child support agreement. For further information on how a limited child support agreement can be terminated, see6.4.2. For further information on how a limited child support agreement can be suspended, see6.4.3.


A document that forms a property division order, parenting plan, maintenance agreement or financial agreement under the FL Act, can also be a limited child support agreement for child support purposes if it complies with the necessary requirements in the CSA Act (CSA Act section 84(5)).


## Alterations to a limited child support agreement


Parties must sign identical documents to make a valid child support agreement. Any alterations must be initialled by both parties to show that they were made before the agreement was signed.


If an alteration is not initialled, or is only initialled by one party, and the parties confirm the alteration was made before the agreement was signed, then the parties have signed identical documents and the altered agreement is valid. If an alteration was made after one, or both parties signed the agreement and they want the altered agreement to have effect, any alterations must be initialled by the parties and the agreement signed again for the altered agreement to be valid.


If an alteration is not initialled, or is only initialled by one party and there is a dispute between the parties as to whether the alteration was made before or after an agreement was signed, the Registrar must decide whether they signed an identical document. If both parties signed an identical document before an alteration was made, the Registrar can accept the original agreement without taking account of the alteration. If the alteration was made after the agreement was signed by one party but before it was signed by the other, the parties did not sign the same document and there is no agreement between them.

# 6.1.4 Agreements that cover periods before & after 1 July 2008 & transitional agreements


## Background


Significant reforms were made to the CSA Act, including the child support (1.1.C.60) agreement provisions, from 1 July 2008. This page deals with arrangements for agreements submitted for acceptance on or after 1 July 2008 that are intended to cover periods both before and after that date.


This topic also deals with transitional agreements, which relates to agreements that existed prior to 1 July 2008.


## On this page

• Decision on application for acceptance of agreement to cover periods before & after 1 July 2008
• Transitional agreements

## Decision on application for acceptance of agreement to cover periods before & after 1 July 2008


Some child support agreements lodged with the Registrar on or after 1 July 2008 will affect child support assessments (1.1.C.70) for periods prior to 1 July 2008, as well as periods from 1 July 2008. In these circumstances, the child support agreement will be treated as 2 separate child support agreements - one for the period prior to 1 July 2008 and the other for the period from 1 July 2008.


The pre-1 July 2008 legislation will be applied in determining whether to accept the first child support agreement - for the period prior to 1 July 2008. The current legislation, as outlined in this chapter, will be applied in determining whether to accept the second child support agreement - for the period from 1 July 2008.


This may mean that one of the agreements is accepted and the other is not accepted


Act reference:Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2008Schedule 6 item 16


## Transitional agreements


These are child support agreements that were made and accepted by the Registrar prior to 1 July 2008 and continue to have effect from 1 July 2008. These agreements are considered to be binding child support agreements (1.1.B.30). However, some different rules apply to these agreements as compared with binding child support agreements made and accepted by the Registrar after 1 July 2008 discussed above.


Prior to 1 July 2008, the Registrar reviewed all child support agreements that would be in force on that day(Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme - New Formula and Other Measures) Act 2006(the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 73)).


The Registrar considered each agreement to determine whether the agreement contained provisions that would continue after 1 July 2008. Section 11 of theChild Support Reform (New Formula and Other Measures) Regulations 2018specifies which provisions of an agreement would continue to operate after 1 July 2008.


Where the continuity of the agreement provisions are not affected by the changed legislation, then it became a special type of binding child support agreement known as a transitional child support agreement (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 74(1)(b)(i)).


The Registrar will not issue notional assessments (6.3.2) (1.1.N.20) in relation to transitional child support agreements. Where the assessment is determined under a transitional agreement, a parent's (1.1.P.10) entitlement to FTB Part A will be assessed on the basis of the agreed amount of child support pursuant to the transitional agreement.


Where a child support agreement contained provisions that do not operate after 1 July 2008, for example, based on components of the previous child support formula (1.1.C.110) that no longer exist, it was terminated by the Registrar as at 30 June 2008 (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 74(1)(b)(ii)). An administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) based on the child support formula was made for the period after 1 July 2008, where an administrative assessment was in place before the child support agreement was accepted. If no administrative assessment was in place before the child support agreement was accepted then the Registrar's decision to terminate the child support agreement has the effect of a terminating event (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 74(2)).


The Registrar notified the parties in writing of the decision to terminate or make binding each such agreement (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 74(3)). The parties were also advised of their objection (1.1.O.10) and appeal rights (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 items 74(4) to (6)).


A transitional child support agreement can be terminated:

• by the same methods as other binding child support agreements (see6.4.2for further information), or
• by an agreement in writing signed by both parties to the effect that the previous child support agreement is terminated (the Reforms Act Schedule 5 item 75(6)).

# 6.2.2 Making a decision on an application for acceptance of a child support agreement


## Context


The CSA Act sets out how the Registrar makes a decision to accept, or to refuse, a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement or termination agreement. The Registrar can only accept an agreement where certain requirements are met.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 29B, section 91, section 92, section 96, section 98T, section 98U, section 119, Part 6A, Part 7


## On this page

• An agreement or a consent order?
• An agreement during a change of assessment process
• Making a decision to accept or refuse a child support agreement
• Notification of the decision

In deciding whether an agreement is a child support agreement, the Registrar may act on the basis of the application, any documents accompanying the application, and the agreement itself. The Registrar is not required to conduct any inquiries or investigations before making a decision (CSA Act section 91).


## An agreement or a consent order?


Orders for a change to the assessment, which are made by consent under Part 7 of the CSA Act, may be signed by both parents (1.1.P.10) and contain provisions that can be in a child support agreement. A court order, however, is not a child support agreement. A parent does not have to apply to the Registrar for acceptance of a court order. When notified that a court has made a departure order changing the assessment, the Registrar is obliged to amend the child support assessment (1.1.C.70) to give effect to that order (CSA Act section 119).


## An agreement during a change of assessment process


If a parent or non-parent carer has applied for a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) and the parties enter into a child support agreement before the change of assessment decision is made, then the Registrar must decide to accept or refuse the agreement (CSA Act section 98U). See5.6.1for details of how the Registrar will make this decision.


## Making a decision to accept or refuse a child support agreement


If a parent or non-parent carer applies for the Registrar to accept a child support agreement outside the change of assessment process, the way the Registrar will make a decision will depend on whether the application relates to a binding or limited agreement (CSA Act section 92).


The requirements for a binding child support agreement are set out in6.1.2and the requirements for a limited child support agreement are set out in6.1.3.


If the agreement is properly made, the Registrar must accept the agreement (CSA Act section 92(1)).


Note:The Registrar must refuse to accept an agreement where the assessment commenced with an application from an overseas authority (1.1.O.30) of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSA Act section 29B(1)(b)) and that authority does not approve the acceptance of the agreement (CSA Act section 92(5)).


## Notification of the decision


Once the Registrar has decided to accept, or refuse, an agreement the Registrar will notify both parties and advise them of their review rights (CSA Act section 96).

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 6.3.1 Effect of a child support agreement


## Context


The effect of a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement will depend on the provisions it contains, and, for binding agreements, on whether there was an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support in place when the application for acceptance of the agreement was made.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 34B, section 93, section 94, section 95, section 118, section 124, section 125, section 151


## On this page

• Date of effect where child support is not already payable
• Date of effect where child support is already payable
• Effect of certain provisions of a child support agreement
• Effect of suspension on a child support agreement

## Date of effect where child support is not already payable


When the Registrar accepts a child support agreement where child support is not already payable (known as an initiating agreement), the Registrar will assess the rate of child support based on the agreement (CSA Act section 93(2)). In these circumstances, an administrative assessment is not created because an application for administrative assessment has not been made (CSA Act section 31). The child support assessment (1.1.C.70) will start from the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar (CSA Act section 93(1)(g)).


## Date of effect where child support is already payable


When the Registrar accepts a child support agreement where child support is already payable (known as a non-initiating agreement), the existing assessment will be varied in accordance with the terms of the agreement (CSA Act section 34B(2)). If the application for acceptance of the child support agreement was:

• made within 28 days after the agreement was signed, or 90 days if the parent (1.1.P.10) is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSA Act section 34B(3)), the assessment will be varied from the date specified in the agreement provided that date is not before the date the child support liability began (in which case the assessment will be varied from the start date of the child support liability)
• made within 28 days after the agreement was signed (or 90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction) and no date is specified in the agreement, the assessment will be varied from the date the agreement was signed, or
• not made within 28 days after the agreement was signed (or 90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction), the assessment will be varied from the day on which the application for acceptance of the agreement was made to the Registrar.

## Effect of certain provisions of a child support agreement


Once a child support agreement is accepted by the Registrar the provisions have effect as though they were orders made by a court (CSA Act section 95).


If a child support agreement includes:

• a provision for periodic payments by a parent
• a provision varying a provision of that kind, or
• a provision agreeing on any other matter that a court can include in an order for a change to the assessment (see10.4.2for more information (CSA Act section 118))

the provision has the same effect on the child support assessment as a court order made by consent (CSA Act section 95(2)). This means the child support assessment must take into account those provisions of the agreement.


If a child support agreement includes a provision for a parent to provide child support to the other party otherwise than in the form of periodic amounts (1.1.P.80) paid to the other parent (non-periodic payment provisions (1.1.N.10)):

• the provision has effect, for the purposes of making an assessment under CSA Act Part 5, as if it is a consent order (CSA Act section 124), and
• if the agreement is registered in a court with jurisdiction under the FL Act, the court can enforce the provision as if it were an order made under the FL Act (CSA Act section 95(3)).

If a child support agreement includes a provision stating:

• whether a non-periodic amount is to be credited against a parent's child support liability under an assessment, and
• the annual value or specifying a percentage by which the child support payable should be reduced

those statements have effect as if they were statements made by a court that an amount in relation to an order that child support be provided in a form otherwise than in periodic amounts is to reduce the assessment in a specified way. This means that the Registrar must amend the child support assessment to give effect to those crediting provisions (CSA Act section 127).


## Effect of suspension on a child support agreement


For assessments resulting from an initiating agreement, child support is not payable for a child under the agreement if the agreement is suspended (CSA Act section 86). The liability for the child would be nil during the suspension period, as there was no prior assessment of child support before the agreement was accepted. There are rules governing how child support is assessed where an application for assessment is made following an election to end a liability based on an initiating agreement that is suspended (6.4.3).


For assessments resulting from a non-initiating agreement, when the agreement is suspended (CSA Act section 86), the variation to the assessment as made by the agreement no longer has effect. During the suspension, the liability for the child is assessed under the applicable child support formula (1.1.C.110) provisions.


For further information about suspensions, see6.4.3.

# 6.2.1 Application for acceptance of a child support agreement


## Context


Once parties make a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement, either can apply to the Registrar for acceptance of the agreement.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 88, section 89, section 92, section 93


## Description


Either party is entitled to apply to the Registrar for acceptance of a child support agreement or a termination agreement. An application for acceptance of a child support agreement does not need to be made in writing (11.2.1).


When an application for acceptance of a limited child support agreement (6.1.3) is received by the Registrar, there must be an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) in force otherwise the agreement cannot be accepted (section 92(3)). A binding agreement (6.1.2) can be accepted without an administrative assessment being in force because that requirement only applies to a limited child support agreement.


If an administrative assessment is in force due to an application made by an overseas authority (1.1.O.30) of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) on behalf of one of the parties to the agreement, and the overseas authority does not approve the acceptance of the agreement, the Registrar must refuse to accept the agreement (section 92(5)).


## Frequently asked questions


Can a parent (1.1.P.10) apply for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) after the Registrar has accepted an agreement to end an earlier child support assessment?


Yes. The agreement to end an assessment is a terminating event. It does not preclude the making of another child support assessment if either parent or a non-parent carer later makes another application for a child support assessment.

# 6.3 Effect of a child support agreement once accepted by the Registrar


## Context


This chapter deals with the policy relating to actions taken by the Registrar following the acceptance of a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement.


Upon accepting an application for acceptance of a child support agreement, the Registrar must assess the rate of child support payable in accordance with the agreement.


Following the acceptance of an agreement the Registrar must also create a notional assessment (1.1.N.20) (initially a provisional notional assessment (1.1.P.140) which later turns into a notional assessment). The notional assessment reflects the amount of child support that would be payable if the applicable formula applied rather than the agreement.

## Context


This chapter deals with the policy related to varying and terminating child support (1.1.C.60) agreements after they have been accepted.


From 1 July 2018, a child support agreement may be suspended if there is a change in care (1.1.C.10) arrangements that results in the carer entitled to child support under the agreement ceasing to be an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) of the relevant child. The suspending of child support agreements is also explained in this chapter.

# 6.3.2 Notional assessments


## Context


Where a child support (1.1.C.60) agreement has been accepted by the Registrar, the Registrar also calculates the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable as if child support were to be payable under the applicable formula as opposed to the agreement. This is a notional assessment (1.1.N.20).


The notional assessment is used in theMITwhen working out a person’s rate of FTB Part A. The way a notional assessment is applied to the MIT (FA Guide3.1.7) depends on if the case has a private collect (1.1.P.110) arrangement or an agency collect (1.1.A.50) arrangement. More information about how notional assessments is used by the MIT is provided at FA Guide3.1.7.14.


## Act references


CSA ActPart 7A, section 124, section 125, section 146F, section 146B, section 146C, section 44, section 66A, section 146D, section 98B, section 146G, section 5, section 146K, section 146H, section 80, section 146A, section 146E


## On this page

• Background
• Provisional notional assessments
• Notional assessments
• Later provisional notional assessments

## Background


Notional assessments are required for most child support agreements, as well as certain orders made by a court where the annual rate of child support is to be reduced in accordance with an order that child support be provided in a form otherwise than in periodic amounts (1.1.P.80).


## Provisional notional assessments (1.1.P.140)


Once the Registrar has decided to accept a child support agreement, a provisional notional assessment must be made. This provisional notional assessment will be calculated using both parents' (1.1.P.10)ATI(1.1.A.20) and the most recent care (1.1.C.10) details for the children available to the Registrar (CSA Act section 146B(2)).


In making the provisional notional assessment the Registrar must take into account any relevant change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision and also any departure order made by a court (CSA Act section 146B(2)).


The Registrar must serve notice, in writing, of the provisional notional assessment on both parties. The notice will advise the parties they are entitled to seek a variation of the provisional notional assessment (CSA Act section 146B(5)).


### Varying a provisional notional assessment


If a parent feels that a provisional notional assessment does not reflect their circumstances, they may seek a variation of the provisional notional assessment (CSA Act section 146C) within 14 days of receiving the notice by doing one or more of the following:

• Making an application to exclude additional income earned post separation (3.5) (CSA Act section 44 and section 146C(1)(aa)).
• Making an application to reduce the annual notional assessment rate to nil (2.3.4) (CSA Act section 66A and section 146C(1)(ab)).
• Notifying the Registrar of a change to the percentage of care (1.1.P.70) that a party has of the child/ren (CSA Act section 146C(1)(a)).
• Making an application for a change of assessment to the Registrar, where relevant special circumstances exist to depart from the provisional notional assessment (CSA Act section 146D and Part 6A).Note:TheFamilies, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further 2008 Budget and Other Measures) Act 2008amended CSA Act section 146D to provide that where a child support agreement is accepted by the Registrar after a departure application is made under CSA Act section 98B but before the departure application has been determined, the departure application is taken to be an application for a variation of the provisional notional assessment. This provision took effect from 6 January 2009 and applies to agreements accepted on or after 6 January 2009.
• If the applicant is a parent of the relevant child, making an election to estimate (3.4) their ATI (CSA Act section 146G). The parent may make an election if he or she estimates that their ATI for the 12 months from the date of the provisional notional assessment will be at least 15% less than the ATI used in the provisional notional assessment. The ATI used in the provisional notional assessment can be one issued by the ATO or one based on a declaration made by the parent that the Registrar is satisfied is correct.Note:A parent may not elect to use an estimate of income where an income amount order (1.1.I.10) (CSA Act section 5) is in force, other than the relevant child support agreement, in relation to the parent and the particular period of time relevant to the provisional notional assessment (CSA Act section 146G(2)).

At any time before the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, a parent who made an election to estimate may revoke that election and substitute a new election (CSA Act section 146K).


The Registrar may refuse to accept the estimate election if it is likely to be less than the actual amount that would be the parent's ATI for that 12-month period (CSA Act section 146H).


A parent may not object to the Registrar varying, or refusing to vary, a provisional notional assessment. Instead, once the provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment, a parent can object (10.2.2) to the particulars of the notional assessment (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 14A).


### Multiple provisional notional assessments


In some circumstances where both parents have requested a new provisional notional assessment and then sought to vary those assessments, more than one provisional notional assessment can exist at the same time. All variations to all provisional notional assessments must be finalised before a provisional notional assessment can become a notional assessment.


Example:George and Gladys have a limited child support agreement. George requests a new provisional notional assessment and seeks a variation to reflect their new income by applying for a change of assessment.


While the change of assessment application is being considered, Gladys notifies a change in care of the children.


More than 14 days have passed since Gladys received notice of the new provisional notional assessment, so they are unable to seek a variation to this assessment. Gladys therefore requests a new provisional notional assessment, and then seeks a variation.


This second provisional notional assessment is varied to reflect the change in care. However, it is unable to be converted to a notional assessment while the change of assessment decision relating to the first provisional notional assessment is pending.


When the change of assessment decision is made, a new notional assessment is made that reflects both the change of assessment decision relating to George's income and the change in care.


## Notional assessments


A provisional notional assessment becomes a notional assessment:

• 14 days after the notice of the provisional notional assessment is received by all the parties, or
• if an application for variation was lodged, then on the day on which the Registrar varies, or refuses to vary, the provisional notional assessment.

The notional assessment is the rate of child support that would have been payable but for the child support agreement (taking into account the relevant circumstances of a case, including change of assessment) (CSA Act section 146A).


The notional assessment amount is used in calculating the relevant amount of FTB Part A payable to the payee (1.1.P.30). However, prior to the notional assessment issuing, the child support amount payable under the agreement will be used in calculating the relevant amount of FTB Part A payable to the payee.


A notional assessment will apply to all child support agreements (other than lump sum payment provisions (1.1.L.60)), where the application for acceptance is received by the Registrar on or after 1 July 2008 (CSA Act section 146B).


The Registrar must serve written notice of the notional assessment on the parties (CSA Act section 146E). Either party may object (10.2.2) to the particulars of the notional assessment (CSRC Act section 80(1) item 14A). If aggrieved by the objection (1.1.O.10) decision they may then apply to theART(1.1.A.40) for review of the objection decision (10.3.1).


## Later provisional notional assessments


The Registrar must make a new provisional notional assessment in the following circumstances:

• Three years after the most recent notional assessment relating to the agreement was made
• On the request of either party (only if the relevant agreement is a limited child support agreement)
• If the amount of child support payable for a day under the relevant agreement or order changes by more than 15% from the previous day

# 6.4.1 Changing a child support agreement


## Context


Child support (1.1.C.60) agreements cannot be varied and remain in force until they end or are terminated (6.4.2).


Changes can be made to the relevant liability in line with the provisions of the agreement.

• Change in circumstances while a child support agreement is in place

## Changing a child support agreement


Child support agreements cannot be varied. However, child support agreements may be terminated and replaced with another child support agreement and can make reference to provisions in a previous child support agreement.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 80CA No variation of binding child support agreements, section 80F No variation of limited child support agreements


## Change in circumstances while a child support agreement is in place


Child support agreements remain in force until they end or are terminated. Changes can be made to the assessment in line with the provisions of the agreement.


Example:On 1 December 2019 the Registrar accepts a binding child support agreement (1.1.B.30) for Valdemar and Naomi that states that Valdemar is to provide $50 a week to Naomi for child Emanuela. Naomi has full-time care (1.1.C.10) of Emanuela. The agreement also states that upon care changing to Valdemar, Naomi will be required to pay Valdemar $20 per week. On 1 January 2022 Emanuela moves into the full-time care of Valdemar. The agreement continues to be in force and the assessment is adjusted in line with the agreement that Naomi will pay Valdemar $20 a week.


However, where the agreement does not make provision for a change in circumstances, the agreement will continue to be enforced according to its terms, until it ends or is terminated.


Example:On 1 December 2018 the Registrar accepts a binding child support agreement for Aron and Pema that states that Aron is to provide $50 a week to Pema for child Jorrit. Pema has full-time care of Jorrit. There is no provision in the agreement to take into account a change in care arrangements. On 1 January 2021 Jorrit moves into the 65% care of Aron and there has been no substantial change in the incomes of Aron and Pema from when the agreement commenced. The agreement continues in force with the requirement for Aron to pay Pema $50 a week (even though Aron now has 65% care of Jorrit) until the agreement ends or is terminated.


Example:On 1 October 2020 the Registrar accepted a limited child support agreement (1.1.L.40) made on 1 July 2018 for Jimi and Teresinha that states Jimi is to provide $50 a week to Teresinha for child Branka. Teresinha has full-time care of Branka at the time the agreement is accepted. The agreement has no provisions for what would happen if Branka went into a shared care (1.1.S.40) arrangement between both Jimi and Teresinha.


On 15 August 2021 Jimi and Teresinha move to each having 50% care of Branka. The agreement continues to be in force with the requirement for Jimi to pay Teresinha $50 a week (even though Jimi now has 50% care of Branka).


As the agreement was not made more than 3 years ago, neither Jimi nor Teresinha can give the Registrar written notice of the termination of the agreement. However, a party to the agreement may request a new notional assessment (NA) (1.1.N.20). If the amount under the new NA varies by more than 15% compared to the previous NA, and as the agreement did not contemplate the change in circumstances related to the change in care for Branka, either Jimi or Teresinha can give the Registrar written notice of the termination of the agreement within 60 days of receiving notice of the new NA.


Example:On 1 January 2015 the Registrar accepted a limited child support agreement for Reed and Vasu made on 15 December 2014 that states Reed is to provide $100 a week to Vasu for child Tomas. Vasu has full-time care of child Tomas. There is no provision in the agreement to take into account a change in care arrangements. On 1 July 2021 Tomas moves into the 65% care of Reed. The agreement continues to be in force with the requirement for Reed to pay Vasu $100 a week (even though Reed now has 65% care of Tomas).


As the agreement was made more than 3 years ago, either Reed or Vasu can give the Registrar written notice of the termination of the agreement. This can be done at any time and does not require the agreement of the other party.


From 1 July 2018, when a party to an agreement who is entitled to be paid child support is no longer an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) of the child, the agreement may be suspended (6.4.3). If that party to the agreement does not become an eligible carer again before the period of suspension ends, the agreement is terminated from the day that party originally ceased to be an eligible carer (6.4.2).


Example:Donna and Josh have an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) under the formula in place. On 1 March 2019 the Registrar accepted a binding child support agreement for Donna and Josh made on 23 January 2019 that states Donna is to provide $200 a week to Josh for child Rodney. Josh has full-time care of child Rodney.


On 1 February 2020 Rodney moves into the full-time care of Donna. As Josh is no longer an eligible carer for child Rodney, the agreement is suspended. Donna does not pay $200 a week to Josh during this suspension period. Child support is paid in line with the provisions of the formula, so that Josh is liable to provide $40 a week to Donna for child Rodney.


Donna and Josh do not take action to extend the 28 day suspension period and Donna continues to have full-time care of child Rodney. The agreement is then terminated on 1 February 2020 (being the day Josh ceased to be an eligible carer) after the suspension period ends on 29 February 2020.


Example:Clarke and Lexa separate and enter into a binding child support agreement. On 1 November 2019 an application for acceptance of the binding child support agreement was made. As child support was not already payable the start date of the agreement was the date the application for acceptance was made to the Registrar. The agreement states Lexa is to provide to Clarke $250 a week each for children Abigail and Finn. Clarke has full-time care of both children.


On 30 September 2020 Finn moves into the full-time care of Lexa. As Clarke is no longer an eligible carer for child Finn, the agreement in respect to Finn is suspended.


Both Clarke and Lexa notify the Registrar on 15 October 2020 they want the agreement suspended for longer than 28 days in respect to child Finn. The liability for child Finn is nil during the suspension period as there was no prior assessment of child support before the agreement was accepted. Lexa continues to pay $250 a week to Clarke for child Abigail during this time.


Lexa makes an election to end the CSA Act section 93 assessment (based on the agreement) in respect to Finn, and applies for a formula assessment (1.1.F.20). The agreement revives as a result of the application for formula assessment, but as Clarke is still not an eligible carer of Finn, the agreement is suspended upon revival. Child support is paid in line with the provisions of the formula for child Finn, so that Clarke is liable to provide $150 a week to Lexa for Finn.


On 1 March 2021, child Finn returns to Clarke's full-time care before the extended suspension period is over. As such, the agreement resumes its full effect on the rate of child support, and Lexa is again liable under the agreement to pay Clarke $250 a week for child Finn.

# 6.4.2 Terminating a child support agreement


## Context


There are specific ways to end child support (1.1.C.60) agreements, including to account for changed circumstances.


A child support agreement will continue to be in force until the day specified in the agreement that it ends, unless terminated earlier (see below). The end date can be express or implied. If no end date is specified, and no terminating event occurs, then the provisions of the child support agreement will continue until the child/ren covered by the agreement turn 18. If a child is still attending secondary school (1.1.S.10) after their 18th birthday, an agreement can be extended with the agreement of both parents (2.5.3) (1.1.P.10).

## Terminating a child support agreement


A binding child support agreement (1.1.B.30) can be terminated:

• by a subsequent binding child support agreement that includes a provision to the effect that the previous agreement is terminated (CSA Act section 80D(1)(a))
• by an agreement in writing to the effect that the previous child support agreement is terminated, known as a termination agreement (CSA Act section 80D(1)(b))
• by a court order setting aside the child support agreement under section 136 (CSA Act section 80D(1)(c)) (10.4.2), or
• if a parent entitled to receive child support ceases to be an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) under section 80D(2A) (CSA Act section 80D(1)(d)).

A transitional child support agreement (6.1.4) can be terminated:

• by the same methods as other binding child support agreements, or
• by an agreement in writing signed by both parties to the effect that the previous child support agreement is terminated (item 75(6) of Schedule 5 of theChild Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme, New Formula and Other Measures) Act 2006).

A limited child support agreement (1.1.L.40) can be terminated:

• by a subsequent limited or binding child support agreement that contains a provision to the effect that the previous agreement is terminated (CSA Act section 80G(1)(a))
• by an agreement in writing to the effect that the previous child support agreement is terminated (CSA Act section 80G(1)(b))
• by a court order setting aside the child support agreement under section 136 (CSA Act section 80G(1)(c)) (10.4.2)
• if a parent entitled to receive child support ceases to be an eligible carer under CSA Act section 80G(1B) (CSA Act section 80G(1)(f))
• if the notional assessment (6.3.2) (1.1.N.20) made in relation to the child support agreement differs by more than 15% from the previous notional assessment in circumstances not contemplated by the agreement, by either party electing to terminate the agreement in writing within 60 days (90 days if the parent is a resident of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (CSA Act section 80G(1A))) of receiving notice of the new notional assessment (CSA Act section 80G(1)(d)). The agreement will be terminated 28 days after the notice is received by the Registrar (CSA Act section 80G(2)(d)), or
• by either party giving written notice of termination to the Registrar (CSA Act section 80G(1)(e)), if the child support agreement was made more than 3 years prior to the notice. The agreement will be terminated 28 days after the written notice is received by the Registrar (CSA Act section 80G(2)(d)).

## Terminating an agreement when former carer continues to be entitled to child support


From 1 July 2018, where a carer entitled to be paid child support under a child support agreement ceases to be an eligible carer for the child, the agreement is terminated if:

• a party (the former carer) to the agreement who is entitled to be paid child support for the child, disregarding offsetting provisions under CSA Act section 67A, under the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 80D(2A)(a) and section 80G(1B)(a))
• the period of 28 days after the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer of the child ends without the former carer again becoming an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 80D(2A)(b) and section 80G(1B)(b))
• the agreement is not suspended under CSA Act section 86 on the day after the period ends as a result of that cessation (CSA Act section 80D(2A)(c) and section 80G(1B)(c))
• a child support terminating event does not occur under CSA Act section 12(2AA) (where both parents are not eligible carers of the child and no non-parent carers are entitled to be paid child support in relation to the child) (CSA Act section 80D(2A)(d) and section 80G(1B)(d)), and
• the former carer continues to be entitled to be paid or provided child support for the child under the agreement despite ceasing to be an eligible carer (CSA Act section 80D(2A)(e) and section 80G(1B)(e)).

The agreement terminates on the day the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 80D(3) and section 80G(2)).


Termination under CSA Act section 80D(2A) and section 80G(1B) applies to a period of 28 days (or up to 26 weeks in some circumstances) that ends on or after 1 July 2018, no matter when the agreement was made. This applies to any 28-day period of time (or up to 26 weeks) where the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer, which may have begun before 1 July 2018.


The agreement may continue in relation to other children to whom the agreement relates if the person does not cease to be an eligible carer of those children.


Where care (1.1.C.10) changes occurred before 1 July 2018, the agreement will only be terminated after that date and does not alter the effect of the agreement on the administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support for any period before 1 July 2018.


If the Registrar accepts a child support agreement, where child support is already payable by a parent for the child under an administrative assessment, and the agreement is terminated because the parent entitled to be paid child support ceases to be an eligible carer, the agreement no longer has effect (CSA Act section 34B(1), section 80D(2A), section 80G(1B)). The liability for the child would, in relation to futureCSPs (1.1.C.150), be assessed under child support formula(1.1.C.110) provisions.


If a child support agreement is accepted where child support is not already payable and the agreement is terminated because the parent entitled to be paid child support ceases to be an eligible carer, the effect of the termination is that the initiating agreement no longer has effect (CSA Act section 80D(2A), section 93(2)). To receive child support payments for the child, the parent who is an eligible carer would need to apply for an assessment under child support formula provisions since there is no assessment that existed before the child support agreement.


When a party makes an election to end the liability for a suspended agreement under CSA Act section 151(1A), and the same party applies for an administrative assessment before the liability to pay child support under the agreement ends, the agreement is revived by CSA Act section 142(1B) (2.6.2). When the agreement revives, and the former eligible carer has not regained care, the suspension period resumes and will end 28 days (or up to 26 weeks) from the original suspension commencement date. If the former eligible carer does not regain care within 28 days (or longer if an extended suspension period is in place), the agreement will terminate on the day the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 80D(3)(d) and section 80G(2)(e)).


## Terminating a limited agreement in circumstances not contemplated by the agreement


If a new notional assessment (6.3.2) differs by more than 15% from the previous notional assessment, a limited child support agreement can only be terminated where this change in the notional assessment arises 'in circumstances not contemplated' by the agreement (CSA Act section 80G(1)(d)). These circumstances need to be stipulated within the agreement itself (for example, an unemployment clause). The intentions of the parties or matters which the parties may have contemplated when entering into the agreement are irrelevant unless those intentions and contemplations are specifically taken into account in the agreement.


Example:Lula and Sebastion have a limited child support agreement with a clause that states the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable under the agreement by Lula to Sebastion will reduce in the event that Lula becomes unemployed. Lula's income reduces and the new notional assessment differs by more than 15% from the previous notional assessment. As the reduction of income was due to Lula becoming unemployed, the circumstance was contemplated by the agreement. The agreement cannot be terminated under CSA Act section 80G(1)(d).


Example:Vahagn and Livia have a limited child support agreement in relation to child Arti. The care arrangements for Arti change and a new notional assessment is issued that differs by more than 15% from the previous notional assessment. The agreement does not state that the rate of child support payable under the agreement will change if the care arrangements for child Arti change. The circumstances are therefore not contemplated by the agreement and the agreement can be terminated under CSA Act section 80G(1)(d).


## Ending child support agreements


If a child support agreement is ended by a later child support agreement and an end date is not specified, the Registrar will end the earlier agreement from the date the later agreement is signed (CSA Act section 80D(3) and section 80G(2)).


If an agreement initiated a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) because child support was not already payable (CSA Act section 93), and the agreement ends or terminates, child support will cease to be payable for a child covered by the agreement (CSA Act section 93(1)(h)). Child support is only payable until the earlier of the following days:

• the day immediately before the day on which a child support terminating event happens in relation to the child, the carer entitled to child support, the liable parent or all 3 of them
• before 1 July 2018, the day on which the agreement is terminated under CSA Act section 80D or section 80G, or
• after 1 July 2018, the day immediately before the agreement is terminated under CSA Act section 80D or section 80G.

If an agreement was accepted, where child support was already payable (CSA Act section 34B) and the agreement ends or terminates, child support will then be based on a formula assessment (1.1.F.20), except where the agreement includes a provision under which child support is to end from a specified day (CSA Act section 12(4)(a)(ii)).


Where there is a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision (departure determination) or departure order in force when the child support agreement is accepted by the Registrar, the departure determination or order is ended and will not be reinstated when the agreement ends. This is because the agreement provisions have effect as if they are a departure by consent (CSA Act section 95).


If a departure determination varied a provisional notional assessment (1.1.P.140) while the agreement was in force, this will have no effect when the agreement ends.


If an agreement includes a provision to end a child support liability from a specified day (CSA Act section 84(1)(g)) it does not prevent either party after that day from reapplying for an administrative assessment or for the acceptance of another child support agreement.


Example:Abraham and Nicole do not have a child support assessment in force and in April 2020, Abraham and Nicole apply to the Registrar to have their binding child support agreement accepted. When the Registrar accepted their agreement which set the periodic rate of child support payable by Nicole to Abraham for child Tashi for 2 years, the Registrar made a child support assessment under CSA Act section 93. In April 2022 when the child support agreement ends, all child support ceases. For child support to again be payable, either Abraham or Nicole can apply for an administrative assessment of child support (which will only commence from the date of application) or alternatively provide a new agreement for acceptance by the Registrar.


Example:Charon and Robynne have a formula based assessment of child support. In October 2021 the Registrar accepts their binding child support agreement which sets the annual rate of child support for each of their children Taryn and Tuvya and the Registrar makes an assessment under CSA Act section 34B. At the end of 10 May 2022, the agreement ends due to a provision in the agreement and child support is reassessed from 11 May 2022 based on the formula.


Example:Barrie and Ferdy have a child support assessment. The Registrar makes a change of assessment decision for the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2022. On 1 December 2019 the Registrar accepts Barrie and Ferdy's child support agreement which varies the rate of child support for the period 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021. The child support assessment continues after the child support agreement ends on 30 November 2021, and the amount payable from 1 December 2021 is reassessed based on the formula, not the change of assessment decision.


## Terminating events & child support agreements


When a terminating event under CSA Act section 12 occurs, the child support assessment ends, including where the assessment was affected by a child support agreement.


If a parent or carer later reapplies for an assessment, and the application is accepted, the assessment will generally be made using the formula assessment provisions.


A child support agreement ceases to be in force when a terminating event occurs. This is because CSA Act section 95(2) provides that the relevant agreement provisions have effect as if they were an order made by consent by a court under CSA Act Division 4 of Part 7 and CSA Act section 95(3) provides that the relevant agreement provisions have effect as if they were a statement made by a court under CSA Act section 125 in an order made under CSA Act section 124. CSA Act section 142(1) provides that such orders cease to be in force when a terminating event occurs.


However, if a parent or carer later applies for an administrative assessment after making an election under CSA Act section 151 (2.6.2) to end an assessment which was affected by a child support agreement, any new assessment must still be based on the child support agreement until the liability under the agreement would have otherwise ended. This is because CSA Act section 142(1B) provides that, if the liability is based on a child support agreement and a terminating event resulted from a section 151 election, the agreement in CSA Act section 142(1) that ceased to apply is taken to revive from the day the person makes the application for administrative assessment (CSA Act section 142(1C)).


A reference to a child support terminating event in a child support agreement made on or after 23 May 2018 is taken not to include a child support terminating event under CSA Act section 12(4)(a)(i) which relates to an election to end an assessment (2.6.2). If a child support agreement made before 23 May 2018 states the agreement will end if a terminating event occurs, depending on the wording of the agreement, the child support agreement will end and will not be revived under a new assessment.


If a child support agreement covers more than one child, and there is a terminating event for one of the children, the Registrar must amend the assessment to give effect to the terminating event.

• If the child support agreement specifies the amount payable for each child, the Registrar will amend the assessment so that it reflects the agreed amount for the remaining children.
• Before 1 July 2018, if the child support agreement simply nominates a single amount for all of the children, the Registrar cannot apportion the amount between the children. The assessment will continue to reflect the full amount payable under the agreement. However, the parties can make a new child support agreement to deal with their changed circumstances.
• On or after 1 July 2018, the Registrar may apportion the amount between the remaining children if certain criteria are met (CSA Act section 86A). See6.1.1for further information.

# 6.4.3 Suspending a child support agreement


## Context


When the carer entitled child support (1.1.C.60) under a child support agreement is no longer an eligible carer (1.1.E.10) of the child, the agreement may be suspended in relation to that child.


## Act references


CSA Actsection 5, section 7B, section 34B, section 75, section 80D, section 80G, section 86, section 86A, section 93, section 151

## Suspension of child support agreements when person is not an eligible carer


Where there is no applicable role swap clause in a child support agreement, the agreement is suspended in relation to a child if:

• a party (the former carer) to the agreement who is entitled to be paid child support for the child (disregarding offsetting provisions under CSA Act section 67A) under the agreement is not an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 86(1)(a))
• the period during which the former carer has not been an eligible carer of the child is (CSA Act section 86(1)(b))28 days or less, or26 weeks or less if this is specified in the agreement, the parties agree, or the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances (CSA Act section 86(2)
• 28 days or less, or
• 26 weeks or less if this is specified in the agreement, the parties agree, or the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances (CSA Act section 86(2)
• a child support terminating event under CSA Act section 12(2AA) does not occur (where both parents (1.1.P.10) are not eligible carers of the child and no non-parent carers are entitled to be paid child support in relation to the child) (CSA Act section 86(1)(c)), and
• the former carer would otherwise continue to be paid child support for the child under the agreement despite ceasing to be an eligible carer (CSA Act section 86(1)(d)).

If the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer of the child, a suspension period may be in effect for up to 26 weeks (CSA Act section 86(1)(b)) if:

• the child support agreement provides that the agreement is to be suspended if a party to the agreement ceases to be an eligible carer of the child for a period of more than 28 days (CSA Act section 86(2)(a))
• after the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer, each of the parties to the agreement notifies the Registrar, before the end of the 26-week period, that the parties to the agreement want the agreement suspended for more than 28 days (CSA Act section 86(2)(b)), or
• the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances in relation to the change in the care (1.1.C.10) of the child (CSA Act section 86(2)(c)).

A suspension of a child support agreement, under CSA Act section 86, starts from the day the former carer ceases to be an eligible carer. An eligible carer has at least 'shared care' of the child, which is between 35% and 65% care of the child during a care period (CSA Act section 5(3) and section 7B).


The agreement may continue without suspension in relation to other children that the agreement relates to if the person does not cease to be an eligible carer of those children.


## Effect of suspension of child support agreements


### Non-initiating agreements (child support agreements resulting in a CSA Act section 34B assessment)


A section 34B assessment is a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) that is varied in accordance with the provisions set out in a child support agreement upon the acceptance of that agreement.


When a child support agreement resulted in a section 34B assessment and the agreement is subsequently suspended, child support would be paid according to a formula assessment (1.1.F.20) to the parent who is the current eligible carer.


### Initiating agreements (child support agreements resulting in a CSA Act section 93 assessment)


A section 93 assessment is a child support assessment that arises upon the acceptance of a child support agreement where child support was not already payable before the agreement was accepted.


When a child support agreement resulted in a section 93 assessment and the agreement is subsequently suspended, child support is not payable for a child under the child support agreement where the agreement was suspended under CSA Act section 86 (CSA Act section 93(1A)). The liability for the child would be nil during the suspension period, as there was no prior assessment of child support before the Registrar accepted the agreement. However, CSA Act section 151(1A) provides an option to parties in such cases to elect to end the section 93 assessment and apply for a formula assessment. See2.6.2for further information about elections to end assessments.


Where a section 93 assessment is terminated under CSA Act section 151(1A) and the same parent who elected to end the assessment applies for a new formula assessment, the child support agreement is revived. If the parent entitled to be paid child support under the agreement is still not an eligible carer for the child, the agreement is suspended upon revival. The parent who is the eligible carer of the child may potentially receive child support payments under the formula assessment.


### Apportioning during suspension period


If the agreement ceases to relate to a child because of the suspension, the apportioning amount worked out under CSA Act section 86A(2) continues to apply in relation to each of the remaining children to whom the agreement relates. See6.1.1for further information about apportioning amounts in child support agreements.


## When suspension of child support agreements ends


If the former carer becomes an eligible carer of the child again within the 28-day (or up to 26 weeks in certain circumstances) period before the suspension ends, the child support agreement is no longer suspended. The assessment based on the agreement will resume its effect on the rate of child support payable to the parent entitled to be paid child support under the agreement.


If the 28-day (or up to 26 weeks in certain circumstances) period ends and the former carer does not become an eligible carer of the child again, the suspended agreement would terminate (CSA Act section 80D(2A) and section 80G(1B)). See6.4.2for further information about terminations of child support agreements.


When the party who makes the CSA Act section 151(1A) election, applies for an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) before the liability to pay child support under the agreement ends, the agreement is revived by CSA Act section 142(1B) (2.6.2). When the agreement revives, and the former eligible carer has not regained care, the suspension period resumes and will end 28 days (or up to 26 weeks) from the original suspension commencement date. If the former eligible carer does not regain care within 28 days (or longer if an extended suspension period is in place), the agreement will terminate on the day the former carer ceased to be an eligible carer of the child (CSA Act section 80D(3)(d) and section 80G(2)(e)).


In some situations, an agreement has already been terminated after 28 days under CSA Act section 80D(2A) or section 80G(1B) and the parties to the agreement wish to extend the suspension period despite the agreement being terminated. The Registrar can use the general amendment of assessment power under CSA Act section 75 to reflect a change between termination and suspension where parents agree (within 26 weeks of the care change) to extend the suspension period beyond 28 days (CSA Act section 86(2)).


In cases where special circumstances apply and the Registrar is not notified of the special circumstances within 26 weeks of the care change, a 26-week suspension period can apply retrospectively (CSA Act section 86(2)(c)).


## What are special circumstances?


The discretionary nature of special circumstances makes it impossible to give a precise list of factors that should be taken into account when considering whether the special circumstances provision should be applied. When considering whether special circumstances in relation to the change of care of the child/ren apply, the Registrar will look at the particular circumstances of the case. The person must explain why they have ceased to be an eligible carer of the child, and the Registrar will consider the reason for the change of care of the child together with their circumstances, to establish if they are sufficiently special for a suspension period to be granted for up to 26 weeks. Some examples of when the Registrar may be satisfied special circumstances apply include:

• the parent was seriously ill or had an accident
• the parent suffered a personal trauma such as a death in the family or a natural disaster that caused damage to the parent's property
• the parent was a victim of family violence
• there are other exceptional circumstances.

If the Registrar is satisfied that there are special circumstances, the Registrar will then consider whether it is appropriate to exercise the discretion to grant a suspension period for up to 26 weeks.

# 7 Child support collection & payment options


## Introduction


A payee (1.1.P.30) can choose how their child support (1.1.C.60) is paid – either by private collect (1.1.P.110) or by agency collect (1.1.A.50).


When child support is collected through agency collect, there are different ways the payer (1.1.P.40) can pay their ongoing liability. This is different to child support debt (1.1.C.90) enforcement which is explained in Part 8 Child support debt enforcement.


## Overview


The chapters in this part explain when child support is due and payable, collection types (private collect and agency collect), and the different ways that child support can be paid by a payer.


## In this part


This part contains the following chapters:

• 7.1 Child support – payment rates, when payments are due & payable
• 7.2 Collection types – private collect & agency collect
• 7.3 Private collect
• 7.4 Agency collect
• 7.5 Agency collect - other ways to credit child support payments

# 7.1.1 Calculating payment rates


## Calculating the daily & payment rates


When the Registrar registers a periodic maintenance liability, a daily rate payable under that maintenance liability must be calculated.


Depending on the payment period (1.1.P.50), a weekly, fortnightly, 4-weekly or monthly payment rate must also be calculated. The child support debt (1.1.C.90) will be due and payable at particular periods, depending on the payment period.


The payment rate is calculated by multiplying the daily rate by the following number of days. The daily rate can be calculated by dividing the period of the liability by the number of days in that period.


The following table shows how many days are in each period.


A daily rate is rounded up to 5 decimal places by reference to the value of the sixth decimal place.

# 7.1.2 Agency collect – payee entitlement to payment & disbursement


## Context


A payee (1.1.P.30) of a registered maintenance liability is entitled to be paid the amounts the Registrar received in the previous month for child support (1.1.C.60) due and payable by the payer (1.1.P.40) (7.1.1).

• Disbursement of child support
• Entitlement of payees of carer liabilities to payments
• Apportionment of payments between payees

## Entitlement of payees of registered maintenance liabilities to payment


The Registrar must pay a payee of a registered maintenance liability on or before the first Wednesday of the following month an amount equal to the total of the following amounts in relation to their registered maintenance liability:

• amounts deducted through employer withholding (1.1.E.20) in the previous calendar month
• other amounts the Registrar received in relation to their registered maintenance during the ‘payment period’ (1.1.P.50) for the month (7.1.1), and
• amounts not previously paid to the payee that werearrears (1.1.A.100) amounts deducted by an employer in relation to the liability, orreceived by the Registrar before the payment period (that is, previous advance payments),
• arrears (1.1.A.100) amounts deducted by an employer in relation to the liability, or
• received by the Registrar before the payment period (that is, previous advance payments),

but excluding any amount that was not due and payable by the payer (1.1.P.40) on the seventh day of the current month. The Registrar will hold these advance payments in credit and apply them against future amounts payable to the payee.


The payment period begins 8 days before the first Wednesday of the current month and ends 9 days before the first Wednesday of the following month.


Example:The Registrar is collecting child support from Myron payable to Elisabeti. On the first Wednesday in December, Elisabeti is entitled to receive:

• all payments deducted by Myron's employer during October (due to the Registrar on 7 November) including any deductions for arrears, and
• all payments, other than payments from an employer, received up until the closing day, which is 9 days before the first Wednesday in December (that is, the Monday of the week that is before the week of the first Wednesday in December), including any arrears payments
• the amount has already been paid to the payee, or
• the amount is an advance payment of a future liability.

## Disbursement of child support


### Within Australia


The Registrar is not obliged to make payments to the payee before the first Wednesday of the month following collection.


The Registrar has the discretion to pay an amount to a payee in the current month if the amount was due and payable by the payer on or before the seventh day of the current month. In practice, the Registrar will send collected payments to the payee from the 8th day of the month, and daily until the end of the month.


### Outside Australia


Disbursement to payees residing overseas occurs once per month - on/around the 10th of the month and represent collections that have occurred in the previous month. For example, payments collected in March are collated and sent as one disbursement in April.


Payments may be disbursed directly to the payee or to the overseas authority (1.1.O.30) to forward to the payee.


Funds are issued in the currency specified by the receiving country.

# 7.1.3 When child support is due & payable


## Due & payable


Child support (1.1.C.60) payable in relation to any day in a month becomes due and payable on the later of:

• the seventh day of the following month, or
• the 30th day after the liable parent (1.1.P.10) concerned was given a notice of assessment.

Act reference:CSA Actsection 78 When amounts of child support due and payable


## Due dates for payment


### Initial period


A child support debt (1.1.C.90) for days in the initial period are due and payable to the Registrar on the seventh day of the month following that day. However, if a liability starts, or is varied, on or after the day the Payer Account Statement issues (usually during the second last full weekend of the month, but this can vary), the liability is due and payable on the seventh day of the month after the following month. This takes into account the need to notify the payer (1.1.P.40) of the new or varied liability.


Example:The initial period is 28 June to 3 July. The payer must ensure that payment reaches the Registrar by, or on, 7 August.


### Voluntary payer


A child support debt for a payment period (1.1.P.50) that is made by a voluntary payer is due and payable on the seventh day after the last day of the payment period. ALPP(1.1.L.20) (8.2) is imposed on a payer when they fail to pay their child support debt by the due date.


Example:The Register states that the payer must pay $500 for each monthly pay period. This means the payer must ensure that payment reaches the Registrar by, or on, the seventh of each month.


## Employer withholding (1.1.E.20)


Information about the due dates for payment by employers who have deducted a child support debt from an employee's wage or salary is contained in section7.4.3. The payer is discharged from their liability to make payments directly to the Registrar to the extent of the amounts that the employer has deducted from their wages or salary. The payer is required to pay any shortfall to the Registrar and this is due on the seventh day after the last day of the payment period.


Example:The Register states that the payer must pay $250 each fortnight and a fortnightly period ends on the 15 June. This means the payer must ensure that payment reaches the Registrar by, or on 22 June.

# 7.1.4 Agency collect payment periods


## Context


This topic covers payment periods (1.1.P.50) when an agency collect (1.1.A.50) arrangement is in place, and applies to periodic enforceable maintenance liabilities.


See7.1.1for calculating payment rates (including daily rates).


## On this page

• Initial payment period
• Payment periods – voluntary payments
• Payment periods – employer withholding

## Initial payment period (1.1.I.40)


When the Registrar registers a maintenance liability for collection, an initial payment period must also be entered if there is one. The initial payment period starts on the day the liability becomes payable to the Registrar and ends the day before the start of the first regular payment period.


The Registrar will calculate the amount payable for this period by multiplying the daily rate (7.1.1) by the number of days in the initial period and notify the payer (1.1.P.40).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 26C Initial period that may be registered under paragraph 26(2)(a)


## Payment periods - voluntary payments


A payer can make an application to pay directly to the Registrar rather than having child support (1.1.C.60) deducted from their wages. If this election is approved, they will have a periodic child support liability for a particular payment period. A payer may make an election to make it a different period. Elections for payment periods to be weekly, fortnightly, monthly or 4-weekly will be accepted if the Registrar is satisfied this will be convenient for the payer. Where the Registrar is not satisfied that the elected payment period would be convenient for the payer, the payment period will be determined by the Registrar.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 26B Payment period to be entered in Register …


## Payment periods – employer withholding (1.1.E.20)


If the Registrar uses employer withholding to collect child support, the payment cycle will be the same as the payer's pay cycle (see7.4.3.10on paying from salary and wages). It can be weekly, fortnightly, 4 weekly or monthly. The first day of the first payment cycle will be determined by the Registrar and will be the start of the first payment period for which employer deductions will occur.

# 7.3.2 Collection of arrears during a private collect period


## Context


A payee (1.1.P.30) can change from private collect (1.1.P.110) to agency collect (1.1.A.50). If the payer (1.1.P.40) has not paid the assessed rate of child support (1.1.C.60) in full, the payee can ask the Registrar (1.2.1.10) to collect any unpaid amount in the last 3 months and 9 months in exceptional circumstances immediately before the date the liability first becomes enforceable. The Registrar will need to be satisfied that the amount have not actually been paid.


## On this page

• Application for collection of arrears
• Exceptional circumstances
• International maintenance liabilities
• Calculating amounts unpaid

## Application for collection of arrears


When the Registrar accepts a payee’s application to have their child support collection arrangement changed from private collect to agency collect, the payee can also apply for Services Australia to collect arrears for them (section 28A).


The Registrar must accept the payee's application for collection of the amounts the payer has not paid in the 3 months immediately before the date the liability first becomes enforceable (before agency collect commenced). The Registrar will need to be satisfied that the amounts have actually not been paid.


A payee may also apply for collection of amounts unpaid by the payer for 9 months before the liability first becomes enforceable. This is called the maximum arrears period. If there are amounts unpaid for this period and the Registrar is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, the application must be granted.


If the Registrar grants the payee's application, the unpaid amounts become a child support debt and the Register (1.2.1.10) will be varied to show that the payer owes these unpaid amounts.


In some cases payees may apply for agency collect after the Registrar amends a child support assessment retrospectively so that there are significant arrears arising (for example, it may replace a default income or reconcile an estimate of income). These arrears arise through the ordinary operation of the Act and are not an exceptional circumstance even if the payee was unaware of any change in the payer's circumstances.


## Exceptional circumstances


Whether circumstances are exceptional will depend on the facts in each particular case. The circumstances must be unusual in some way. They may be circumstances beyond the control of the payee that prevented them from applying for collection within a reasonable period. The Registrar will consider the effect of the particular circumstances on the payee and the extent to which they contributed to the payee's delay in applying for collection.


The following are examples of circumstances that the Registrar may consider exceptional. This is not an exhaustive list and each case must be considered on its merits.

• The payer threatened or pressured the payee not to apply for collection by Services Australia (see also1.4.1).
• The payee was ill or had an accident that stopped them from applying for collection.
• The payee suffered a personal trauma such as a death in the family or a natural disaster that caused damage to the payee's property.
• The payee had communication difficulties because of, or including, isolation, illiteracy or poor English language skills.
• The payer created a false expectation of payment (for example, they promised to pay a lump sum from the proceeds of the sale of property or a compensation settlement).
• The parents were involved in negotiations over child support and/or other matters and applying for collection may have compromised those negotiations.

The payee must provide suitable evidence for the Registrar to find there are exceptional circumstances. For example, if the payee states that the payer threatened or pressured them they may provide evidence from a person fully aware of the nature and details of the circumstances such as a doctor, social welfare worker or police officer.


In the case of illness, accident or psychiatric condition, the payee should provide written confirmation from a medical practitioner. In other cases, the payee must supply a full and detailed explanation supported by appropriate evidence.


The Registrar must provide the payer with an opportunity to comment on information the payee provided to the Registrar if that information is being taken into account to make a decision to grant an application for a maximum arrears period.


## International maintenance liabilities


An amount of arrears arising under a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (1.5.3.10) can be registered for agency collect. This type of liability is not limited to 3 or 9 months if the liability arose before the day on which the application for registration is received by the Registrar.


However, if the arrears (1.1.A.100) arose during a private collect period after registration, the 3 or 9 month time limit applies if the payee later opts in to agency collect.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 18A Liability in relation to registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


Policy reference:CS Guide1.5.3.10Registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


## Calculating amounts unpaid


In some cases parents may provide conflicting information about payments made during the relevant arrears period. If there is a dispute over the amount of unpaid child support, the Registrar will make reasonable investigations before reaching a decision on the amount owing in the arrears period. This would include contacting both parents to seek details of payment dates and amounts, the period to which the payments apply, and any supporting evidence that supports their claims.


Supporting evidence may include:

• bank statements showing amounts transferred from the payer to the payee
• bank statements recording the withdrawal of the amount paid to the payee for child support
• receipts from the payee
• other records, such as letters or emails, about payments made or owing in the arrears period.

The Registrar will take into account any amounts that the payer has previously paid that would qualify as a prescribed non-agency payment (7.5.2) when calculating the amounts unpaid. If the payer has paid 70% of the liability directly to the payee, the Registrar will credit any further amounts that would qualify as prescribed non-agency payments towards the remaining 30% of the liability.


If the parents do not agree and the Registrar cannot be satisfied based on the information and evidence available that payment was made for some or all of the arrears period being claimed, the arrears claim will be accepted.

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 7.3.1.10 Opting out to private collect


## Changing from agency to private collect


If a child support liability has an agency collect (1.1.A.50) arrangement, the payee (1.1.P.30) (or payee and payer (1.1.P.40) jointly) can make an election to opt out to private collect (1.1.P.110).


An election to change from agency collect to private collect does not end the payer's liability to pay child support (1.1.C.60). Any amounts payable under an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) or court order continue to be payable, but they become payable to the payee rather than the Commonwealth.


The payee may also elect for the Registrar to not collect any arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support.


Information on when private collect is an appropriate option is provided in7.4.1.40.


## Making an election


A payee can make an election to change from agency to private collect. The payee and payer can make a joint election to change from agency to private collect. A payer cannot make an election to change from agency collect to private collect unless the payee also agrees.


An election to change collection methods can be made in writing, on an approved form or by phone. The election must specifically indicate that the payee (or the payer and payee jointly) chooses for the Registrar to stop collecting child support. The election may specify a date from which the Registrar should cease to collect the child support but this is not a requirement.


The payee making the election can also elect for the Registrar not to collect any arrears of child support.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on making of child support assessment, section 30 Effect of registration, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


## Agency collect ceases from a specified terminating day


The Registrar must accept an election to change from agency collect to private collect. The Registrar will vary the particulars in the Child Support Register (1.2.1.10) to show that the liability ceased to be enforceable by the Registrar from a specified terminating day. The Registrar must specify a terminating day that is no more than 60 days after the election was received. The terminating day cannot be a day in a low income non-enforcement period.

• nominated a date for the Registrar to end collection, the Registrar will use that date
• did not nominate a date for the Registrar to end collection, the Registrar will use the date that the election was received as the terminating date.

The Registrar will check whether the proposed terminating day would result in any overpayment (1.1.O.20) to the payee. If so, the Registrar will discuss options with the payee including delaying the start date of the election until no overpayment is created.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on making of child support assessment, section 30 Effect of registration, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


## Effect of an election to end collection when there is a role reversal


There are certain circumstances (for example, a change in care) which create a role reversal. A role reversal results in the former payee now becoming the new payer, and the former payer now becoming the new payee. A liability as a result of a role reversal creates a new registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) which the Registrar must register for collection. The new payee (or the payee and payer jointly) can elect for the Registrar to end agency collect. Any previous election made by the payer or payee to end agency collect will not apply to the new liability created as a result of the role reversal.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on making of child support assessment, section 30 Effect of registration, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


## Election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears


When a payee (or payer and payee jointly) elects to change from agency collect to private collect, they can also elect for the Registrar not to collect any arrears. This election does not change how much child support is assessed to be paid, but means the Registrar is not required to collect the unpaid child support and instead the money is payable to the payee.


If the payee is currently in receipt of more than the base rate ofFTBPart A, the payee should consider the implications for FTB if they change from agency collect to private collect and/or if they elect for the Registrar to not collect any child support arrears. This is because the assessed amount of child support will be applied to theMIT, even if the payee has agreed the Registrar is not required to collect this amount.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on making of child support assessment, section 25 Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability, section 30 Effect of registration, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


Policy references:FA Guide3.1.7Maintenance income test


## Changes to the liability after an election to end agency collect


The Registrar may vary a child support liability after that liability has ended or ceased to be enforced (agency collect). This may occur when a parent (1.1.P.10) lodges their tax return and the Registrar uses this information to reconcile the parent's income estimate (3.4) or to replace a provisional income (1.1.P.130).


If the Registrar varies a liability that accrued during an agency collect period, this can result in further unpaid amounts for that period. Child support arrears for an agency collect past period will be payable to the Registrar. However, the payee can elect for the Registrar not to collect any arrears arising from subsequent changes to the liability. The Registrar will explain to the payee the possible consequences of an election to end collection of amounts payable under a child support assessment based on a default income or estimate.


If the payee is in receipt of more than the base rate of FTB Part A, the payee should consider the implications for FTB of their election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears. See FA Guide3.1.6.70.


Example:Samuel and Madina, a payer and payee, jointly elect for the Registrar to end collection of child support. At the same time, they elect for the Registrar not to collect unpaid amounts. Samuel and Madina's assessment is based upon Samuel's estimate of taxable income. The Registrar gives effect to Samuel and Madina's election by specifying a terminating day, which is the date of Samuel and Madina's election, and varies the Register to show that the overdue amounts are no longer payable to the Registrar.


Three months later, Samuel lodges his tax return. It shows that Samuel's actual taxable income was higher than his estimated income. The Registrar reconciles Samuel's estimate and increases Samuel and Madina's child support assessment. Samuel must pay extra child support to the Registrar for the days before the specified terminating day. Samuel and Madina can make their own arrangements for paying the extra child support for the specified terminating day and all subsequent days.

# 7.2 Collection types – private collect & agency collect


## Introduction


The Registrar is responsible for assessing how much child support (1.1.C.60) is payable for an assessment, however, the payee (1.1.P.30) can choose how their child support is paid – either by private collect (1.1.P.110) or by agency collect (1.1.A.50).


## Collection type – responsibility for collecting child support


In an 'agency collect' arrangement, the Registrar assesses and collects any amount payable, and disburses it to the payee when the payment is received.


In a 'private collect' arrangement, the Registrar assesses how much child support should be paid and the parents (1.1.P.10) then exchange the payments directly between themselves. Parents can exchange the payments in any way they agree, such as by cash or direct bank transfer. Private collection encourages parents to determine their own arrangements and enforce collection of their own liabilities. Any disputes about private child support debts (1.1.C.90) must be resolved through mediation or in court, in the same way as other types of privately enforceable debts.


## Changing collection type


The payee can ask the Registrar to change the collection type (that is, they can move from private collect to agency collect (7.4.1.10) or from agency collect to private collect (7.3.1.10).


If a payee opts in to agency collect, they can ask the Registrar to collect arrears (1.1.A.100) that have accrued during the private collect period. More information is available at7.3.2.


## Collection type & implications forFTB


It is important for payees to understand the rules that apply to each collection type, and any flow-on impacts to FTB to make sure the decision they make around collection is right for their circumstances.


Topic1.4.2provides information on how the child support collection type affects how child support is applied to the FTB Part AMIT.

# 7.4.1.10 Reapplying for agency collect


## Context


A payee (1.1.P.30) with a private collect (1.1.P.110) arrangement can apply for agency collect (1.1.A.50). The payee can apply for Services Australia to collect arrears that have accrued during a private collect period. More information is available in7.3.2.


## On this page

• Application for agency collect
• Collection of arrears if the Registrar accepts the payee's application for collection to resume

## Application for the Registrar to again collect the liability


If the Registrar (1.2.1.10) ends collection (7.4.1.40) because the payer (1.1.P.40) had a satisfactory payment record, or because the payee (or payee and payer jointly) elected to end collection (move to private collect), the payee can later reapply for collection to resume.


The payee can make their application in writing, by telephone, in person, or electronically by completing aformon the Services Australia website. The payee can also apply for the Registrar to collect arrears for them.


A payee cannot make an application for agency collect during a low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4).


Unlike a first election for collection (at the time of application), the Registrar is not obliged to accept the payee's application for collection to resume. The Registrar can grant or refuse the payee's application and must do so within 28 days of receiving it, or within 90 days if either the payer or payee is a resident of an overseas jurisdiction.


The Registrar must grant the application unless satisfied that:

• the payer has been complying with their child support (1.1.C.60) obligations
• the payer has satisfactorily explained their failure to meet their obligations and rectified that failure, or
• special circumstances exist in relation to the liability that make it appropriate for the Registrar to refuse the application.

If the Registrar accepts the payee's application, the Register (1.2.1.10) must be varied by specifying a date that the liability again becomes enforceable, which cannot be more than 60 days after Services Australia received the application for collection. Nor can it be a day included in a low-income non-enforcement period.


The Registrar will usually determine that the liability is first enforceable from the date Services Australia received the payee's application for collection to resume. It may sometimes be appropriate to make the liability enforceable from a later day, for example if the payee has received an advance payment but since then the payer has indicated that no further payments will be made.


If the payee made their application by lodging a form at a service centre, the Registrar will accept this as the date the payee's application was received.


When the Registrar accepts a payee's application for agency collect to apply, the Registrar can also collect unpaid amounts for a specified arrears (1.1.A.100) period. See7.3.2for information on how unpaid amounts are calculated.


### Complying with child support obligations


A payer has complied with their child support obligations if they pay the maintenance liability when it is due. In determining whether compliance has been met, the Registrar will examine the evidence provided by both parties such as bank statements, automatic transfer of payments, cheque butts and written statements.


A child support obligation is considered to have been complied with if the payer has made a payment of a kind prescribed in section 19 of the CSRC Regs, that would be credited against the ongoing liability if the case was registered for agency collect and the payment was sufficient to meet the liability. The payer must have also paid 70% of the ongoing liability directly to the payee by the date it was due. The Registrar will give both parties the opportunity to make statements and provide evidence about whether the payments have been made.


### The payer has satisfactorily explained their failure to meet their obligations & rectified that failure


The payer must satisfactorily explain why they failed to meet their obligations and have rectified that failure. Examples of a satisfactory explanation as to why a payer failed to meet their child support obligations may include:

• bank errors, employer errors or postal delays
• failure to receive notification of the requirement to pay directly to the payee
• failure to understand the notification because of poor English language skills or illiteracy
• the payee failed to provide details to enable the payer to make payments directly to them
• a serious illness or accident of the payer or someone close to them prevented the payer from making the payment
• natural disasters meant that the payment could not be made
• a payer is mistaken as to the date the payment is due and payable (due dates may be different when the case is privately collected)
• arrears arose because of a retrospective change to the liability and the payer has complied with an agreement with the payee to pay off those arrears over time. The payee is entitled to payment on due dates and may request payment of all arrears at any time despite such an agreement. However, if the payer has been paying arrears as agreed with the payee and makes full payment at the request of the payee then they will be considered to have taken necessary action to meet their child support obligations
• personal trauma causing severe stress or hardship (such as a death in the payer's family or a natural disaster that damages a payer's home) may diminish the relative importance of meeting their maintenance obligation
• the payer forgot to make a payment and has made arrangements so that this does not happen again, or
• the payer made a payment by cheque that was later dishonoured.

The Registrar will take into account the following factors when considering whether the payer has taken action to meet their child support obligations:

• payments being made as soon as possible after the circumstances outlined above, either directly by themselves or by arranging for automatic transfer of the maintenance liability from their bank or employer
• complying with an agreement with the payee to pay off arrears over time, or
• arrangement made so cheques are no longer dishonoured.

### Special circumstances exist that make it appropriate for the Registrar to refuse the application


Even though the Registrar may not be satisfied a payer has complied or rectified a failure to comply, there may be special circumstances that exist in relation to the liability that make it appropriate to refuse the application.


Example:Juan applied for collection to resume because Valentina missed that month's payment, however Valentina is currently in hospital and has agreed to rectify that failure to comply on release from hospital the following week. The Registrar is satisfied the payment will be made and that it is appropriate to refuse the application.


When the payee applies for collection, Services Australia will contact the payer. If the payer provides a reason why they believe their circumstances are special such that the application for collection should be refused, Services Australia will give the payee an opportunity to comment on the reason the payer has given. The Registrar will then make a decision based on the information and evidence provided by both parties.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 39(5)(c) there are special circumstances that exist …


Policy references:CS Guide9.2.4Suspension for unemployment (low-income non-enforcement period),7.3.2Collection of arrears during a private collect period,7.4.1.40Registrar-initiated ending of collection


## Collection of arrears if the Registrar accepts the payee's application for collection to resume


A payee who applies for collection to resume can also apply for the Registrar to collect arrears for them. More information is provided in7.3.2.

# 7.4.1.20 Agency collect – the date the liability becomes enforceable


## Context


The Registrar must work out the day that a liability is first enforceable when it is registered. The start date will depend on the circumstances in which the liability is registered for collection.


See7.4.1.10for more information for cases where the payee (1.1.P.30) applies to opt in to agency collect (1.1.A.50).


## On this page

• New child support assessments
• Existing child support assessments
• Court orders for periodic maintenance made from 1 June 1988 (or agreements registered in a court from that date)
• Court orders for periodic maintenance made before 1 June 1988 (or agreements registered in a court before that date)
• Child or spouse maintenance liabilities transferred from state or territory collection agencies
• Overseas maintenance liabilities & agency reimbursement liabilities
• Recovery orders

## New child support assessments


When the Registrar makes a new child support assessment (1.1.C.70) (including an assessment made in accordance with a child support agreement) they must register the liability unless:

• the payee elected for private collect (1.1.P.110) when they applied, or
• the payer (1.1.P.40) applied for the child support assessment.

The liability first becomes enforceable from the start date of the child support assessment.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register …, section 28 Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


Policy reference:CS Guide2.1Applying for a child support assessment


## Existing child support assessments


A payee can apply for agency collect if the Registrar did not previously register it for collection because:

• the payee elected for private collect when they applied for the child support assessment, or
• the payer applied for the child support assessment.

The Registrar must register the liability and decide the day from which the liability first becomes enforceable by Services Australia. This will usually be from the day Services Australia received the payee's application for agency collect.


The Registrar may decide to make the liability enforceable from a later date. That day must not be more than 60 days after Services Australia received the application for collection.


Example:Liam lodged an application for collection on 15 February 2025. Liam advised Services Australia that the liable parent, Jessica, made a lump sum payment on 1 January 2025 that was to cover the full amount of the liability until 1 April 2025. The Registrar determined the liability was first enforceable on 2 April 2025.


The payee can also apply for Services Australia to collect arrears for them (7.3.2).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25 Application for registration …, section 28 Day on which liability first becomes enforceable, section 28A Reversal of subsection 23(3) or 24A(2) election …


## Court orders for periodic maintenance made from 1 June 1988 (or agreements registered in a court from that date)


### Payee notified Services Australia within 14 days of the court making the order or registering the agreement


If the payee or payer notifies Services Australia within 14 days of the court making the order or registering the agreement, the Registrar must register the liability. The periodic maintenance liability first becomes enforceable from the date the liability arose under, or was affected by that particular order or agreement.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 28(1)(b) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


### Payee notified Services Australia more than 14 days after the court made the order or registered the agreement


If the payee notified Services Australia more than 14 days after the court made the order or registered the agreement, the Registrar can register the liability. The Registrar must decide the day from which the periodic maintenance liability first becomes enforceable, which must not be before the date the liability arose under, or was affected by that particular order or agreement.


The Registrar will generally determine that the liability is first enforceable from the date the payee's application for agency collect was received. The Registrar may decide that the liability is first enforceable from a day before Services Australia received the payee's application for collection if satisfied that the payee:

• was prevented from notifying Services Australia within the prescribed 14-day period, and
• notified Services Australia of the order or agreement within a reasonable period of it being practicable for them to do so.

Example:Emir notified Services Australia of a court order for spousal maintenance on 15 July 2024. The court made the order on 16 June 2024, but Emir did not receive a sealed copy of the order from the court until 7 July 2024. The Registrar is satisfied that it was reasonable for Emir to wait for a copy of the order before notifying Services Australia that the order was made. The Registrar is also satisfied that Emir applied for collection of the order within a reasonable period of receiving a copy. The Registrar decides that the liability is first enforceable from the date the liability arose under the order.


There will also be occasions where the payee obtained a copy of the court order in time to lodge their application within 14 days but could not do so for other reasons. The Registrar will consider these reasons in deciding whether it would be appropriate to make the liability enforceable from a date earlier than the date the payee applied.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24(2) Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on receipt of notification etc., section 28(1)(baa) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


### Payee originally elected for private collect


If the Registrar did not register a court order or court registered agreement because the payee elected for a private collect arrangement, the payee can later opt in to agency collect.


The Registrar must register the liability and decide the day from which the periodic maintenance liability first becomes enforceable, which cannot be more than 60 days after Services Australia received the application for collection.


The Registrar will decide that the liability is first enforceable from the date the payee's application for agency collect was received.


The payee can also apply for Services Australia to collect arrears (1.1.A.100) for them.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25(1) Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability, section 28(1)(c) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


### Payee has never notified Services Australia of the court order or court registered agreement


The Registrar has a discretion to register a periodic maintenance liability arising from a court order or court registered agreement made on or after 1 June 1988 (or an agreement registered in a court on or after that date) even if the payee has never notified Services Australia about the order or agreement. This would be done only in exceptional circumstances.


The Registrar must decide the day from which the liability first becomes enforceable by Services Australia, which cannot be before the date the liability arose under, or was affected by that particular order or agreement. The Registrar would decide on a day depending upon the exceptional circumstances that made it appropriate for the Registrar to register the liability, irrespective of the fact that the payee failed to notify Services Australia of the order or agreement.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24(2) Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on receipt of notification etc., section 28(1)(baa) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


### The date of effect of a periodic maintenance liability under court order or court registered agreement


The Registrar may need to decide the date a periodic maintenance liability arose under or was affected by an order or agreement when registering a liability for collection.


Some orders and agreements simply specify that an amount is to be paid each week or some other period, without tying the amount to a specific period. The following table sets out how the Registrar will determine the date the liability first becomes enforceable.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 28 Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


## Court orders for periodic maintenance made before 1 June 1988 (or agreements registered in a court before that date)


If a payee applies for registration of a court order made before 1 June 1988 (or an agreement registered in a court before that date), the Registrar must register the liability. The Registrar must decide the day from which the periodic maintenance liability first becomes enforceable. This must not be more than 60 days after Services Australia received the application for collection.


The Registrar will decide that the liability is first enforceable from the date the payee's application for agency collect is received.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 25(2) Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability, section 28(1)(c) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


## Child or spouse maintenance liabilities transferred from state or territory collection agencies


The Registrar can register a periodic maintenance liability transferred from a state collection agency. The liability is enforceable from the date the liability is transferred to the Registrar.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 28(1)(a) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


## Overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40) & agency reimbursement liabilities


The Registrar can register an overseas maintenance liability or an agency reimbursement liability for collection. An overseas maintenance liability is first enforceable on the day on which the application for registration is received by Services Australia. Any amounts that are in arrears under the order are also enforceable under the CSRC Act, and also become first enforceable on the day on which the application for registration is received by Services Australia.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 18A Liabilities in relation to …, section 28(1)(d) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act, section 28(1)(e) Day on which liability first becomes enforceable under Act


## Recovery orders


A recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) is an order requiring repayment of a specified amount, rather than a periodic maintenance liability.


The Registrar will register for collection any amounts that have yet to be paid by the payer of the order to the payee. If the court has specified in the order a rate at which the overpayment is to be repaid, the Registrar will register the debt for collection at this rate, ending when the specified amount is repaid in full.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 17A Liabilities in relation to persons who have paid amounts where no liability to pay because the person is not the parent

# 7.4.1.30 How registrable maintenance liabilities are registered


## Context


The Registrar (1.2.1.10) registers a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) for collection by entering details of the liability in the Register (1.2.1.10).


## On this page

• Registering a registrable maintenance liability
• The effect of registering a registrable maintenance liability
• Particulars to be entered in the Child Support Register

## Registering a registrable maintenance liability


The Registrar must register a registrable maintenance liability for collection when a payee (1.1.P.30) notifies Services Australia of that liability. The Registrar will not register a registrable maintenance liability for collection if the payee elects for private collect (1.1.P.110).


The Registrar registers a registrable maintenance liability by entering particulars of the liability in the Register.


See9.3.3for more detail about the notification requirements and what occurs when the payer (1.1.P.40) or a court notifies the Registrar of a registrable maintenance liability.


The Registrar must register a child support (1.1.C.60) liability for collection when a payee's application for a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) is accepted unless the payee elects for Services Australia not to collect that liability for them. The Registrar will not register a child support liability for collection if the payer applied for that child support.


An assessment with a zero annual rate (1.1.A.70) does not create a registrable maintenance liability, and therefore cannot be registered by the Registrar. If, however, a liability does become payable in the future, the Registrar must register the liability but the payee (or the payee and payer jointly) can elect for the Registrar to end collection of the liability. Election to end agency collect and opt in to private collect is discussed in more detail in7.3.1.10.


There are certain circumstances (for example, a change in care (1.1.C.10) or income) which create a role reversal. A role reversal results in the payee becoming the new payer, and the payer becoming the new payee. A liability that arises as a result of a role reversal creates a new registrable maintenance liability which the Registrar must record on the register for collection. The new payee (or the payee and payer jointly) can elect for the Registrar to end agency collect and move to private collect.


A payee of a registrable maintenance liability that has not been registered with Services Australia can apply for that liability to be registered. The Registrar must register the liability when the payee's application for registration is received. However, there is an exception to this when the Registrar is only notified of an earlier registrable liability after a later maintenance liability (which relates to the same payer, payee and child/ren) has already been registered. The earlier liability cannot be registered except for the purpose of facilitating the recovery of arrears (1.1.A.100) under it. This is discussed in more detail in1.5.3.20.


Different rules apply if the Registrar has previously registered the registrable liability but ceased to enforce it because the payee elected to end collection by Services Australia, or because the Registrar made a decision to end collection by Services Australia. In these cases, the liability remains on the Register, but it ceased to be enforceable on a specified day. The payee can apply again for collection by Services Australia. The Registrar is not required to accept the payee's application. This is discussed in more detail in1.5.3.30.


If the liability is a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (1.5.3.10) and the payee seeking registration of the liability is resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10), the liability can only be registered where the application for registration is made by or via the relevant overseas authority (1.1.O.30). Even if the application for registration is correctly made, the Registrar may refuse to register the liability if registration would be inconsistent with international maintenance obligations.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 23(3) The payee is not required to give the Registrar notice under subsection (2) …, section 24 Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on receipt of notification etc., section 24A Registrar to register liability in Child Support Register on making of child support assessment, section 25 Application for registration of registrable maintenance liability, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly, section 38B Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors, section 39 Application for variation to enable liability to again become enforceable under Act


## The effect of registering a registrable maintenance liability


If the Registrar registers a registrable maintenance liability, the amounts payable under the liability become a debt due to the Commonwealth, in accordance with the details of the Register. The payee no longer has the right to enforce payment of the liability in a court, except by instituting proceedings under CSRC Act section 113A. See8.4.5.


The methods available to Services Australia to collect child support are discussed in the following Parts:

• Part 7Child support collection and payment options
• Part 8Child support debt enforcement.

Services Australia pays to the payee the amounts that it collects in respect of the liability.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 30 Effect of registration, section 113A Recovery of debts by payees


## Particulars to be entered in the Child Support Register


The following particulars of the maintenance liability must be entered in the Register.

# 7.4.1.40 Registrar-initiated ending of collection


## Context


The Registrar can require parents (1.1.P.10) to collect child support (1.1.C.60) privately, despite the parents not having made an election for private collect (1.1.P.110). The Registrar will only make a decision for private collect to apply in cases where:

• the payer (1.1.P.40) has a satisfactory payment record for the past 6 months
• the Registrar is satisfied that the payer will continue to pay their child support on time, and
• the Registrar is satisfied that private collect is appropriate for the parties involved.

## On this page

• Satisfactory payment record
• All child support paid on time over the past 6 months
• Is the payer likely to continue to make their payments on time?
• Is private collection appropriate?
• Exceptional difficulties

## Satisfactory payment record


There are 3 prescribed criteria for deciding whether a payer has a satisfactory payment record. These are:

• the payer's liability has been registered for collection for at least the past 6 months
• the payer has no child support arrears (1.1.A.100), and
• the payer has either paid all their child support on time over the last 6 months, or there are circumstances that satisfactorily explain any late payment.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 38B Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors


CSRC Regssection 18 Satisfactory payment record


## All child support paid on time over the past 6 months


A payer who makes payments directly to the Registrar will be considered to have paid their child support on time over the past 6 months if they paid their monthly liability in full over the past 6 months within 7 days of the due date.


A payer who makes payments via employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3) will be considered to have paid their child support on time over the past 6 months if Services Australia received the full expected employer deduction in each of the past 6 months and the deductions covered the payer's full liability for each payment period (1.1.P.50).


Where the employer has deducted the scheduled amount from the payer's salary or wages, but remitted the deductions to Services Australia after the due date, the Registrar will still be satisfied that the payer has paid the amounts on time. When the amounts deducted by an employer are not sufficient to cover a payer's full liability in one or more payment periods in the past 6 months, the payer will still have a satisfactory payment record if they make the missing payments directly to the Registrar within 7 days of the due date.


A payer who makes payments for part or all of their child support liability by the credit of non-agency payments (7.5.1) for the past 6 months will be considered to have paid their child support if the non-agency payment/s were paid or transferred to the payee (1.1.P.30) or to a third party within 7 days of the due date for the payment period in which the liability accrued.


A payer who has not paid all their child support on time over the past 6 months may still have a satisfactory payment record if there are circumstances that satisfactorily explain the late payment. The circumstances which satisfactorily explain late payments include:

• a payer was physically unable to make their usual child support payment by the due date because of an illness or injury (and the payer paid their entire child support liability as soon as it was possible to do so)
• the payer was unable to make the usual child support payment because they were personally providing care for their spouse or child during a serious illness (and the payer paid their entire child support liability as soon as it was possible to do so)
• a retrospective variation is made to the liability. A payer may have had arrears of child support over the past 6 months which they have repaid by adhering to a satisfactory payment arrangement. If those arrears arose from a retrospective variation which was not due to the payer's action (or inaction), the payer can still be taken to have a satisfactory payment record.

Example:The Registrar retrospectively increased Jerrod's child support assessment for the past year after Fatima (the payee) applied for a change of assessment because of the extra costs of orthodontic work for their child. Jerrod was up to date with his child support payments before the increase. Jerrod has paid his new rate of child support on time each month since the increase. Jerrod did not have sufficient funds available to pay the full amount of arrears when they were due. Jerrod entered into a payment arrangement with Services Australia to repay the arrears over 8 months. Jerrod made all the agreed payments and his child support is now up to date.


Although Jerrod had arrears over the past 6 months, Jerrod is taken to have a satisfactory payment record because there are circumstances that satisfactorily explain the late payment.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 38B Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors


CSRC Regssection 18 Satisfactory payment record


Policy reference:CS Guide7.5.1Non-agency payments


## Is the payer likely to continue to make their payments on time?


A payer who has made timely payments of child support for at least 6 months will generally be considered likely to continue to make their payments on time. Where the payer had a poor payment history before the 6-month period, the Registrar will consider whether the payer is likely to voluntarily pay their child support to the payee without Services Australia's involvement.


The Registrar will consider the following when deciding whether a payer will continue to make their payments on time (this list is not exhaustive):

• reasons for late payment of any monthly child support payment
• the payer's cooperativeness in repaying this debt
• whether the Registrar took any enforcement action in the past 12 to 18 months (including intercepting tax refunds)
• where the Registrar has been collecting by employer withholding, whether there were arrears at the time that commenced
• any statements by the payer that establish a clear intention not to pay if not compelled to do so
• the reasons for the failure of any previous private arrangement within the past 12 to 18 months, and
• if 2 or more private arrangements have failed in the last 3 to 5 years, the reasons for those failures.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 38B Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors


## Is private collection appropriate?


The Registrar must be satisfied that private payment arrangements are appropriate in the circumstances of the case. The Registrar considers that it is appropriate for parents to make private payment arrangements if satisfied that those arrangements are sustainable. A private payment arrangement will not be appropriate if there are exceptional difficulties in the relationship between the parents, or between the parents and their children, which could undermine the arrangement.


The Registrar will examine the case file for objective indicators of any exceptional difficulties in the relationship between the parents, or between the parents and their children.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 38B Decision by Registrar based on payment record and other factors


## Exceptional difficulties


Exceptional difficulties could be of a long-term enduring nature (for example, domestic violence) or of a more temporary nature (for example, litigation). Where one parent is reluctant to make private collect work, this will not generally be an exceptional difficulty.


Exceptional circumstances may include, but are not limited to the following:


### Family violence


Private collect is not appropriate in cases where there is a history of family violence (1.4.1). It may generally be inappropriate to require a person who has previously been exempted from having to take reasonable maintenance action to collect privately.


### Illness


Private collect is not appropriate where a parent's physical or mental illness makes it unlikely that private collect would be sustainable.


### Supervised contact


Private collect is not appropriate where the payer has 'supervised contact' with a child of the relationship.


### Current or pending litigation


Litigation between the parents may indicate private collect is not appropriate. It is irrelevant whether the litigation is about child support issues or an unrelated matter. Litigation can be a cause of stress or concern which may make moving to, or sustaining, private collect more difficult.


### History of disputes


A history of disputes between the parents documented on Services Australia's records (for example, ongoing disputes about payments or care arrangements) may indicate that private collect would not be appropriate.

# 7.4.2 Paying child support - paying Services Australia directly


## Context


The Registrar is required to collect deductible liabilities (1.1.D.10) by deductions from a payer's (1.1.P.40) wage or salary if it is practicable to do so (7.4.3). However, the Registrar can accept a payer's election to make payments directly if the Registrar is satisfied the payments will be made on time.


If a payer who is an employee does not make an election to pay Services Australia directly, the Registrar will collect the payments by employer withholding (1.1.E.20), unless this would not be an efficient method of collection.


## On this page

• Payments made directly to Services Australia
• An election for employer withholding not to apply
• Determining if the payer will make timely payments
• Determining whether to revoke an election

## Payments made directly to Services Australia


A payer can elect to make payments directly to Services Australia. If the Registrar is satisfied that timely payments will be made, the particulars of the Child Support Register can be varied to include a statement that employer withholding does not apply. The Registrar can revoke the payer's election if the payer does not make their payments on time.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 43 General rule of collection by automatic withholding in case of employees, section 44 Cases in which employer withholding not applicable


Policy reference:CS Guide7.4.3Paying child support - employer withholding


## An election for employer withholding not to apply


The Registrar is required to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth under, or in relation, to a deductible liability from the salary or wages of a payer of an enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30), if it is practicable to do so. This does not apply if a payer elects that employer withholding should not apply, and the Registrar accepts the election because the Registrar is satisfied the payer is likely to make timely payments.


For existing payers the Registrar does this by varying the Register to contain a statement that employer withholding does not apply. For new cases, the Registrar includes a statement in the Register at the time the registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) is registered.


If the Registrar accepts the payer's election, the payer should make payments directly to Services Australia rather than payments being deducted from the payer's salary or wages.


If the Registrar refuses a payer's election, the payer may not make a further election for another 2 months.If the Registrar revoked an earlier election because the payer did not pay on time, the payer cannot make another election for 6 months.


If a payer who pays more than one person makes an election, that election will apply to all the liabilities, unless the payer specifies otherwise. Where a payer makes an election which does not apply to all their liabilities, the Registrar will still consider whether the payer is likely to make timely payments for all their liabilities. Thus, the Registrar will take into account the payer's payment pattern in relation to all their existing liabilities when deciding whether the payer is likely to make timely payments for a new liability, in which the first payment is not yet due.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 43 General rule of collection by automatic withholding in case of employees, section 44 Cases in which employer withholding not applicable


Policy reference:CS Guide7.4.3Paying child support - employer withholding


## Determining if payer will make timely payments


If the Registrar is satisfied the payer is likely to make timely payments under the enforceable maintenance liability, the Registrar must accept the payer's election to pay Services Australia directly. To determine whether a payer is likely to make timely payments under the enforceable maintenance liability, payers can be divided into 5 groups:

• First election by new payers before any payments due
• First election by payers, other than new payers, who do not have arrears (1.1.A.100)
• First election by payers, other than new payers, who have arrears
• Subsequent election where previous election revoked because the payer did not make timely payments
• Subsequent election where the Registrar rejected the previous election

### First election by new payers before any payments due

• are a payer of child support (1.1.C.60) for the first time
• are not yet due to make the first payment, and
• have not previously made an election.

Whenever possible, Services Australia discusses payment options with a prospective payer before registration. If a payer elects for withholding not to apply, the election will often be made before any payment is due. There is no payment pattern which might help indicate whether the payer is likely to make timely payments.


In the absence of a payment pattern, the Registrar will determine whether the payer is likely to make timely payments on the basis of the preliminary discussions or correspondence with the payer. The Registrar will be satisfied that the payer is likely to make timely payments, except where the payer has expressly indicated an intention to avoid paying as required.


A payer may claim that they cannot make the entire first payment on time because it includes amounts for a period prior to them knowing of the enforceable maintenance liability (known as 'start-up arrears'). The Registrar will be satisfied that the payer is likely to make timely payments even if it is unlikely that all the first payment will be paid on time, provided that the payer:

• did not expressly indicate an intention to avoid paying as required
• made a reasonable proposal for paying off the start-up arrears which the Registrar has accepted, and
• undertook to pay the normal monthly amount (that is, the monthly amount after excluding start-up arrears) when it falls due.

When there are no start-up arrears or minimal amounts owed, the payer may still claim that he or she will not be able to make all the first payment on time because notice of the enforceable maintenance liability did not allow sufficient time for the arrangement of their financial affairs. The Registrar will be satisfied that a payer who makes this claim is likely to make timely payments even if it is unlikely that all the first payment will be paid on time, provided that the payer:

• had less than 21 days notice of the first payment
• did not expressly indicate an intention to avoid paying as required, and
• undertook to make the first payment as soon as possible after the due date, but no later than the due date for the second payment.

### First election by payers, other than new payers, who do not have arrears


Includes payers, whether or not already linked to employer withholding, who:

• have not previously made an election
• were due to start making payments by a date which has already passed, either for this liability or for any other current or previous liability, and
• do not have any arrears.

The Registrar will be satisfied that a payer who does not have arrears is likely to make timely payments, unless the payer has expressly indicated an intention to avoid paying as required.


Example:The Registrar will not be satisfied that payments are likely to be timely if collection of arrears has been enforced through either employer withholding, a tax refund intercept (1.1.T.40), or from a third party.


The Registrar will normally take into account the payer's payment pattern in relation to any previous enforceable maintenance liability, whether or not the payee (1.1.P.30) of that liability is the payee of the current liability. The extent to which this will be a factor in determining whether the payer is likely to make timely payments will depend on:

• how long ago the previous liability ceased
• the reasons for any arrears which may have arisen in relation to the previous liability
• whether the reasons for any arrears in relation to the previous liability indicate that the payer may again not make timely payments
• any circumstances in relation to the previous liability which distinguish it from the current liability.

### First election by payers (other than new payers) who have arrears


Includes payers, whether or not already linked to employer withholding, who:

• have not previously made an election
• were due to start making payments by a date which has already occurred, either for this enforceable maintenance liability or any other current or previous liability, and
• have arrears.

The Registrar will be satisfied that a payer who has arrears is nevertheless likely to make timely payments, if the payer:

• made a reasonable proposal for paying off the arrears and the payer is keeping to the agreed arrangement, and
• is paying the normal monthly amount (that is, the monthly amount after excluding arrears) when each falls due.

### Subsequent election where previous election revoked because payer did not make timely payments

• previously made an election but did not make timely payments
• had the election revoked because the Registrar was not satisfied that timely payments were likely to resume in the near future, and
• made another election, after waiting the required 6 months.

If a payer again elects for employer withholding not to apply, the Registrar will not give effect to the payer's subsequent election unless the payer can demonstrate that the circumstances that led to the previous election being revoked no longer exist.


In considering a subsequent election, the Registrar will require more substantial indicators that payments will be timely than were required when deciding whether to allow the previous election. The kinds of more substantial indicators include:

• the payer offers to be permanently in advance by at least one month's payment
• the monthly liability has reduced because of a court order orCOA(1.1.C.50) decision made after collection resumed, and the Registrar is satisfied the payer had in fact been making a genuine effort to pay, and that they will be likely to make the new monthly payments in full and on time.

### Subsequent election where the Registrar rejected the previous election


The Registrar will consider subsequent elections by payers whose previous election was rejected using the same tests that apply to first elections.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 43 General rule of collection by automatic withholding in case of employees, section 44 Cases in which employer withholding not applicable


Policy reference:CS Guide7.4.3Paying child support - employer withholding


## Determining whether to revoke an election


### Payer does not make timely payments


If a payer does not make timely payments under the enforceable maintenance liability or any other deductible liability, the election will be revoked, unless the Registrar is satisfied that:

• the payer is likely to resume making timely payments under the enforceable maintenance liability or the deductible liability in the near future, or
• employer withholding is not an efficient method of collecting payments due under the enforceable liability or the deductible liability.

In considering whether the payer is likely to resume making timely payments, the Registrar will first determine whether one of the following special circumstances caused the payer not to pay on time:

• the circumstances causing the failure to make timely payments were beyond the payer's control, andthe circumstances existed for the one month only, orif the circumstances will continue beyond the one month, the payer has taken reasonable action to minimise their effect in the future
• the circumstances existed for the one month only, or
• if the circumstances will continue beyond the one month, the payer has taken reasonable action to minimise their effect in the future
• the payer advised that an unexpected temporary drop in income or an urgent and necessary expense caused the late payment, but for the one month only
• the amount payable for a particular month is abnormally high because it includes additional amounts for previous months caused by a retrospective variation to the liability, and the payer cannot afford to pay the additional amount by the due date.

If any of these special circumstances apply, the Registrar will then require the payer to have:

• made a reasonable proposal for paying off the arrears which has been accepted
• undertaken to pay the normal monthly amount (that is, the monthly amount after excluding arrears) when each falls due, and
• established a payment pattern which indicates that, under normal circumstances, they will make timely payments

before being satisfied that the payer is likely to resume making timely payments in the near future.


The election will be revoked if the Registrar is not satisfied that the payer is likely to resume making timely payments in the near future.


### Payer has not kept to an arrangement to pay off arrears


Where a payer does not keep to an arrangement to pay off arrears, the Registrar will consider whether to revoke their election. The Registrar will use the same tests that apply when it considers whether to revoke an election where a payer does not make timely payments (see above).


The payer's failure to keep to the payment arrangement indicates that the special circumstances that led to the arrears in the first place will continue to have an effect. The Registrar will require the payer to demonstrate that this is not the case.


### Payers who make an election but subsequently do not make timely payments


If a payer does not make timely payments under the enforceable maintenance liability, or any other deductible liability, the Registrar must vary the Register entry so that employer withholding applies (unless the Registrar is satisfied that:

• deduction from salary or wages would not be an efficient method of collection, or
• the payer is likely to resume making timely payments in the near future.

If the Registrar revokes a payer's election because the payer did not make timely payments, that payer cannot make another election for 6 months from the date the election is revoked.

# 7.4.3.10 Employer withholding - paying from salary or wages


## Context


The Registrar is required to collect amounts due to the Commonwealth in relation to deductible liabilities (1.1.D.10) by making deductions from the salary or wages of a payer (1.1.P.40) of an enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30) (known as employer withholding (1.1.E.20)), as far as practicable.


When employer withholding is in place, protected earnings (1.1.P.120) is the amount of income an employer is required to leave a payer with after they have deducted child support (1.1.C.60) from their salary or wage.


## On this page

• When does employer withholding apply?
• Salary and wages
• Starting employer withholding
• Collecting arrears through employer withholding

## When does employer withholding apply?


The Registrar must, as far as practicable, use employer withholding to collect a deductible liability. A deductible liability is any of the following liabilities that are due by the payer to the Commonwealth:

• an enforceable maintenance liability
• a liability to pay a child support debt (1.1.C.90) (8.3)
• a liability to pay a child support related debt (1.1.C.160) (8.3.1)
• a carer liability (8.1.1).

Employer withholding may not be a practicable method of collection where, for example, deductions could not be made in full due to the protected earnings (1.1.P.120) amount and the payer has agreed to pay via another method.


A payer may elect to make voluntary payments directly to Services Australia and the Registrar may accept this election (7.4.2). If this election is accepted, employer withholding will not be used to collect the payer's liability.

## Salary & wages


The definition of salary or wages has a broad meaning under the CSRC Act and includes:

• payments to employees
• payments to company directors
• payments to office holders
• return to work payments
• payments under labour hire arrangements
• payments of pensions and annuities
• payments for termination of employment
• payments for unused leave
• benefit payments
• compensation payments
• alienated personal services payments
• payments to independent contractors
• parental leave payments, and
• periodic payments received from a superannuation fund (including payments made under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Scheme and the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme).

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 4 Interpretation


PPLActsection 69 Deductions relating to child support


## Starting employer withholding


The Registrar will send a written notice to the payer's employer when a decision is made to collect a deductible liability through employer withholding. The notice will:

• specify the name of the payer
• include sufficient particulars to enable the employer to identify the payer
• instruct the employer tomake periodic deductions from salary and wages paid to the payer, from a specified day in accordance with the specified weekly deduction ratepay to the Registrar the amounts deducted each month by the seventh day of the following month, andgive the Registrar notice of the amounts deducted, unless the employer reports deductions using single touch payroll to the Commissioner of Taxation.
• make periodic deductions from salary and wages paid to the payer, from a specified day in accordance with the specified weekly deduction rate
• pay to the Registrar the amounts deducted each month by the seventh day of the following month, and
• give the Registrar notice of the amounts deducted, unless the employer reports deductions using single touch payroll to the Commissioner of Taxation.

The weekly deduction rate means:

• for an enforceable maintenance liability - the weekly rate of payment specified in the particulars of the entry in the Register (1.2.1.10) in relation to the liability, or
• for any other deductible liability - the weekly rate of payment specified in the notice given in relation to the liability.

The Registrar must give a copy of the notice to the payer.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 45 Notification to be given to employer and employee, section 46 Duty of employer to make deductions from salary or wages, section 47 Additional duties of employers


## Collecting arrears through employer withholding


The Registrar can collect arrears (1.1.A.100) through employer withholding (this is known as employer withholding of arrears). Amounts overdue include debts owed to the Commonwealth that arise under or in relation to a deductible liability. This may include arrears of child support (1.1.C.60), a carer debt,LPPs (1.1.L.20) (8.2) and estimate penalties (3.4.4).


The Registrar can issue a notice to an employer for the collection of overdue amounts or, vary a notice already served on an employer to include an additional amount to cover arrears in addition to the deductions for the ongoing deductible liabilities. A copy of the notice to increase the deduction must be served on the employer. The Registrar will also send a copy of the notice to the payer.


As in all payment arrangements, Services Australia will provide a payer with the opportunity to respond before additional deductions commence. An opportunity to negotiate allows the payer to present Services Australia with any relevant facts for consideration. The protected earnings amount still applies in these cases.


An arrangement to collect arrears by employer withholding will not prevent the Registrar from taking other administrative action or legal action to recover the debt. Services Australia will make this clear to a payer when negotiating any recovery arrangement.


Example:The Registrar is collecting Blair's arrears of child support by additional salary deductions. The Registrar becomes aware that Blair is about to sell a property in which they have significant equity. The Registrar would seek to satisfy the debt in full by reaching an agreement with Blair to pay their arrears at the time of settlement, or by issuing a section 72A notice (8.3.2). It is important to make clear to Blair that the Registrar will seek to satisfy the debt in the most efficient and timely way possible. If an additional amount becomes available, the Registrar will seek to apply it to the debt.

The Registrar may give written notice to an employer to deduct a specified amount from the wages or salary paid to an employee or contractor who is a payer (1.1.P.40) of a deductible liability (1.1.D.10).


Employers are obliged to withhold money from salary and wages and to send it to the Registrar.


Employers are also required to report to the Registrar on information about the deductions they make from their employees' pay for child support (1.1.C.60) purposes. However, employers who voluntarily report their employees' child support deduction information to the Commissioner of Taxation undersingle touch payrollreporting, are not required to report those amounts to the Registrar (11.6.1).


Employers are also obliged not to prejudice employees, not to disclose information, to keep records and to allow access.


### Employers not to prejudice employees


It is an offence for an employer to:

• refuse to pay or employ a person
• dismiss, or threaten to dismiss, a person
• terminate, or threaten to terminate, a person's employment
• prejudice, or threaten to prejudice, a person in their employment, or
• intimidate, coerce or penalise, a person

because the person is the payer of a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) (includes liabilities which could be registered under the CSRC Act), or any other deductible liability, or is an employee in relation to whom a notice has been given to an employer under CSRC Act section 45(1).


An offence under CSRC Act section 57 is treated very seriously as payers or potential payers of a registrable maintenance liability or any other deductible liability may be subject to prejudice. Allegations of prejudice will be investigated as a matter of high priority. See11.6.1for more information on employer offences.


### Employer not to disclose information


An employer (or their employee or contractor) has a duty not to disclose (either directly or indirectly) any information obtained in accordance with the employer's duties under CSRC Act Part IV, unless the information is divulged for the purposes of complying with their obligations to deduct and remit those deductions to the Registrar or in connection with carrying on the employer's affairs (CSRC Act section 58).


A breach of this duty is an offence and is treated seriously as it involves parents' privacy. See11.6.1for more information on employer offences.


### Keeping records


An employer is obliged to keep records either written in English or readily convertible into English that explain all amounts deducted, or required to be deducted, under CSRC Act section 46 as well as any other acts required under CSRC Act Part IV (CSRC Act section 59). The employer must keep these records for 5 years unless the Registrar advises the employer otherwise, or the employer is a company which has gone into liquidation and has been dissolved.


See11.6.1for more information on offences for failing to keep records and incorrectly keeping records.


### Allowing access


An employer is obliged to provide authorised Services Australia officers with free access to premises and documents at reasonable times so that the officer can inspect, examine, make copies of, or take extracts of, any document for the purposes of Part IV (CSRC Act section 61). The occupier of the premises must provide the officer with all reasonable facilities and assistance that the occupier is reasonably capable of providing.


Services Australia officers must produce an authority in writing, if requested, stating that they are authorised to exercise powers under section 61 (see11.2.5for more information on access to employer records).


An employer who refuses access or does not provide reasonable facilities or assistance is guilty of an offence. See11.6.1for more information on employer offences.


## Public officer service on a company or trust


An employer, which is a company or trust, is required by theIncome Tax Assessment Act 1936to have a public officer for the purposes of that Act. A public officer for tax purposes is also a public officer for the purposes of the CSRC Act (CSRC Act section 62 and section 63). Service on the public officer at the address for service is sufficient service on the company or trust for the purposes of the CSRC Act. Proceedings against the public officer are deemed to be proceedings against the company or trust.


## Penalties


The CSRC Act imposes administrative penalties on employers for failing to pay amounts deducted to the Registrar, failing to deduct from an employee's salary or wage, and unexplained remittances. Alternatively, the Registrar may take action in court to prosecute employers for breaching such duties and other duties (CSRC Act section 56) (see11.6.1and11.6.7for more information).


### Failing to pay deducted amounts to the Registrar


Where an employer (apart from the Commonwealth) owes an amount under CSRC Act section 47 and the amount is not paid by the due date, the employer is liable to pay a penalty in addition to the amount owed (CSRC Act section 51).


The penalty applied is 20% of the amount and 20% per annum of the original amount and penalty that remains unpaid. Where the employer is a government body, a penalty of 20% per annum on the amount that is unpaid is applied (CSRC Act section 51(b)).


### Failing to deduct from an employee's salary or wages


Where an employer (apart from the Commonwealth) fails or refuses to make deductions from the salary or wages of employees as required under CSRC Act section 46(1) the employer is liable to pay a penalty of 20% per annum of the amount that should have been paid. An employer, other than a government body, is also liable to pay an amount equal to the undeducted amount (CSRC Act section 52).


### Unexplained remittances


When an employer remits deductions to the Registrar, they must notify the Registrar of the details of the deductions, unless the employer is voluntarily reporting these details to the Commissioner of Taxation (see Employer obligations). If the employer remits less than the total expected amount to the Registrar and they are required to deduct amounts for more than one payer, the Registrar will transfer an amount from consolidated revenue to 'top up' the shortfall (CSRC Act section 78(3)(d)). The employer is liable to pay a penalty of an amount equal to the 'top up' amount (CSRC Act section 53).


## Remission of penalties


The Registrar can remit penalties imposed for the late payment of deductions or the failure to make deductions or the failure to explain a shortfall in remittances (CSRC Act section 54). Remission of penalties involves consideration of:

• the circumstances that led to the employer's delay in payment or failure to make the deduction
• the employer's action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances, and
• special circumstances in which it would be fair and reasonable to remit the penalty.

If the Registrar makes a decision to remit only part of a penalty, or not to remit any part of a penalty, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision to the person who is liable to pay the penalty (CSRC Act section 54(3)). The notice must also include, or be accompanied by, a statement that the person can object to the decision (10.2.3) (CSRC Act paragraph 54(4)(a) and section 80) and apply forARTreview (10.3.3) of the objection decision if dissatisfied with that decision (CSRC Act paragraph 54(4)(b) and section 89).


### Circumstances that led to the delay or failure - beyond the control of the employer


The employer must demonstrate that they could not make adequate provision to deduct a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) or to remit the amount to the Registrar by the due date because of unpredictable factors beyond their control.

• Sudden ill health of key personnel in a small business.
• Industrial action.
• Unforeseen collapse of a major debtor.
• Disruption caused by natural disasters such as bushfires, floods, droughts or hailstorms.
• Exceptional circumstances which lead to a temporary reduction in the employer's cash flow.
• 'Adverse business conditions affecting the industry', 'general economic downturn', or 'fluctuation of currency rates' will not be sufficient unless the employer can show a more specific event or effect on cash flow.

An employer must also demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to mitigate the circumstances that contributed to the failure to deduct or the late payment.

• A budget reorganisation to counteract the reduction in cash flow.
• Attempts to raise additional funds from financial institutions.
• Application for government assistance for disaster relief.
• Action by the employer to protect their position where money is owed to them.

It will not be sufficient for an employer to claim that they did not understand the requirement to deduct. Employers are routinely required to make certain deductions from the salary and wages of their employees. However, the Registrar will give the benefit of the doubt to an employer who claims not to have understood their obligation to notify a variation to an expected deduction on the first occasion and will remit the penalty.


Circumstances that led to the delay or failure - within the control of the employer.


The employer must demonstrate that they could not make adequate provision to deduct a periodic amount or to remit the amount to the Registrar by the due date because of exceptional circumstances within their control.

• A bad business decision (although reasonable at the time it was made) resulted in a direct financial loss or adverse and unforeseen consequences.
• An employer's payment history may also be considered as an indication of the degree of control that the employer has over events and attempts made to plan around these events.

If the Registrar is satisfied that the circumstances were exceptional, and the employer demonstrates that it has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of those circumstances, the Registrar will remit the penalty in full.


### Steps taken to mitigate the effects


Example:Where the inability to pay is caused by the collapse of a major debtor, the penalties may be remitted where the employer can demonstrate that necessary action has been taken to secure the debt.


### Special circumstances in which it would be fair & reasonable to remit the penalty


The Registrar may be satisfied that there are special circumstances where it would be fair and reasonable to remit the penalty. These would normally be limited to cases of serious financial hardship or where the employer is deceased.


## Employer obligations when more than one notice received


If an employer receives a notice from the Registrar and a statutory notice from another Commonwealth, state or territory authority, both instructing the employer to deduct from an employee's wage or contractor's payments, the general rule is that notices are complied with in the order they were received by the employer. Employer withholding notices to deduct amounts in relation to a deductible liability can be processed after any notices received earlier have been actioned by the employer. If a statutory notice issued to the employer is later varied, for example, by instructing the employer to deduct a different amount, the priority given to each notice will not change.


If an employer receives a notice from the Registrar and a Commonwealth, state or territory court order, both instructing the employer to deduct from an employee's wage or contractor's payments, the notice from the Registrar will take priority over the court order regardless of the order in which the employer receives the garnishee (1.1.G.10) order or notice.


Employers should contact Services Australia to get advice specific to an employee or contractor's situation if they are unsure of their obligations in relation to multiple garnishee notices.

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 7.4.3.30 Top up


## Context


The CSRC Act allows the Registrar (1.2.1.10) to use funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to 'top up' the amounts received from employers in limited circumstances.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 4, section 45, section 47, section 77, section 78


## Description


Where Services Australia is collecting child support (1.1.C.60) through employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3), the Registrar sends the employer a notice under CSRC Act section 45(1) that instructs them to:

• make periodic deductions from salary and wages paid to the payer (1.1.P 40), from a specified day in accordance with the specified weekly deduction rate
• pay the Registrar the amounts deducted each month by the seventh day of the following month, and
• give the Registrar notice of the amounts deducted (section 47(1)) (7.4.3.10).

If the Registrar is satisfied that an employer has deducted the required amounts from a payer's salary or wages, but has failed to pay them to the Registrar on time, the Registrar can transfer equivalent amounts from consolidated revenue (the Account (section 4) (1.2.1.20)) for payment to the payee (1.1.P.30). The Registrar must do this if the deduction has not been received by the closing day of the month in which the employer was required to pay the amount. The closing day for any month is 9 days before the first Wednesday of the following month (section 4(1)).


The Registrar can also transfer funds from consolidated revenue to the Account for payment to a payee when:

• an employer remits less than the total expected amount to the Registrar and they are required to deduct amounts for more than one payer, and
• the employer has not advised the Registrar of the particulars of the payment (section 78).

The transfer of funds to the Account in these circumstances is commonly referred to as top up.


The Registrar must recover any amounts transferred from consolidated revenue for top up. The debt is recoverable from the employer if they deducted the amount from the payer's salary or wages, but failed to remit it to the Registrar. If the employer did not deduct the amount from the payer's salary, the payer is still obliged to pay that amount in child support to the Registrar and the Registrar will recover the top up debt from those payments when made.

# 7.4.4.10 Payment from social security pensions & benefits


## Context


Where a payer (1.1.P.40) has an ongoing liability under a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and is receiving a pension or benefit, the Registrar can collect child support (1.1.C.60) payments from that pension or benefit.

## What is a 'social security pension or benefit'?


Social security benefit and social security pension include the following payments.


The Secretary cannot deduct amounts from a child support debtor's or carer debtor's pension or benefit from payments that are not listed above. However, payments fromABSTUDY(8.3.2) may be collected by other means.


Act references:CSRC Actsection 72AA Deductions from social security pensions and benefits

Farm Household Support Act 2014section 91 Purposes of this Part, section 93 Application of the Social Security Act


Policy references:ABSTUDY Policy Manual


CS Guide8.3.2Collection from third parties


## When can deductions be made from pensions & benefits?


If a person is complying with a satisfactory payment arrangement, the Registrar will not collect from their pension or benefit.


Deductions can be made in the following circumstances:

• payers with an ongoing liability arising under a child support assessment
• debtors with child support or child maintenance arrears arising under the CSA Act, a child maintenance order or an overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (that is, amounts that were not paid when they fell due and payable)
• debtors with arrears (1.1.A.100) of spousal maintenance under an overseas maintenance liability
• debtors with a carer debt (1.1.C.30) (8.1.1), and

people who have an outstanding debt under a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) that is registered for collection by the Registrar.


Deductions cannot be used to collect:

• outstanding penalty amounts, and
• spousal maintenance arising under Australian law.

A person may contact Services Australia at any time to discuss their individual financial circumstances. The Registrar will not defer collection of the ongoing liability. However, if a person is experiencing difficulties meeting their necessary expenses, the Registrar may defer or reduce the amount being deducted for collection of arrears or carer debts. Necessary expenses include, but are not limited to, accommodation, food, clothing, medical and utilities, for the payer and any children in their care.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 4 Interpretation, section 30 Effect of registration, section 72AA Deductions from social security pensions and benefits


Policy reference:CS Guide8.1.1Overpayments,8.4.7Recovery orders


## How much can be deducted?


Where there is an ongoing child support assessment but no child support arrears, the 'prescribed periodic deduction' is the lesser of either 3 times the minimum social security rate or the liability amount for the instalment period.


The minimum social security rate is calculated using theMAR(1.1.M.20) of child support (2.3.4) and the instalment period of the person's social security pension or benefit.


Example:Mario is assessed to pay $30 per week child support under an agreement and has no child support arrears. Mario is now in receipt of JSP. The Registrar can deduct 3 times the minimum social security rate as this is less than the ongoing liability amount.


Where child support or maintenance arrears exist, the 'prescribed periodic deduction' is the lesser of either 3 times the minimum social security rate (less any amounts deducted for the ongoing liability) or the amount of the debt that has not been paid.


Example:Yang is assessed to pay $10 per week child support and has arrears of $60. Yang is in receipt of JSP. The Registrar can deduct 3 times the minimum social security rate as this is less than the amount of child support outstanding. $10 is deducted for the ongoing liability, and the balance goes to the arrears.


The Registrar will not collect amounts of less than $1 per week from a person's pension or benefit. If a payer's child support liability is less than $1 per week and there are no arrears, the amounts due will be allowed to accumulate until the Registrar can instruct the Secretary to deduct an amount.


Where a carer debt exists, the Registrar will determine an amount to be deducted. The Registrar may determine an amount that reduces a person's social security pension or benefit to nil, if the person has consented to the amount of the deduction being an amount that would reduce their social security pension or benefit to nil.

CSRC Actsection 72AA(2) Deductions from social security pensions and benefits


CSRC Regssection 20 Prescribed periodic deduction


Policy reference:CS Guide2.3.4Minimum annual rate


## Payers with an ongoing liability under a child support assessment


Where a payer has an ongoing liability under a child support assessment and is receiving a pension or benefit, the Registrar can collect child support payments from that pension or benefit. The Registrar will commence deductions from a payer's pension or benefit if they have an ongoing liability, and arrears and/or a poor compliance history.


## Debtors with child support or maintenance arrears


Where a debtor is in arrears and is receiving a social security pension or benefit, the Registrar can notify the Secretary to deduct amounts from that pension or benefit until the debt is paid in the following circumstances:

• an ongoing assessment with child support outstanding
• child support arrears relating to an assessment which is no longer continuing
• arrears of child or spousal maintenance arising under an overseas maintenance liability
• a court-ordered liability with amounts of child maintenance outstanding, and
• an outstanding amount payable under a recovery order registered for collection by the Registrar.

If a debtor's court-ordered maintenance liability has been suspended during a low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4), the Registrar can continue to collect arrears from that debtor's pension or benefit that arose before commencement of the low-income non-enforcement period.


Debts to consolidated revenue that are still debts due to the Commonwealth can also be recovered from social security pensions or benefits.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 30 Effect of registration


Policy reference:CS Guide9.2.4Suspension for unemployment (low-income non-enforcement period)


## Debtors with a carer debt


Where a debtor owes a carer debt and is receiving a social security pension or benefit, and the debtor has ceased paying amounts to the Registrar or has not entered into a satisfactory payment arrangement with the Registrar, the Registrar can notify the Secretary to deduct amounts from that pension or benefit until the debt is paid.


## Collection from other sources


Collection from a person's social security pension or benefit does not preclude the Registrar from collecting from other sources including applying any tax refund (8.3.1) that may become available to the person's outstanding child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt.


## Issuing a notice


The Registrar can give written notice to the Secretary to deduct amounts from a child support debtor's or carer debtor's pension or benefit in order to collect that person's child support debt or carer debt. The SS(Admin)Act enables the Secretary to comply with the notice and forward the amounts to the Registrar.


The Registrar commences deductions from a person's pension or benefit by giving the Secretary a written notice specifying:

• the person's name
• sufficient detail to enable the Secretary to identify the person

and instructing the Secretary

• for liabilities arising under a child support assessment, to make the prescribed periodic deduction from that payer's social security pension or benefit from a specified day
• for outstanding child support debts, to make the prescribed periodic deduction from the person's social security pension or benefit from a specified day, or
• for carer liabilities, to deduct an amount, determined by the Registrar, from the payer's social security pension or benefit from a specified day.

The Registrar can issue the notice electronically or by any other means. The Registrar is not required to provide the payer with a copy of the notice.

# 7.4.4.20 Payment from FTB


## Context


The Registrar can give written notice to Centrelink to make deductions fromFTBpayable to a person for a child, and apply the deducted amounts to child support debts (1.1.C.90) or carer debts (1.1.C.30) that the person owes.


## Overview


If a person has child support debts or a carer debt in relation to a child for whom they will receive FTB, the Registrar can give notice to Centrelink requiring deductions from the person's FTB entitlement. This may reduce the person's FTB entitlement to nil. Any amounts deducted from the person's FTB entitlement are sent to the Registrar and applied to the person's child support debt or carer debt.


Centrelink can only make deductions from the portion of the person's FTB entitlement that relates to a child or children for whom the person owes a child support debt or carer debt.


Example:Robbie receives FTB for Freya who has recently come into his full-time care. Robbie owes child support arrears (1.1.A.100) from when he was assessed to pay child support (1.1.C.60) for Freya. The Registrar can make deductions from Robbie’s FTB to pay the child support owed for Freya.


Centrelink will not deduct any amounts from the FTB payable to a person to recover child support debts, child support related debts (1.1.C.160), or carer debts of the following type:

• spousal maintenance
• overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40)
• an amount repayable by a former payee (1.1.P.30) under a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) that is registered for collection by the Registrar
• carer debts as a result of payments under a registered maintenance liability for spousal maintenance, an overseas maintenance liability and amounts repayable under a recovery order
• estimate orLPPs (1.1.L.20), or
• fines or costs ordered by a court.

Before the Registrar can issue a notice requiring Centrelink to make deductions from the person's FTB to recover a child support debt or a carer debt, the due date for payment must have passed and there must be amounts overdue. A notice can have an ongoing effect on periodic FTB entitlements until the debt is fully recovered or the notice is withdrawn.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 17A Liabilities in relation to persons who have paid amounts where no liability to pay because the person is not the parent, section 18 Liabilities in relation to parties to marriages, or parties to de facto relationships, that are registrable maintenance liabilities, section 18A Liability in relation to registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


CSA Actsection 143 Amounts paid where no liability to pay exists


FA(Admin)Actsection 228 Maximum deduction


Policy reference:CS Guide8.4.7Recovery orders


FA Guide7.4Child support debts


## Where a payment arrangement is in place


Where a payment arrangement is already in place to recover the child support debt or carer debt and the person is complying with that arrangement, the Registrar will not collect the debt from the person's FTB payments.


## Collection from other sources


Collection from a person's FTB entitlement does not preclude the Registrar from collecting from other sources including applying any tax refund that may become available to the person's outstanding child support debt or carer debt.


## Issuing a notice


The Registrar commences deductions from a person's FTB payments by giving written notice to Centrelink, specifying:

• the person's name
• the name of each child for whom a child support debt or a carer debt is owed
• sufficient details to allow Centrelink to identify the person and each child
• the amount of the child support debt or carer debt being recovered, and
• the day or days on which deductions are to be made.

The Registrar will notify the person that collection action has commenced. The decision to issue a notice to Centrelink to make deductions from FTB is an appealable refusal decision (10.2.3).

# 7.4.4.40 Payment from parental leave payment


## Context


The Registrar can collect a payer's (1.1.P.40) child support (1.1.C.60) and spousal maintenance payments by making deductions fromPLPpayable to that person. The Registrar can also collect a carer debt (1.1.C.30) or child support debt (1.1.C.90) by making deductions from PLP payable to that person.


More information on PLP is available in thePaid Parental Leave Guide.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 30, section 69B, section 72AD


## Overview


The Registrar can give written notice to Centrelink to deduct an amount from a parent's PLP to collect the parent's enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30), child support debt or carer liability (CSRC Act section 72AD).


If payments are paid by the employer, the Registrar can collect by applying employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3), or by issuing a section 72A notice (8.3.2) if employer withholding is not appropriate. Centrelink will comply with the notice and forward the amounts to the Registrar (PPL Act section 69).


## When can deductions be made from PLP?


Deductions from PLP can be made from (CSRC Act section 72AD):

• payers of an enforceable maintenance liability (7.4.1.20)
• payers of child support debts that were not paid when they fell due and payable, or
• payers of a carer debt (overpayment (1.1.O.20)) (8.1.1).

Deductions from PLP cannot be used to collect (CSRC Act section 72AD):

• LPPs (1.1.L.20) (8.2), or
• estimate penalties (3.4.5).

## Issuing the Notice


To initiate making deductions from a payer's PLP, the Registrar must issue a written notice to the Chief Executive Officer of Services Australia, specifying:

• the payer's name
• sufficient detail to enable Centrelink to identify the person, and
• instructions to make fortnightly deductions of a specified amount from a specified day. The specified amount can be for an ongoing liability, an ongoing liability and arrears, or carer debt.

The Registrar is not required to give the payer a copy of the notice.


## How much can be deducted


Centrelink cannot deduct the full specified periodic deduction from a payer's PLP if that would leave the payer with less than the 'protected earnings (1.1.P.120) amount' (CSRC Act section 72AD(3) and (4)).

# 7.4.4.30 Payment from veterans' pensions & allowances


## Context


The Registrar can collect a person's child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt (1.1.C.30) by making deductions from veterans' pensions or allowances payable to that person (CSRC Act section 72AC).


If a person is complying with a satisfactory payment arrangement, the Registrar will not collect from their veteran's pension or allowance.


## Act references


Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986section 45SB, section 58J(3)


## On this page


The Registrar can give written notice to the Repatriation Commission to deduct amounts from a person's pension or allowance in order to collect that person's child support debt or carer debt (CSRC Act section 72AC).


Section 58J(3) of theVeterans' Entitlements Act 1986enables the Repatriation Commission to comply with the notice and forward the amounts to the Registrar.

## What is a 'veteran's pension or allowance'?


The veterans' pension and veterans' allowance payments from which Services Australia may request deductions are specified at section 72AC of the CSRC Act and are:

• an age service pension under Division 3 of Part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act
• an invalidity service pension under Division 4 of Part III of that Act
• a partner service pension under Division 5 of Part III of that Act
• an income support supplement under Part IIIA of that Act, or
• a veteran payment made under an instrument made under section 45SB of that Act.

The Repatriation Commission cannot make deductions under CSRC Act section 72AC from payments that are not listed above.


## When can deductions be made from pensions & allowances?


CSRC Act section 72AC deductions CAN ONLY be made where a person:

• is a payer (1.1.P.40) with an enforceable maintenance liability arising under CSRC Act section 17
• owes a child support debt in relation to a liability under section 17 or 17A of the CSRC Act (that is amounts that were not paid when they fell due and payable)
• has an outstanding debt under a recovery order (8.4.7) that is registered for collection by the Registrar, or
• is a debtor in relation to a carer liability (8.1.1).

Section 72AC deductions CANNOT be made in relation to spousal maintenance liabilities or registrable overseas maintenance liabilities.


## Payers with an ongoing liability arising under the CSA Act


Where a payer has an ongoing liability under a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and is receiving a veteran's pension or allowance, the Registrar can seek to collect child support (1.1.C.60) payments from that pension or allowance.


The Registrar will commence deductions from a payer's pension or allowance if they have an ongoing liability, arrears (1.1.A.100) and/or a poor compliance history.


Services Australia will encourage a payer with no arrears of child support, and a good payment history to consider all their payment options including:

• making private arrangements
• paying Services Australia directly
• having their payments deducted from their veteran's pension or allowance, or
• using employer withholding (1.1.E.20).

Services Australia will inform a payer who elects to make private arrangements or is paying Services Australia directly, that it will take immediate collection action if they fail to comply with those arrangements. If the payer defaults, the Registrar will notify the Repatriation Commission to deduct the ongoing liability from the payer's pension or allowance without prior notification to the payer.


## Persons with child support arrears


Where a person has child support debt and is receiving a veteran's pension or allowance, the Registrar can notify the Repatriation Commission to deduct amounts from that pension or allowance until the debt is paid.


The Registrar can collect arrears arising from:

• a court-ordered liability with child support outstanding
• arrears relating to an assessment which is no longer continuing
• an ongoing liability with child support outstanding, or
• an outstanding amount payable under a recovery order (1.1.R.30) registered for collection by the Registrar.

If a person's court-ordered child maintenance liability has been suspended during a low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4), the Registrar can continue to collect arrears from that person's pension or allowance.


Debts to consolidated revenue which are still debts due to the Commonwealth under CSRC Act section 30 can also be recovered from veterans' pensions or allowances.


## Persons with a carer liability


Where a person has a carer liability and is receiving a veteran's pension or allowance, and the person has ceased paying amounts to the Registrar or has not entered into a satisfactory payment arrangement with the Registrar, the Registrar can notify the Repatriation Commission to deduct amounts from that pension or allowance until the carer debt is paid.


## Contacting the person


Services Australia will contact a person by telephone to advise that the Registrar will start deductions from their pension or allowance. The exception is where the person has elected to make other payment arrangements and was notified that deductions would start if they defaulted on those arrangements.


If Services Australia does not make contact with the person by telephone, the person will be informed in writing that the Repatriation Commission has been notified to commence deductions from their pension or allowance.


## How much can be deducted?


Where there is an ongoing liability but no child support arrears, the 'prescribed periodic deduction' is the lesser of either 3 times the minimum veterans rate or the liability amount for the pension period (CSRC Regs section 21(1)). The minimum veterans rate (2.3.4) is defined in section 21(3) of the CSRC Regs as theMARof child support (CSA Act section 66(5)).


Example:Abdul is assessed to pay $50 per week child support and has no child support arrears. Abdul is in receipt of an age service pension. The Registrar is only entitled to ask the Repatriation Commission to deduct 3 times the minimum veterans rate as this is less than the ongoing liability amount.


Where child support arrears exist, the prescribed periodic deduction is the lesser of either 3 times the minimum veterans rate (less any amounts deducted for the ongoing liability) or the amount of the debt that has not been paid (CSRC Regs section 21(2)).


Example:Madeline is assessed to pay $10 per week child support and has arrears of $60. Madeline is in receipt of an invalidity service pension. The Registrar is only entitled to ask the Repatriation Commission to deduct 3 times the minimum veterans rate (less any amount deducted for the ongoing liability) as this is less than the total outstanding child support. $10 is deducted for the ongoing liability, and the balance goes to the arrears.


The Registrar will not collect amounts of less than $1 per week from a person's veteran's pension or allowance. If a payer's child support liability is less than $1 per week, and there are no arrears, the Registrar will allow the amounts due to accumulate until it can instruct the Repatriation Commission to deduct an amount under section 21(2) of the CSRC Regs.


Where a carer debt exists, the Registrar will determine an amount to be deducted (CSRC Act 72AC(2)(e)). For the purposes of making a determination where a carer debt exists, the Registrar may determine an amount that reduces a person's pension or allowance to nil, if the person has consented to the amount of the deduction being an amount that would reduce the pension or allowance to nil (CSRC Act section 72AC(3)).


The person may contact Services Australia at any time to discuss their individual financial circumstances. The Registrar will not defer collection of the ongoing liability. However, if a person is experiencing difficulties meeting their necessary expenses, the Registrar may defer or reduce the amount being deducted for child support arrears or carer debts. Necessary expenses include but are not limited to accommodation, food, clothing, medical or utilities, for the person and for any children in their care.


## Collection from other sources


Collection from veterans' pensions or allowances does not preclude the Registrar from applying any tax refund (8.3.1) that may become available to a person's outstanding child support or carer debt.


Where Services Australia becomes aware of another source of income, the Registrar will seek to collect the child support liability and arrears, or carer debt, from that source. If employer withholding (7.4.3), employer withholding with arrears and CSRC Act section 72A (8.3.2) are a more appropriate means of collection, those collection methods should be considered. However, a child support related debt or carer debt can only be collected via employer withholding if the person also has an enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30) (7.4.3).


## Issuing a notice


The Registrar commences deductions from a person's pension or allowance by giving the Repatriation Commission a written notice that:

• specifies the person's name
• gives sufficient detail to enable the Repatriation Commission to identify the person

and instructing the Repatriation Commission when any of the following that apply:

• for liabilities under section 17 of the CSRC Act, to make the prescribed periodic deduction from that person's pension or allowance from a specified day (CSRC Act section 72AC(2)(c))
• for liabilities under sections 17 and 17A of the CSRC Act where there is an outstanding debt, to make the prescribed periodic deduction from that person's pension or allowance on the day or days specified (CSRC Act section 72AC(2)(d)), or
• for carer debts, to make a deduction, determined by the Registrar, from the person's pension or allowance from a specified day (CSRC Act section 72AC(2)(e)).

# 7.5.1 Non-agency payments


## Context


In some circumstances, the Registrar may credit payments made directly to a payee (1.1.P.30) or to a third party against a child support liability registered for agency collect (1.1.A.50) or a carer liability (1.1.C.30). The Registrar may also credit the value of non-cash transfers or the provision of services in the same way. These credits are known as 'non-agency payments'.


CSRC Actsection 71, section 71A, section 71B, section 71C, section 71D


## On this page

• What is a non-agency payment?
• Was the payment in respect of an enforceable maintenance liability or carer liability?
• Was a payment made?
• How is a non-cash payment valued?
• Was the payment intended to be in lieu of a child support payment or carer debt?

• Credit against future liabilities
• What happens to a credit if an assessment has ended or the enforceable maintenance liability is no longer payable to the Registrar?
• Discretion to refuse to credit an amount
• Objections
• Other options

## What is a non-agency payment?


A non-agency payment is one of the following types of payment.

• A payment made directly to a payee of an enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30) or to a payee of a carer liability (CSRC Act section 71).
• A payment to a third party in discharge of a debt owed by the payee or payer (1.1.P.40) of the enforceable maintenance liability or carer liability, or both (CSRC Act section 71A).
• A non-cash transaction, such as a transfer of property or the provision of services, taken to be an amount paid under the enforceable maintenance liability or carer liability (CSRC Act section 71B).

The Registrar can credit a non-agency payment to a child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt if, at the time the payment was made, the payer and the payee both intended that it was a payment towards the enforceable maintenance liability or the carer liability, except if the liability is an agency reimbursement liability (1.1.A.60) (CSRC Act sections 71(3), 71A(4)).


The legislation also provides for payments under CSRC Act section 71C if the payment was of a kind specified in section 19 of the CSRC Regs (known as a prescribed payment).


See7.5.2for further information about prescribed non-agency payments.


## Was the payment in respect of an enforceable maintenance liability or carer liability?


The Registrar can only credit payments if the payment was made in respect of an enforceable maintenance liability or a carer liability. This includes non-agency payments made for arrears (1.1.A.100) on ended cases.


Example:Blythe is liable to pay child support (1.1.C.60) to the Registrar from 1 April 2020, which is the date that Trevor applied for collection. On 13 April 2020, Blythe asks the Registrar to credit $200 paid directly to Trevor on 30 March 2020. Blythe and Trevor intended the payment to be for child support for April. The Registrar cannot credit the payment under section 71 of the CSRC Act. At the time of payment, there was no enforceable maintenance liability and the payment was a private payment to the payee.


Example:Morris was liable to pay child support of $200 per month to the Registrar until Petra opted for private collection on 1 May 2020. At that time, Morris had an overdue child support amount of $800, which remained enforceable. On 2 June 2020, Morris asks the Registrar to credit $600 paid directly to Petra on 1 June 2020. Morris and Petra intended the payment to be for child support for the month of May and for overdue child support. At the time of payment, Morris had a liability of $200 for May, which was not enforceable as the liability was raised during the private collect (1.1.P.110) period. The remaining $400 of the payment can be credited against the overdue amount under section 71 of the CSRC Act, as the overdue amount is an enforceable maintenance liability. After the Registrar has credited the $400 against the overdue amount, Morris now has a remaining enforceable maintenance liability of $400.


The Registrar cannot credit a non-agency payment against a liability that is an agency reimbursement liability (1.5.3.20) (CSRC Act sections 71(3) and 71A(4)).


## Was a payment made?


The Registrar can only credit a non-agency payment if the amount has actually been paid or transferred. The Registrar will not credit the value of goods that the payer intends to transfer at a later time, or where the payer has allowed the payee use of those items.


Example:Cosmo, the payer, advises the Registrar that he has given his car to Margit, the payee, and that he wants the value of the car to be credited against his child support liability. Margit advises the Registrar that she agrees to the credit, but mentions that the car is still registered in Cosmo's name because he cannot transfer the ownership while he is paying it off. The Registrar does not credit the value of the car, because Cosmo still owns it. The Registrar suggests that Cosmo and Margit discuss a value for the use of the car and, if they can reach agreement, ask the Registrar to credit this on an ongoing basis.


If a payer and payee disagree about whether a cash payment was made, or on the amount of the payment, the Registrar will ask for evidence of the payment. The Registrar will decide, on the basis of all the evidence, whether or not a payment was made and the value of the amount paid.Acceptable evidence includes bank statements, cheques or receipts. The Registrar will also consider oral or written statements provided by both parents (1.1.P.10).


Example:Jordan, a payer, advises the Registrar that they paid $350 directly to the payee, Flora. When the Registrar asks Flora to confirm the payment, Flora denies receiving it. Jordan then supplies a bank statement, which shows a direct debit from Jordan's account to an account in Flora’s name. The Registrar contacts Flora to discuss this evidence. Flora admits she received the payment, but says she believed it was from another source. The Registrar was satisfied on the basis of the evidence provided that the payment was made, and credits $350 against Jordan’s enforceable maintenance liability.


Example:Alex and Vincent agree that Alex, the payer, will pay $200 per month towards Vincent's monthly loan repayments and that Alex's payment is intended to be payment for child support. Vincent then supplies a bank statement and advises the Registrar that Alex has been regularly redrawing funds of $100 per month from the loan account. The Registrar contacts Alex, who agrees that payments have been withdrawn. The Registrar determines that payments of only $100 per month have been made as non-agency payments.


## How is a non-cash payment valued?


Where parents agree about the value of a non-cash payment (for example, a transfer of property or a service provided), the Registrar will use this agreed value (CSRC Act section 71B(2)(a)).


Where parents cannot agree about a value, the Registrar will decide an amount (CSRC Act section 71B(2)(b)). The Registrar will first try to negotiate an agreed amount with both parents. If this fails, the Registrar will request further information from the parents to determine a value.


Further information could include an independent valuation from a professional valuer (for real estate, etc.), or a letter from a local real estate agent estimating the market value of the property when it was transferred, or a local council valuation. Where the non-cash payment involves the transfer of a motor vehicle, the information sought could include a valuation from a car yard or local garage, or a list of prices showing the approximate value of an equivalent model. The Registrar can seek a receipt for items recently purchased.


## Was the payment intended to be in lieu of a child support payment or carer debt?


The Registrar will accept a parent's advice that a payment received or the value of goods or services provided by the other parent were intended as a payment towards child support or a carer debt.


Where the parents disagree, the Registrar will seek evidence from both parents and decide, on the basis of that evidence, whether the relevant intention existed when the payment was made.


The Registrar will seek oral statements (or written, if either parent cannot be contacted by telephone) from both parents about their intention at the time the payment was made and the circumstances surrounding the payment. Before making a decision, the Registrar will discuss the evidence with both parents, so that they have an opportunity to respond or expand on their statements.


If the Registrar cannot obtain a statement from one of the parents, the Registrar will consider a statement made by the other parent and any other available evidence.


In making a decision, the Registrar will take into account the following factors:

• Whether the parents have agreed that previous payments made in similar circumstances were for child support, as this may indicate the same intention in relation to the present payment.
• The circumstances in which the payment was made. For example, where a payer has made payments or provided goods as part of a contact visit, this may have occurred without the prior knowledge or consent of the payee.
• Any documents that support the case of either parent. For example, if there were legal proceedings in progress at or before the time of the payment, there may be relevant documents which refer to payments made by the payer to the payee or a third party.
• Sometimes the notations on a court order will refer to the payment of expenses. While notations are not part of the court order, they may support the proposition that a parent has agreed that they are separately or jointly responsible for certain payments.
• Whether one of the parents has previously stated that payment was to be credited, but subsequently changed their statement. The Registrar will examine both statements to determine what their intention was at the time the payment was made.

Example:The payer Marta advises of payments of $2,500 for school fees and clothing. Marta claims a credit for that amount under CSRC Act section 71A.


Scenario 1: The payee Toni agrees that the amounts were paid with the intention that they be credited against Marta's child support liability. The Registrar credits the total amount of $2,500.


Scenario 2: Toni states that only an agreed amount of $2,000 was intended to be credited against Marta's child support liability. Toni says that Marta agreed to pay $500 to cover half the cost of school uniforms and that this amount was in addition to Marta's usual child support. Marta is contacted and confirms that arrangement. The Registrar credits an amount of $2,000, a partial credit of the original $2,500 claimed.


Scenario 3: The payee Toni states that the amount should not be credited, as the payments were additional to Marta's ongoing child support liability. Toni claims that there was no agreement or intention on Toni's part that the school fees and clothing would be in lieu of child support payments to the Registrar. Toni later sends in a copy of their property settlement, which included a clause that Marta would pay all school fees and associated costs until their child turns 18 years of age. The amount is not credited. (Note: The Registrar's discretion to refuse to credit this as a prescribed payment under section 71D of the CSRC Act would also be exercised).


Example:The payer Owen asks for payments totalling $300 to be credited. The total is made up of several amounts including a trip to the zoo, computer games and a pair of sports shoes.


The payee Morgan states that the payments were not intended as child support payments and that the child already had a perfectly good pair of sports shoes. Morgan states that there has been no discussion regarding footwear and the child has said that the shoes were a birthday present from Owen. Morgan contends that the trip to the zoo and computer games were also birthday presents.


Owen then agrees that some items were for the child's birthday but contends that the cost of the shoes ($150) should be credited as the child needed them.


There is no evidence that Morgan intended that the shoes were to be credited as child support. The amount claimed is not credited. Owen is advised that Morgan's agreement should be sought before purchasing similar items in the future.


## Election to have a non-agency payment made to a third party credited towards less than 100% of the relevant liability


Parents can apply to have an amount paid to a third party credited against an enforceable maintenance liability or a carer liability (CSRC Act section 71A).


For amounts paid against an enforceable maintenance liability on or after 1 July 2008, the payer and the payee can agree to specify a percentage (that is less than 100%) at which the ongoing liability will be met by the third party non-agency payment (CSRC Act section 71A(2)). The percentage agreed to by the payee and payer cannot be changed after the non-agency payment has been accepted.


The agreed allocation percentage does not affect the overall amount to be credited. Rather, the agreed allocation percentage changes the rate at which the amount is credited against the liability. The third party non-agency payment will be applied against the ongoing liability at the specified percentage as the liability is raised each month until the credit is fully allocated.


Example:The payer Lee applies for a third party payment of $500 to be credited to his account. The payee Taylor states that she agrees that the payment was made in lieu of child support, however, she requires some periodic child support payments while the credit is being absorbed. Lee and Taylor agree to have the payment applied at the rate of 50% of the ongoing liability, and payer Lee will pay the other 50% of the ongoing liability, so that Taylor will still receive 50% of her child support as periodic payments.


If the parents cannot agree to a lesser percentage, the third party non-agency payment will be applied against 100% of the liability.


Example:Payer Olivia applies for a third party payment of $500 to be credited to her account. The payee Dennis states that he agrees that the payment was made in lieu of child support, however, he requires some periodic child support payments while the credit is being absorbed. Dennis asks for it to be applied at the rate of 50% of the ongoing liability. Olivia does not agree, therefore, the credit is applied against 100% of the liability.


If a non-agency payment is to be credited against 100% of the liability, it is applied against any child support outstanding and the remainder against future liabilities during the same child support enforcement period (1.1.C.100) as they are raised.


For amounts paid against a carer liability, the payer and the payee can agree to specify a percentage (that is less than 100%) at which the liability will be met by the third party non-agency payment (CSRC Act section 71A(2)). The percentage agreed to by the payee and payer cannot be changed after the non-agency payment has been accepted.


Example:Sam, the payer of the carer liability, applies for a third party payment of $500 to be credited against the $500 carer liability that she owes to Ewan, the payee of the carer liability. Ewan states that he only agrees that the payment was made in partial satisfaction of the carer liability, as he requires an amount of cash to meet his other expenses. Sam and Ewan agree to have the third party payment applied at the rate of 60% of the carer liability and Sam pays the remaining 40% to the Registrar in cash, which is then disbursed to Ewan.


## Credit against future liabilities


Where an amount (whether cash, property or provision of services) is credited as a non-agency payment satisfying an enforceable maintenance liability, any remaining excess amount can be applied against future amounts payable under the same enforceable maintenance liability during the same child support enforcement period, where this is consistent with the expressed intention of both the payer and the payee.


See7.5.2Prescribed non-agency payments for information about how uncredited amounts can be applied for these types of payments.


Where an amount is credited as a non-agency payment satisfying a carer liability, any remaining excess amount is disregarded and cannot be applied against future carer liabilities or enforceable maintenance liabilities.


## What happens to a credit if an assessment has ended or the enforceable maintenance liability is no longer payable to the Registrar?


Note:The information below relates to non-agency payments only. It does not apply to uncredited amounts for prescribed non-agency payments under CSRC Act section 71C, which can be carried over to a new child support enforcement period for the same liability.


If an enforceable maintenance liability or assessment ends with uncredited non-agency payments, these amounts will be disregarded. An uncredited amount paid within one child support enforcement period cannot be applied to future amounts that become payable in a different child support enforcement period. For example, uncredited non-agency payments cannot be carried over where:

• the parents make an election to end collection, and later make an application to resume collection
• a parent moves to a non-reciprocating jurisdiction, and later returns to Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction, or
• parents re-separate after a period of reconciliation (1.1.R.20).

Uncredited non-agency payments also cannot be carried over where there is a change in circumstances (for example, change in care or income) which creates a role reversal. A role reversal results in the payee becoming the new payer, and the payer becoming the new payee. An uncredited amount paid in respect of an enforceable maintenance liability cannot be credited towards a carer liability, and vice versa.


If a subsequent role reversal occurs and a parent returns to their previous role, an earlier uncredited amount cannot be credited towards their new liability as it is associated with a different child support enforcement period.


When the Registrar receives an election to end collection, the parents will be notified if there are any uncredited non-agency payments on the child support account. Similarly, the Registrar will notify the parents of any uncredited non-agency payments on the child support account when the Registrar requires the child support payee to make private arrangements to collect their child support.


## Discretion to refuse to credit an amount


The Registrar may refuse to credit a non-agency payment claimed if the Registrar is satisfied that, in the circumstances of the particular case, the amount ought not to be credited (CSRC Act section 71D).


The Registrar may refuse to credit an amount in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to the payee's agreement to credit an amount paid to a third party or payment made as a transfer of property was obtained through coercion or harassment. (However, where the Registrar is informed about this after the payment has been credited, it will be necessary for the payee to object to the Registrar's decision to credit the amount.)


See7.5.2for information on when the amount ought not to be credited on a prescribed non-agency payment.


## Objections


A payee can object to the Registrar's decision to credit a non-agency payment under CSRC Act section 71, 71A or 71C (CSRC Act section 80).


A payer and a payee can object to the Registrar's decisions to refuse to credit all or part of a non-agency payment under CSRC Act section 71, 71A or 71C (CSRC Act section 80).


## Other options


If a non-agency payment is not credited, there may be other options available to the payer, such as:

• applying for a variation to a court ordered liability (2.5.5) (10.4.2)
• applying for a change of assessment"> (1.1.C.50) under CSA Act Part 6A (Part 5)
• applying for a departure order under CSA Act Part 7 Division 4 (10.4.2)
• applying for an order under CSA Act Part 7 Division 5 to have non-periodic or payments to third parties credited against an assessment (10.4)
• making a child support agreement under CSA Act Part 6 providing for non-periodic amounts or payments to third parties to be credited against an assessment (Part 6).

# 7.5.2 Prescribed non-agency payments


## Context


The Registrar can credit a limited range of prescribed payments that have been paid directly to a payee (1.1.P.30) or third party (CSRC Act section 71C). Child support (1.1.C.60) legislation does not require both parties to agree that these types of payments were made in lieu of child support.

• Other options

## What is a prescribed non-agency payment and when can it be credited?


The Registrar can credit the payment up to a maximum amount that is equal to 30% of the amount payable under the payer's (1.1.P.40) child support liability for the period, only if:

• the payment was made in respect of an enforceable maintenance liability or a carer liability (1.1.C.30)
• 70% of the child support liability is paid as it becomes due and payable
• the payment is a payment of the kind specified in section 19 of the CSRC Regs
• the sum of those payments exceeds the sum of all such payments previously credited under this section against the liability for all past periods
• at the time the payment was made, the payer has less than 14% care of all of the children to whom the relevant administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) relates (CSRC Act section 71C(1)(d))
• at the time the payment was made, the child support liability was not being fully or partially met by a lump sum credit (CSRC Act sections 69A, 71C(2) and 71C(5)(b)), and
• the liability is not a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) or spousal and de facto maintenance order (CSRC Act section 71C(5)(a)), a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (CSRC Act section 71C(6)), or an agency reimbursement liability (1.1.A.60) (1.5.3.20) (CSRC Act sections 71(3) and 71A(4)).

The balance can be paid in cash or in the form of a non-agency payment credited under CSRC Act sections 71 or 71A, or from money credited from another source such as a tax refund or payment from a third party.


The Registrar can only credit amounts paid on or after 1 July 1999.


The types of payments that can be credited in this way are prescribed by regulation (CSRC Act section 71C(1)(b) and CSRC Regs section 19). They are:

• child care costs for the child who is the subject of the enforceable maintenance liability
• fees charged by a school or preschool for that child
• amounts payable for uniforms and books required by a school or preschool for that child
• fees for essential medical and dental services for that child
• the payee's share of amounts payable for the payee's home, and
• costs to the payee of obtaining and running a motor vehicle, including repairs and standing costs.

If the payer satisfies the conditions and the prescribed non-agency payment is accepted, the Registrar can credit up to 30% of the current liability from the date of notification of the payment. If the amount of the payment is more than 30% of the enforceable maintenance liability in a given month, the excess amount will be retained as an 'uncredited' amount. This uncredited amount can be applied against the payer's (1.1.P.40) enforceable maintenance liability in a later month provided the conditions for payment are again met, and can be carried over to a different child support enforcement period (1.1.C.100) as long as it relates to the same liability.


The Registrar cannot credit an uncredited amount towards any child support arrears (1.1.A.100) that accumulated prior to the payer notifying the Registrar of the prescribed payment. An uncredited amount can be applied to arrears that accumulate after the notification, but only when at least 70% of the liability is satisfied by cash or a non-agency payment credited under CSRC Act section 71 or 71A.


Example:A payer has a current liability of $100 per month and owes $3,000 in arrears.


In August 2013 the payer notifies the Registrar of a prescribed payment of $2,000 made that month, however, has not made any payments directly to the payee or to the Registrar.


As a result, the payer still owes $3,000 and has an uncredited amount of $2,000. This is because the prescribed payment cannot be applied to the arrears ($3,000), which accumulated prior to notification of the payment, and at least 70% of the current liability ($100) has not been paid.


If the payer pays $70 in cash (or has an equivalent amount credited as a non-agency payment under CSRC Act sections 71 or 71A) by the due date for August 2013 (7 September 2013), then $30 from the $2,000 uncredited amount is credited towards the current liability of $100. The arrears of $3,000 remain. The uncredited amount is reduced to $1,970.


If the payer does not pay for the months of August, September, October and November but pays $280 on 7 December 2013 (being 70% of the liabilities for August, September, October and November 2013), then $120 of the uncredited amount can be credited (that is, 4 × $30, leaving a balance of $1,880) and the arrears remain at $3,000.


If the payer instead pays $1,000 on 7 December 2013, $280 of the cash payment (70% of the liability) is applied to the liabilities raised for August, September, October and November (that is, $400) and $120 of the uncredited prescribed payment would be credited to the account. This leaves an uncredited balance of $1,880 and the cash payment in excess of 70% of the liabilities, being $720, is credited against the original arrears of $3,000.


If a retrospective variation is made to a liability, whether it results in an increase or a decrease, the amount credited from a prescribed payment remains unchanged despite the fact that the percentage of the prescribed payment has changed.


If the Registrar is collecting child support through employer withholding (1.1.E.20), the amount deducted will be adjusted to take into account the prescribed payments. If the prescribed payment constitutes 30% of the payer's liability for 2 months or less then the excess cash will be refunded. If the prescribed payment constitutes 30% of the liability for a period greater than 2 months, the payer will be given the option of having their deductions reduced or given a cash refund.


Payees who are in receipt ofFTBPart A above the base rate need to be made aware that when the Registrar notifies the Secretary of a prescribed payment, the payment will be included in theMITused to calculate FTB, even though it remains 'uncredited' for the Registrar's purposes. The whole amount will be assessed on the day that the payment was made to the third party or received by the payee.


### Child care costs for the child who is the subject of the enforceable maintenance liability


A payer can claim credit for amounts paid for child care, less any child care subsidy or additional child care subsidy that is deducted from the child care fees.


### Fees charged by a school or preschool for a child who is the subject of an enforceable maintenance liability


This can include school fees and levies, but not payment for non-compulsory camps, excursions, additional tuition or boarding costs. A school is an institution that mainly provides primary or secondary education.


It includes an institution providing technical and further education where the payment is for a course of secondary education.


### Amounts payable for uniforms & books required by a school or preschool for a child who is the subject of an enforceable maintenance liability


From 12 April 2001, a payer can claim credit for books and uniforms required by a school that the payer has obtained from any source. (The Registrar could previously only credit an amount paid for uniforms and books that the payer purchased from the child's school or preschool.) Amounts payable for books includes textbooks and exercise books but not stationery, computers, etc. Amounts payable for uniforms includes a school bag if prescribed by the school.


### Fees for essential medical & dental services for a child who is the subject of an enforceable maintenance liability


Essential medical and dental services are not limited to those services provided in an emergency.


A payer can claim only their actual costs. The Registrar will credit only the net amount after any rebate the person can claim from Medicare or a health insurance fund.


Prescribed payments include essential consultation fees for services provided by medical and dental practitioners, treatment by specialists, eye testing, X-rays, pathology tests, examinations and certain 'out-of-hospital' surgical procedures by Medicare approved practitioners. The cost of medication associated with essential treatment is also included, as well as equipment such as crutches or a vaporiser.


Prescribed payments include 'in-hospital' costs either as a public patient, or as a private patient in a public or private hospital. Costs can include accommodation and items such as theatre fees, anaesthetist costs, pathology, X-rays and medicines.


Prescribed payments may also include fees for medical or dental services not covered by Medicare, if they are essential for the child in the opinion of a practitioner approved by private health funds. These services include:

• emergency ambulance services
• physiotherapy
• speech and eye therapy
• chiropractic services
• podiatry
• psychological services
• optometry and repairs.

The Registrar will not allow a credit for fees for surgery or dentistry performed solely for cosmetic reasons. Where there is doubt, a parent can ask the service provider for more information.


Example:The cost of a nose reconstruction carried out by a cosmetic surgeon purely for cosmetic reasons would not be acceptable as a 'prescribed' payment. However, the cost of a nose reconstruction which alleviated a breathing difficulty or was performed following an accident would qualify.


Example:The cost of orthodontic work performed solely for cosmetic reasons will not qualify as a prescribed payment. However, if a general practitioner or orthodontist indicated that the work was necessary for the child's psychological wellbeing or essential dental health, it may be justified.


### The payee's share of amounts payable for the payee's home

• the payee's share of amounts payable for rent or a security bond for the payee's home
• the payee's share of amounts payable for utilities, rates or body corporate charges for the payee's home, and
• the payee's share of repayments on a loan that financed the payee's home.

Payments for utilities include gas, electricity, water and telephone, including the home phone portion of any phone / internet / mobile package.


Prescribed payments can only be made in relation to a home in which the payee lives and for which the payee is jointly or solely responsible. However, a bill for utilities does not need to be in the payee's name.


Prescribed payments can only be made for repayments on a loan that financed the payee's home where the payee is named on the mortgage documents and is liable for repayments on the loan.


Where the payer makes payments for the payee's home, for which they and the payee are jointly responsible, the Registrar will credit only the payee's share. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, this will be half the total amount.


Example:The parents separate in March 2019 and the payee continues to live in the home they shared. The home has gas connected, which is in the payer's name because the payer had originally organised the connection when they had moved into the home. The payer pays a gas account (which is in the payer's name) of $500 in November 2019, which covers the period from 1 July 2019 until 30 September 2019. The payee and children were residing in the home and thus solely benefited from the payment of the gas bill. The payer applies for credit of this $500 as a prescribed non-agency payment. The Registrar will credit this amount.


Example:Payer Theo and payee Nenne hold equal shares in the home in which Nenne continues to live. Theo applies to have payments for electricity and council rates credited as prescribed non-agency payments. Both bills have been issued in Theo's name. As Theo and Nenne are jointly liable for payment of council rates, the Registrar will credit 50% of the payment, being Nenne's share of the payment. As Nenne is solely liable for payment of the electricity account, the Registrar will credit 100% of the account as a prescribed payment.


The Registrar can only credit a prescribed non-agency payment if the amount has actually been paid or transferred. If a payer and payee disagree about whether a payment was made, or the amount of the payment, the Registrar will ask for evidence of the payment. The Registrar will decide, on the basis of all the evidence, whether or not a payment was made and the amount paid.


Example:Caspar, a payer, advises that they are paying monthly repayments of $500 on a mortgage for the home in which the payee Ariel lives. As Ariel is named on the mortgage documents as having an equal share in the property, the Registrar agrees to credit the payee's share of the loan repayments ($250) as prescribed non-agency payments. Ariel then supplies a bank statement and advises that Caspar has been regularly redrawing funds of $200 per month from their mortgage account. The Registrar contacts Caspar who agrees that payments have been withdrawn. The Registrar determines that payments of only $300 per month have been made and will credit the payee's share ($150).


### Costs to the payee of obtaining & running a motor vehicle, including repairs & standing costs


For vehicle costs to be considered as prescribed non-agency payments, the payee must have an obligation to pay the costs of obtaining and running the motor vehicle. This includes payments that are necessary to keep the vehicle on the road and to maintain its safety. For example, for service, repairs, tyres, registration and compulsory insurance premiums, as well as non-compulsory insurance premiums where the payee is an existing contributor. If the payee is a party to a loan or lease agreement for a vehicle, the costs may include the payee's share of lease payments or loan repayments.


Example:Goran, the payer, pays leasing costs for a leased car that is used by Riley, the payee. The lease agreement is between Goran and the lease company. As Riley is not a party to the lease agreement, they have no legal obligation for the leasing costs of the car. Goran's costs cannot be a prescribed non-agency payment because Riley has no legal obligation to pay for the costs of obtaining the motor vehicle.


Example:Blake, the payer, lets Skye, the payee, use one of his cars to shuttle their children to and from school, after school activities, medical appointments and other day-to-day activities. Blake owns the car and it is registered and insured in his name. Blake's costs of running the motor vehicle cannot be a prescribed non-agency payment because Skye has no legal obligation to pay those costs.


## Regular care of children and/or liability being met by a lump sum credit at the time the prescribed payment was made


A payer cannot claim a credit under CSRC Act section 71C when, at the time the payment was made:

• they had at least 14% care (more than below regular care (1.1.B.20)) of any of the children to whom the administrative assessment relates, and/or
• the child support liability is being fully or partially met by a lump sum credit (7.5.3).

If a parent applies to have a prescribed non-agency payment credited, and the above circumstances did not exist at the time the payment was made but exist at the time of the application, the application will be accepted. However, the payer will not receive the benefit of the 30% credit against their monthly liability until those circumstances again cease to exist.


Example:The payer Samuel asks for a payment of $1,000 to be credited as a prescribed non-agency payment on 20 November 2019. The payment was for school fees for Samuel and Yuki's children and was made on 8 July 2019, at which time Samuel had below regular care of both children. Samuel currently has below regular care of one of the children and regular care of the other child.


The amount claimed is accepted as a prescribed non-agency payment, as Samuel had below regular care of both children at the time the payment was made. However, Samuel will not currently receive the 30% credit against his ongoing liability as he now has regular care of one of the children. If, in the future, Samuel again has below regular care of both children he will start to receive the 30% credit against his ongoing liability.


Payments made prior to 1 July 2008 but advised to the Registrar on or after 1 July 2008 will be accepted and credited, regardless of the level of care the payer has of any of the children at the time of applying for the prescribed non-agency payment to be accepted.


## Discretion to refuse to credit an amount


The Registrar can refuse to credit a non-agency payment claimed under CSRC Act section 71C if the Registrar is satisfied that, in the circumstances of the particular case, the amount ought not to be credited (CSRC Act section 71D).


The Registrar may refuse to credit an amount in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:

• The payer is claiming a credit under CSRC Act section 71C for an expense they regularly meet that was taken into account in a change of assessment (1.1.C.50) decision. For example, the Registrar or a court has reduced the annual rate (1.1.A.70) (or refused to increase it) because the payer usually pays school fees, medical expenses for the child, mortgage or rent payments or any other prescribed payments.
• The payer is claiming credit under CSRC Act section 71C for an expense which they have undertaken to pay in addition to their liability as specified in an agreement between the parents (this does not have to be a child support agreement).
• The payer is claiming credit under CSRC Act section 71C for an expense that they are responsible to pay under the terms of a court order.
• The payer is claiming credit under CSRC Act section 71C for expenses for the child for which they are separately responsible. For example, the payer claims credit for child care costs for the days when the child resides with the payer. If the payer claims credit for a payment for which they and the payee are jointly responsible, and the amount does not relate to the payee's home, the Registrar has no basis of apportioning the payment and must credit the full amount. However, if there is evidence that the parents have explicitly agreed about how much each party will pay, the Registrar will apportion responsibility according to their agreement.
• The payer is claiming a credit under CSRC Act section 71C for loan repayments and they have a history of regularly withdrawing funds from the loan account using its redraw facility.

Example:Oliver, a payer, advises that they have recently paid $2000 towards private school fees for the child. Annalise does not agree that the parties intended this payment to be in lieu of child support. The Registrar agrees to credit this as a prescribed non-agency payment. Annalise then supplies emails in which Oliver agreed to take over payment of the private school fees in full. Oliver confirms the arrangement was made because Annalise could no longer afford to pay the fees and was going to remove the child from private education. The Registrar determines that in the circumstances Oliver is separately responsible for payment of the school fees and refuses to credit the amount.


Example:Basil, a payer, advises that they have paid $1,000 in orthodontic expenses for essential dental treatment for the child. Rodya does not agree that the parties intended the payment to be in lieu of child support. The Registrar agrees to credit the entire amount as a prescribed non-agency payment. Rodya then supplies a written payment plan which shows the parties agreed for Basil to pay 60% and Rodya to pay 40% of the orthodontic costs, and receipts showing that $1,000 was the total out-of-pocket expense. The Registrar determines that payment of only $400 should be credited, as Basil was responsible for payment of the other $600.


## Was a payment made?


## How is a non-cash payment valued?


## What happens to a credit if an assessment has ended or the enforceable maintenance liability is no longer payable to the Registrar?


Prescribed non-agency payments can be carried over to a new child support enforcement period for the same liability.


## Objections


A payee can object to the Registrar's decision to credit a non-agency payment under CSRC Act section 71, 71A or 71C (CSRC Act section 80).


A payer and a payee can object to the Registrar's decisions to refuse to credit all or part of a non-agency payment under CSRC Act section 71, 71A or 71C (CSRC Act section 80).


## Other options


See7.5.1for information on available options to the payer if a non-agency payment is not credited.

# 7.5.3 Crediting lump sum payments


## Context


The Registrar can credit lump sum payments of child support (1.1.C.60) if a binding child support agreement (1.1.B.30) (6.1) or court order make provision for a lump sum payment (10.4.2), and the amount of the lump sum equals or exceeds the annual rate (1.1.A.70) of child support payable under an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30).


See6.1for more information about lump sum payment provisions.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 66, section 69A


CSA Actsection 84(1)(e), section 84(7), section 84(8), section 123A


## Description


When the Registrar is notified that a lump sum payment has been paid in accordance with either of the following:

• a binding child support agreement between the parents (1.1.P.10) or non-parent carer which contains lump sum payment provisions (1.1.L.60) (CSA Act section 84(1)(e)), or
• a court order which contains lump sum payment provisions (CSA Act section 123A)

then the Registrar must credit the lump sum payment (CSRC Act section 69A).


Lump sum payments must be for an amount that is equal to or exceeds the current annual rate of child support payable under the administrative assessment (CSA Act section 84 (7)(c)(ii)).


## How lump sum payments are credited


Lump sum payments do not change the child support liability under the administrative assessment. Instead, they are credited at the end of the financial year against the liability. The ongoing child support payments are still payable at the time they become due, but they are reduced by the amount of the lump sum payment which will be credited against the liability at the end of the financial year.


Unless otherwise specified, the lump sum payment will be credited against 100% of the annual child support liability. However, if the agreement or court order specifies otherwise, it may be credited at a percentage that is less than 100% and the payer (1.1.P.40) will still be required to make ongoing child support payments at a reduced rate (CSRC Act section 69A(2)(a)(i)).


At the end of each financial year, the Registrar must reduce the remaining lump sum payment by the amount which has been credited against the liability under the child support assessment for that financial year, or since the start of the child support case if the case began later than the start of the financial year (CSRC Act section 69A).


At 1 July each year, the remaining lump sum payment is indexed in accordance with theCPI(CSRC Act section 69A(5)). See the tables in2.3.2for the CPI values to be used in indexation. This is to protect the value of the lump sum over time. The remaining lump sum payment continues to be credited against the payer's annual liability until the full value of the lump sum has been credited.


Example:Carlotta and Osman enter into a binding agreement with lump sum payment provisions. Carlotta is liable to pay child support of $5,000 per annum to Osman under an administrative assessment. The lump sum is for an amount of $20,000. Carlotta is not required to pay child support to Osman as their child support assessment is met from the remaining lump sum payment. At the end of the financial year, the Registrar reduces the remaining lump sum by $5,000 which covers the full amount of the administrative assessment for that year. The amount credited annually from the lump sum payment is equivalent to the annual amount of child support payable under an administrative assessment for that year (or part thereof if the remaining lump sum does not equal the full amount of the administrative assessment for that year). The remaining lump sum is increased annually in accordance with CPI.


Example:Arthur and Nerina have a court order with lump sum payment provisions. Arthur is liable to pay child support of $5,000 per annum to Nerina under an administrative assessment. The lump sum is for an amount of $20,000 and is to reduce the administrative assessment by 50% per annum. Arthur is still required to pay the 50% of the child support assessment ($2,500 per annum) which is not being met from the remaining lump sum payment. At the end of the financial year, the Registrar reduces the lump sum by $2,500. The amount credited annually from the remaining lump sum will be equivalent to 50% of the annual amount of child support payable under an administrative assessment for that year (or part thereof if the remaining lump sum does not equal 50% of the administrative assessment for that year). The remaining lump sum is increased annually in accordance with CPI.


Once the remaining lump sum payment reaches a nil balance, the payer is required to recommence making all ongoing child support payments pursuant to the administrative assessment.

# 8.1.1 Overpayments


## Context


Amounts paid in relation to a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) and/or a registered maintenance liability may exceed the amount that a person was entitled to receive under that liability. The treatment of overpayments (1.1.O.20) varies depending on the type of liability and how the overpayment occurred.


An overpayment in relation to an amount under the CSRC Act can create a carer debt (1.1.C.30) which arises where a payee (1.1.P.30) of a registered maintenance liability receives or is taken to have received a disbursement (1.1.D.60) to which they were not entitled.


Overpayments often relate to a liability arising under a child support assessment (for example, where that assessment has been retrospectively amended). However, an overpayment may also relate to a liability arising under other registrable maintenance liabilities (1.1.R.40).


## On this page

• Agency collect (1.1.A.50) - overpayments which are recoverable by the Registrar (carer debts)
• Methods of recovering carer debts
• Agency collect - overpayments which are not recoverable by the Registrar (carer debts)
• Overpayments in private collect (1.1.P.110) arrangements

## Agency collect - overpayments which are recoverable by the Registrar (carer debt)


A carer debt arises where the payee of a registered maintenance liability is paid an amount, or is taken to be paid an amount because of a debt offset and the payee was not entitled to be paid the amount (including because the registered maintenance liability was retrospectively varied).


A carer debt is due to the Commonwealth and recoverable by the Registrar. The payee of the registered maintenance liability is the payer (1.1.P.40) of the carer debt and has a carer liability. Where applicable, amounts recovered by Services Australia in relation to the carer debt are paid to the payer of the registered maintenance liability (the payer of the registered maintenance liability is the payee of the carer liability (section 69B(3)).


Example:The monthly liability is $1,000, and Services Australia collected the full amount due by the payer for the month of March. In May, the monthly liability for March was retrospectively changed to $800. This results in a carer debt of $200. Services Australia contacts the payee of the registered maintenance liability and explains that they owe a carer debt. The payee pays the amount of $200 to Services Australia.


Note:Different rules apply if the overpaid amount arises because of a decision that the registered maintenance liability should never have existed or because of the payer of the liability ceasing to be a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100) or a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) (see Agency collect - overpayments which are not recoverable by the Registrar).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 69B(1) to (3) Overpayments of payees


Policy reference:CS Guide8.1.6.10Offsetting debts between payers & payees


## Methods of recovering a carer debt


The Registrar may recover a carer debt using most of the same powers that are available to collect child support debt. A carer debt may be recovered by the following methods:

• offsetting the debt against ongoing child support liabilities or debts between payees and payers
• reducing carer debts when other debts are paid back
• the payee making a payment to Services Australia
• collecting through employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3)
• collecting from Australian Government payments (7.4.4)social security pensions and benefits (7.4.4.10)family tax benefit (7.4.4.20)veterans' pensions and allowances (7.4.4.30)parental leave payments (7.4.4.40)
• social security pensions and benefits (7.4.4.10)
• family tax benefit (7.4.4.20)
• veterans' pensions and allowances (7.4.4.30)
• parental leave payments (7.4.4.40)
• applying a tax refund for the payee against the debt (8.3.1)
• collecting from third parties (8.3.2)
• issuing a departure prohibition order (8.3.3)
• applying to a court for an order to enforce recovery of the debt (8.4).

A payee of a carer liability (who is the payer of the relevant registered maintenance liability) can privately enforce a carer debt in court only by instituting a proceeding under the CSRC Act.

## Agency collect - overpayments which are not recoverable by the Registrar


An amount is not repayable by a payee of a registered maintenance liability and is not a debt due to the Commonwealth if:

• the payee was not entitled to be paid the amount because the registered maintenance liability was subsequently retrospectively varied and that variation was becausea decision is made that the registered maintenance liability should never have existed, orthe payer of the registered maintenance liability stopped being a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction
• a decision is made that the registered maintenance liability should never have existed, or
• the payer of the registered maintenance liability stopped being a resident of Australia or a reciprocating jurisdiction

In relation to point (a) – this commonly arises where a court has made a declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child because they are not a parent (1.1.P.10). The effect of such an order is that the relevant application for administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) is taken never to have been accepted.


If a court makes a recovery order (1.1.R.30) requiring the former payee to repay an amount because the registered maintenance liability should never have existed (including because the former payer is not the parent) this liability can be registered for collection.


A court with jurisdiction under the CSA Act can make a recovery order in relation to amounts paid under registered maintenance liabilities which originate outside the CSA Act but are collected under the CSRC Act.

Policy reference:CS Guide8.4.7Recovery orders


## Overpayments in private collect arrangements


An overpayment in a private collect period is not a carer debt under the CSRC Act.


An overpayment amount may be privately recovered if:

• both parties agree that the payee is to repay the amount to the payer as a voluntary acceptance or settlement for repayment
• subject to the rules in CSA Act section 143, a payer obtains a recovery order in court (which may be registered for collection under the CSRC Act)
• in relation to a registrable maintenance liability that does not arise under a child support assessment - a court with jurisdiction to enforce recovery of the overpayment makes a recovery order in relation to the receiving person (under court enforcement powers existing outside child support legislation).

# 8.1.3 Apportionment of debt repayments between payees


## Apportionment of payments


Where the Registrar receives a payment from a person who owes:

• 2 or more child support debts (1.1.C.90) that relate to 2 or more enforceable maintenance liabilities with different payees (1.1.P.30), or
• 2 or more carer debts (1.1.C.30) (8.1.1) that relate to 2 or more carer liabilities with different payees

and the amount received is less than the sum of those debts, the Registrar must apportion the payment between the payees in proportion to the amount each of them is owed.


Example:Anton makes a payment of $600 for child support payable to Jen and Rita. Jen has no current entitlement but is owed arrears of $1,000. Rita is owed no arrears but has a current entitlement of $500. The total amount Anton owes is $1,500. Jen is owed two-thirds of the total and Rita is owed one-third of the total.


The Registrar apportions the payment accordingly, $400 to Jen and $200 to Rita.


Where a payer (1.1.P.40) owes a child support debt and a carer debt to different payees, and an amount received is less than the sum of those debts, both debts are treated equally. The Registrar must apportion the payment between the payees in proportion to the amount each of them is owed.


Example:Amy makes a payment of $600 for amounts payable to Billy and Clara. Billy is owed child support arrears of $900 and has a current entitlement of $100. Clara is owed $500 in overpaid child support (the carer debt).


The Registrar apportions the payment, $400 to Billy and $200 to Clara.


The exception to apportionments is where the Registrar receives an amount from the payer which has been paid in accordance with a court order made in enforcement proceedings brought by a payee (8.4.6). If this occurs, the Registrar will disburse the entire amount paid in accordance with the order to the payee who initiated the proceedings (up to the extent of the debt owed to that payee).

The Guides to Social Policy Law is a collection of publications designed to assist decision makers administering social policy law. The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 8.1.2 Establishing a payment arrangement


## Context


Services Australia can make arrangements with a parent who owes a child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt (1.1.C.30) to the Commonwealth to pay the debt in full, or by instalments. Services Australia will consider the circumstances of the particular case when coming to an arrangement for payment by instalments.


## Establishing a payment arrangement


ThePublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013(PGPA Act) section 63 gives the Finance Minister the power to modify the terms and conditions on which an amount owing to the Commonwealth is to be paid to the Commonwealth. These powers have been delegated to all accountable authorities, which includes Services Australia, and provide the delegation to certain officers within Services Australia to arrange for a parent (1.1.P.10) to pay a debt by instalments.


Arriving at a negotiated payment arrangement can be a useful first step in the enforcement process. It is often a more efficient way to assist a parent to meet their child support obligations than other methods of administrative enforcement.


The nature of an arrangement will differ depending on the circumstances of the case. In making a payment arrangement, Services Australia will consider:

• the amount outstanding
• the time it will take to repay the debt
• the need to have the debt paid in the shortest possible time
• the parent's ability to pay the debt in a lump sum
• whether it would be quicker and more effective for the parent to borrow and/or sell assets in order to pay the debt
• the effect of the arrangement on the child/ren of the assessment
• the protected earnings (1.1.P.120) amount (if a debtor is employed), and
• the need to make sure that any amount deducted is not so high that the debtor sees it as more attractive to leave their employment (if the debtor is employed).

An arrangement may include the following features:

• an agreement to pay the debt off in regular instalments
• an agreement on the date the debt will be satisfied in full
• an acknowledgment that if the parent's circumstances change, either the debt will be repaid in full or another repayment arrangement will be entered into
• an acknowledgment that if a tax refund becomes available during the period of the arrangement, it may be applied to the debt, and
• an acknowledgment that any failure to comply with the arrangement without reasonable excuse will mean that the debt is repayable in full at that time.

Services Australia can periodically review a payment arrangement to ensure it still reflects the parent's current financial circumstances. Arrangements can also be reviewed at any time if new information about the parent's capacity to pay becomes available or if their circumstances change.


A periodic payment arrangement does not prevent the Registrar from using other collection methods if they become available. This could include taking enforcement action if Services Australia receives information about a parent's financial circumstances that indicates the arrangement is no longer appropriate.

# 8.1.4 Why Services Australia would not pursue a debt


## Context


The Registrar must pursue recovery of all registered child support debts (1.1.C.90) unless the debts are uneconomical to pursue or not legally recoverable. The Registrar must also pursue recovery of carer debts (8.1.1), unless the debts are uneconomical to pursue or not legally recoverable.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 69B Overpayments of payees


Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013section 103(c) Rules relating to the Commonwealth and non‑corporate Commonwealth entities


Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014section 11 Recovery of debts


## Legal authority for the Registrar not to pursue a debt


The Registrar has no authority to release a person who owes a debt to the Commonwealth from payment of that debt. However, in limited circumstances, the Registrar can decide not to pursue recovery of a debt. The person would continue to owe the debt to the Commonwealth, but the Registrar will not take action to recover it unless the person's circumstances change.


Under thePublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013(PGPA Act) and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 the Registrar must pursue recovery of all debts to the Commonwealth for which the Registrar is responsible, unless:

• the Registrar is satisfied that the debt is not legally recoverable, or
• the Registrar considers that it is not economical to pursue recovery of the debt.

Act reference:Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013section 103(c) Rules relating to the Commonwealth and non‑corporate Commonwealth entities


Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014section 11 Recovery of debts


## Grounds for non-pursuit


Two categories for non-pursuit of debt are allowable under the PGPA Act. All debts must be pursued unless they are irrecoverable at law or uneconomical to pursue.


## Irrecoverable at law


A debt may be irrecoverable at law if:

• the Registrar has taken all reasonable action to recover the debt, but has not been able to collect itExample:The debtor is deceased and the executor of their estate has advised Services Australia that there are insufficient assets to meet any part of the child support liability.

the Registrar has taken all reasonable action to recover the debt, but has not been able to collect it


Example:The debtor is deceased and the executor of their estate has advised Services Australia that there are insufficient assets to meet any part of the child support liability.

• the debtor resides in a country that does not have reciprocal maintenance arrangements with Australia, and the payer does not derive any income or hold any assets in Australia.Example:The payer resides in China (which is not a reciprocating jurisdiction). The payer has business interests in China, but has no income or assets in Australia.

the debtor resides in a country that does not have reciprocal maintenance arrangements with Australia, and the payer does not derive any income or hold any assets in Australia.


Example:The payer resides in China (which is not a reciprocating jurisdiction). The payer has business interests in China, but has no income or assets in Australia.


## Uneconomical to pursue


A debt may be uneconomical to pursue if:

• it would cost the Commonwealth more than the amount of the debt to recover itExample:The debt is less than $500, unsuccessful recovery action has been taken and the debt balance has not changed for 12 months. The debtor has no capacity to pay the debt. The debtor is serving a period of imprisonment and has no assets or source of income. The debtor has been declared bankrupt and has no present or future capacity to pay.

it would cost the Commonwealth more than the amount of the debt to recover it


Example:The debt is less than $500, unsuccessful recovery action has been taken and the debt balance has not changed for 12 months. The debtor has no capacity to pay the debt. The debtor is serving a period of imprisonment and has no assets or source of income. The debtor has been declared bankrupt and has no present or future capacity to pay.

• Services Australia has taken reasonable action to trace a debtor for a continuous period of at least 6 months but their whereabouts remain unknown and Services Australia has not identified any income or assets belonging to the debtor.

Services Australia is required to maintain a register of all the debts that are not being pursued. Services Australia will regularly review a decision not to pursue recovery of a debt to establish whether there has been a change in the debtor's circumstances that would make it appropriate to resume action to pursue the debt.


Services Australia will not advise a payer that a decision has been made not to pursue recovery of their child support debt or carer debt. The debt is still owed and will remain on the payer's account. However, Services Australia may inform a payer that it will take no further action to recover the debt until the payer's circumstances indicate that they have a capacity to pay the debt. Services Australia will ask the payer to contact the Registrar as soon as the circumstances change.


Services Australia will advise the payee when a decision is made not to pursue recovery of a debt from a payer. Services Australia will invite the payee to advise the Registrar if they become aware of any change in the payer's circumstances that may make it possible for Services Australia to collect the debt.


A payee can object to a decision not to pursue recovery of a debt that has remained unpaid for at least 6 months. See10.2.

# 8.1.5 What is an obsolete debt?


## Context


Some entries in the Register (1.2.1.10) may become obsolete. If a maintenance debt is determined to be obsolete, the Registrar will remove the maintenance debt from the Register and will not collect it.


## On this page

• Obsolete entries in Child Support Register
• Entries that can be made obsolete
• Deceased persons
• Overseas liabilities
• Debt that cannot be removed using the obsolete entry process
• Enforcement by the payee
• Objection rights

## Obsolete entries in Child Support Register


If the Registrar is satisfied that an entry in relation to an enforceable maintenance liability is obsolete, the entry can be deleted from the Register.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 41 Obsolete entries in Child Support Register


## Entries that can be made obsolete


In limited circumstances a maintenance debt registered for collection by the Registrar can become obsolete. Such a decision can be made when all available collection avenues have been explored and there is no prospect of collecting outstanding child support (1.1.C.60).


The entries that can be considered obsolete are limited to:

• overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40), or
• a maintenance liability owed by a payer (1.1.P.40) who is deceased.

An entry will only be obsolete if the child support case (1.1.C.80) has:

• ended
• a non-pursuit of debt decision was made less than 6 months ago, or
• the case meets the criteria for non-pursuit of debt
• where the payer is deceased, the outstanding child support cannot be collected because the estate has been finalised (or the payer has died intestate and a court application for Letters of Administration has not, and is unlikely, to be made by anyone), or
• the liability is a registered overseas maintenance liability (other than New Zealand cases), and the payer and payee (1.1.P.30) are not residents of Australia (1.1.R.100).

## Deceased persons


The obsolete entry provision can be used to delete some maintenance debts owed by a deceased payer where there is no avenue to collect the debt.


If a payer dies testate (that is, they had a valid Will at the time of their death), the Registrar may collect from the estate via the executor of the estate if there are funds available to address the outstanding debt. Once the estate is finalised and, if the maintenance debt has not been fully paid, then that debt can be considered to be an obsolete entry.


If a payer died intestate (that is, there is no valid Will), a court application for Letters of Administration is required (for a person to administer the estate) if there are any assets to be distributed to beneficiaries. If a payer died 2 or more years ago and no such court application has been and is unlikely to be made (for example, the deceased person had no assets) then that debt can be considered to be an obsolete entry.


An entry cannot be obsolete because the payee is deceased. If a payee dies testate, the Registrar may disburse child support collected to the executor of the estate. If a payee dies intestate, a court application for Letters of Administration can be obtained (for a person to administer the estate) and child support collected can be disbursed to the administrator of the estate.


## Overseas liabilities


For overseas liabilities that have been registered for collection, an obsolete entry determination can only be made when:


the payer and payee are no longer Australian residents, and


the debt is an overseas maintenance liability registered in accordance with section 18A of the CSRC Act (see1.5.3.40on registrable overseas maintenance liabilities).


A maintenance debt arising from a New Zealand child support liability cannot be obsolete.


If an overseas maintenance debt is determined to be an obsolete entry, the liability will cease to be enforced in Australia but may continue to be owed in the originating jurisdiction.


If the payer or payee returns to Australia then a new application can be made to register the overseas maintenance liability, including any arrears (1.1.A.100) that remain outstanding at that point in time.


Example:The Registrar has registered a court order for child maintenance that was made in the UK. Terry has been residing in Australia and Shannon has always resided in the UK. Terry has recently moved permanently to the USA. The case has ended because neither party reside in Australia. There is $42,074 still owing in child maintenance. There are no options for collecting this debt and a non-pursuit of debt decision was made when the case ended. This outstanding child maintenance can be removed from the Register under section 41.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 18A Liability in relation to registrable overseas maintenance liabilities, section 41 Obsolete entries in Child Support Register


## Debts that cannot be removed using the obsolete entry process


Some debts cannot be removed from the Register as they are not enforceable maintenance liabilities. These are:

• late payment penalties (1.1.L.20)
• estimate penalties
• costs and fines
• consolidated revenue debts, and
• carer debts (1.1.C.30).

Costs and fines, consolidated revenue debts and carer debts are debts to the Commonwealth and may be waived under thePublic Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013(see11.1.4on waiver). However, as a carer debt will be paid to a third party (that is, the payee of the carer debt), these debts are unlikely to be waived.


Late payment (8.2) and estimate penalties (3.4.5) may be remitted or cancelled.


## Enforcement by the payee


The Registrar's decision to remove the debt from the Register because the entry is obsolete does not prevent the payee from taking action privately to recover outstanding child support.


## Objection (1.1.O.10) rights


A payer or payee can object to the Registrar's decision to delete an entry from the Register. See10.2.

# 8.1.6.20 Reduction of debts when other debts paid back


## Context


The Registrar can reduce child support debts (1.1.C.90) or carer debts (1.1.C.30) (8.1.1) owed by one person in relation to a liability where that person would otherwise be entitled to be paid debt amounts that were owed to them in relation to another liability.


## On this page

• Reduction of debts under section 71AB
• Effect of reducing a debt under section 71AB
• When a liability is later varied
• Notification

## Reduction of debts under section 71AB


Under section 71AB(1), if:

• a person ('the first person') owes either a child support debt or carer debt ('the first debt')
• the Registrar receives an amount ('the repayment amount') from another person that is owed by that person, and is intended by that person, to be in partial or complete satisfaction of a child support debt or carer debt owed to the first person, and
• the Registrar would, apart from section 71AB, be required to pay the repayment amount to the first person under either section 69B(3) or section 76

then, the Registrar may:

• credit the repayment amount against the amount payable under the first debt, and
• if after the amount has been credited, the first debt has been paid in full, pay any excess to the first person.

When deciding whether to credit the repayment amount against the amount payable under the first debt, the Registrar may consider a number of factors, including:

• the nature of the debts (carer vs child support (1.1.C.60))
• whether the cases are active or ended, and
• the relative size of the debts.

The Registrar's primary consideration will be to ensure that the ongoing financial needs of any children in a parent's care can be met. The policy aims to balance the day-to-day needs of parents (1.1.P.10) with actual care of a child support child and the expenses they are incurring, with the rights of parents to enforce a debt owed to them.


The Registrar may pursue collection from either person by other means even when a debt reduction is in place in relation to their child support debt or carer debt, for example, by intercepting a tax refund.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 69B(3) Overpayments of payees, section 71AB Reduction of child support debts or carer debts when other debts are paid back, section 76 Entitlement of payees of registered maintenance liabilities to be paid collected amounts


## Effect of reducing a debt under section 71AB


Any amount reduced under section 71AB is taken to be paid by the first person, in relation to their child support debt or carer debt. Therefore, a debt reduction cannot be reversed.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 71AB Reduction of child support debts or carer debts when other debts are paid back


## When a liability is later varied


Where the Registrar has credited a child support payment towards the first person's debt and the first person's child support entitlement is later reduced with retrospective effect:

• The first person may have an overpayment (1.1.O.20) as the first person is taken to have received the repayment amount.
• This can create a carer debt and the first person becomes liable to repay the debt to the payer (1.1.P.40) of the child support payment (see8.1.1for further information on overpayments and carer debts).

Example:Polly owes a child support debt of $100 to Fergus, and Ned owes a child support debt of $50 to Polly in a separate child support case (1.1.C.80). Ned makes a $50 payment to the Registrar for the child support debt he owes to Polly. The Registrar credits this repayment amount to the child support debt that Polly owes to Fergus. Polly now owes $50 in child support debt to Fergus.


The child support assessment between Polly and Ned is varied with retrospective effect. The variation reduces Polly's entitlement by $50. As Polly is taken to have received the $50 that was paid by Ned, Polly now owes a carer debt of $50 to Ned.


If the first person, who has their child support payment credited to their other debt, becomes entitled to additional child support as a result of a retrospective increase:

• Services Australia may credit the additional amount received to any remaining debt that the first person owes to another person in a separate case.
• Where the first person owes a carer debt, Services Australia will make a considered decision before crediting the child support payment towards the carer debt.
• If after the child support has been credited, the first person's relevant debt has been paid in full, any excess amount is paid to the first person.

## Notification


The first person will be advised in writing when amounts have been applied against their first debt under section 71AB. A person does not have the right to object to the Registrar's decision to reduce, or refuse to reduce, a debt under section 71AB.

# 8.1.6.10 Offsetting debts between payers & payees


## Context


The Registrar can offset certain debts owed by 2 people in the same child support case (1.1.C.80) if the Registrar would be obliged to pay the amounts collected from one to the other.


## On this page

## What kinds of debts can be offset


The Registrar may offset debts between 2 people in the same child support case who each have a child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt (1.1.C.30) due to the Commonwealth under the CSRC Act if those debts arise under:

• a child support assessment (1.1.C.70)
• a liability to pay periodic child maintenance arising from a court order or court registered maintenance agreement or a collection agency maintenance liability
• a recovery order (1.1.R.30) that is registered for collection by the Registrar (8.4.7), or
• a carer liability (8.1.1).

Only debts arising from a liability referred to above can be offset. In the case of amounts due under a child support assessment, child maintenance order, court registered agreement, collection agency maintenance liability, or a carer liability, the Registrar can only offset these if they relate to a child of whom both parties are the parents (1.1.P.10).


Debts due to spousal maintenance, registrable overseas maintenance liabilities (1.1.O.40) and penalties are unable to be offset.


Debts can be offset by deducting the whole amount, or part of the amount, of the smaller debt from the larger debt. The circumstances of an individual case may result in the Registrar determining that it is preferable to deduct only part of the amount. The decision will take into account the ongoing needs of the parent with care of the children, and the past and present obligations of both parents to pay child support when due. If one of the debts arises from a recovery order, the Registrar will consider the terms of the order and in particular any repayment schedule specified in the order.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 4-'carer liability', section 17 Liabilities in relation to children that are registrable maintenance liabilities, section 17A Liabilities in relation to persons who have paid amounts where no liability to pay because the person is not the parent, section 69B Overpayments of payees, section 71AA Registrar may offset debts between payer and payee


CSA Actsection 143 Amounts paid where no liability to pay exists etc.


## Where the debts are of equal amounts


If the debts are equal, the Registrar may offset one against the other and the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered both of the debts in full. In most cases where the debt is equal, this is the desirable outcome.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 71AA(2) Registrar may offset debts between payer and payee


## Where the debts are not equal


If the Registrar offsets debts for different amounts, then the Commonwealth is taken to have recovered the amount of the smaller debt that is offset and an equal amount of the larger debt. Where the debts are not equal amounts, it will generally be appropriate to offset the full amount of the smaller debt against an equal amount of the larger debt.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 71AA(3) Registrar may offset debts between payer and payee


## Offsetting a debt against an ongoing liability


Where the Registrar offsets unequal debts, the remaining amount of the larger debt is still a debt due to the Commonwealth. If the person with the larger debt is entitled to future child support payments payable by the other person, the Registrar may offset the remaining debt against all or part of the other person's ongoing liability as it becomes due and payable each month. In general, the Registrar will offset the remaining debt against all of the other person's ongoing liability. However, the circumstances of an individual case may result in the Registrar determining that it is preferable for only part of the ongoing liability to be offset.


Where the debt is offset in part, the balance of the month's child support liability is to be paid by the other person as it becomes due and payable.


The Registrar may pursue collection from the person with the larger debt by other methods even when a debt offset is in place, in relation to that person's current entitlement to child support, for example, by intercepting a tax refund. This is because the debt offset arrangement does not alter the fact that the person with the larger debt continues to owe a debt to the Commonwealth, so the debt owing can be recovered by methods other than offsetting.


Other methods of recovery would not apply to the person with the smaller debt. A full offset of that person's ongoing liability (the smaller debt) against the larger remaining debt of the other person means that if another smaller debt is accrued it is immediately recovered each time that it becomes due and payable, and so there is no debt owed (no 'overdue' debt) for the person with the smaller debt.


If a partial offset applies but the balance of the monthly liability that should be paid by the person with the smaller debt is not paid when it becomes due and payable, that unpaid amount would become a debt owed. In general, it would be appropriate to offset that unpaid amount against the larger debt, rather than to pursue other methods of recovery. The non-payment of the balance may also indicate a need to reconsider whether an ongoing partial offset continues to be a suitable arrangement, or whether a full offset would be preferable.


Example:Helena was previously the payer of a registered maintenance liability arising under a child support assessment. Helena's children have now come to live with her. Helena has a debt of $3,000 from the period when she was a child support payer. Even though the children are no longer living with Theo, he is entitled to $3,000 in child support when Helena pays it.


Theo has now been assessed as having a child support liability. Under that liability, Theo has a debt of $150 in respect of a calendar month.


The Registrar offsets $100 of the debt (part of it only) that became due and payable by Theo against the amount owed by Helena. The effect of the offset is that Helena is taken to have paid $100 of her debt per calendar month. Theo is taken to have paid $100 of his liability to pay $150. Under the liability, Theo must pay $50 for that calendar month.


Until Helena's debt has been fully offset, Theo's liability arising under his assessment may be offset against the remainder of Helena's debt.


## Effect of offsetting a debt


Any amount recovered by way of offset is taken to be paid to the Registrar by the person with the debt and paid to the person owed the debt as provided for under the CSRC Act. Therefore, a debt offset cannot be reversed.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 71AA(4) Registrar may offset debts between payer and payee


## When a liability is later varied


Where the Registrar offsets a person's child support debt against that person's entitlement to receive child support from the other person and their entitlement is later reduced with retrospective effect, the person may have an overpayment as the person is taken to have received the offset amount. This can create a carer debt and the person becomes liable to repay the debt to the other person (See8.1.1for further information on overpayments and carer debts).


If the person who has their debt offset against their entitlement becomes entitled to additional child support as a result of a retrospective increase, the additional child support would generally be fully offset against any remaining debt owed by the person. The debt offset would apply until the person's remaining debt is fully recovered.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 69B(1)(a)(ii) Overpayments of payees


## Notification


All offset arrangements will be confirmed in writing with both people. However, neither person has the right to object to the Registrar's decision to offset, or refuse to offset, a debt.

# 8.3 Child support debt - administrative enforcement


## Introduction


This chapter describes Services Australia's administrative methods of collecting child support (1.1.C.60). These are actions that Services Australia can take to enforce payment of child support.


The Registrar can collect child support as voluntary payments from the payer (1.1.P.40) or by intercepting money which would otherwise be payable to a payer (for example, a tax refund or from their employer). The involvement of a court is not required. The Registrar can exercise certain administrative enforcement powers by issuing a notice. However, legal requirements apply to the form and service of notices, and legal consequences flow from their use.


Each topic below describes the collection method, and the consequences and restrictions which apply to its use.

• 8.3.1 Tax refund intercepts
• 8.3.2 Collection from third parties

# 8.2 Late payment penalties


## Context


LPP(1.1.L.20) apply where a parent (1.1.P.10) fails to pay their child support debt (1.1.C.90) by the due date (7.1.2). The Registrar can remit LPP in certain circumstances.


## On this page

• Applying a LPP
• Remitting a LPP
• Circumstances beyond the parent's control
• Circumstances within a parent's control
• Reasonable action to mitigate the circumstances that led to late payment, or the effect of those circumstances
• Special circumstances
• Fair and reasonable to remit the penalty
• LPP incentive offer
• Notification of decision

## What is a LPP?


The purpose of a LPP is to encourage parents to comply voluntarily with their obligation to pay child support (1.1.C.60) and discourage late payment. A LPP is a debt due and payable to the Commonwealth. Any LPPs collected are paid into consolidated revenue. They are not paid to the payee (1.1.P.30).


## Applying a LPP


The Registrar calculates LPP on the unpaid balance of a parent's child support debt after the due date for each payment period (1.1.P.50). The rate of the penalty is the general interest charge rate underTaxation Administration Act 1953.


The Register can be varied to remove any LPP applied because a parent failed to pay an amount of child support that is no longer due. Examples of situations where LPP may be removed include instances where the parent's debt is adjusted to take into account:

• a variation to the liability because of a retrospective court order, or an amended child support assessment (1.1.C.70)
• a payment made directly to the payee on or before the due date, or
• the correction of an administrative error.

Situations where a LPP should be removed in part or in full are not limited to these examples.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 66 When child support debts become payable, section 67 Penalty for late payment of child support debts, section 67A Due date of certain debts for the purposes of calculating penalty


Taxation Administration Act 1953section 8AAD What is the general interest charge rate?


## Remitting a LPP


The Registrar can decide to remit a LPP in part or in full and can decide to remit penalties whether or not they have been paid. The Registrar will use this discretion in a way that will further the objectives of the Child Support Scheme, according to the particular circumstances of each case.


There is no particular form for a parent to request remittance of LPP. The Registrar can remit LPP without a request to do so, if there is sufficient information available to make a decision.


LPP can be remitted in any of the following 3 situations:

• The parent did not pay on time because of circumstances beyond their control, and they have taken reasonable action to mitigate those circumstances or their effects.
• The parent did not pay on time because of circumstances within their control, and they have taken reasonable action to mitigate those circumstances or their effects and it would be fair and reasonable to remit the penalty having regard to those circumstances.
• There are special circumstances in the case which make it fair and reasonable to remit the penalty.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 68 Remission of late payment penalty, section 69 Reduction of late payment penalty where judgment debt carries interest


## Circumstances beyond the parent's control


Examples of circumstances that may be beyond a parent's control include:

• the parent's employer failing to remit deductions to the Registrar
• short-term unemployment
• unpredictable adverse business conditions
• industrial accidents
• a debtor's failure to pay
• natural disasters.

Circumstances beyond the parent's control are not limited to these examples.


The Registrar will take into account the circumstances that applied at the time each payment was due and when each penalty accrued when deciding whether to remit penalties that accrued over a number of payment periods. It may be appropriate to remit the LPP for one payment period but inappropriate to remit the penalty for another payment period.


The Registrar will remit the penalty in full if satisfied that the circumstances leading to the late payment were beyond the control of the liable parent. The Registrar needs to be satisfied that the parent has taken reasonable action to mitigate the circumstances that contributed to late payment or the effects of those circumstances.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 68(1)(a) Remission of late payment penalty


## Circumstances within a parent's control


Some examples of circumstances that may be within a parent's control:

• financial difficulties due to a number of debts, such as rates and electricity, becoming due at the same time, or
• voluntary unemployment during which the person takes no action to vary the liability.

Circumstances within the parent's control are not limited to these examples.


The Registrar will take into account the circumstances that applied at the time each payment was due and when each penalty accrued when deciding whether to remit penalties that accrued over a number of payment periods. It may be appropriate to remit the LPP for one payment period but inappropriate to remit the penalty for another payment period.


The Registrar must consider whether the nature of the circumstances would make it fair and reasonable to remit the LPP attributable to those circumstances. If so, the Registrar can remit the LPP in part or in full but only if the parent can demonstrate that they have taken reasonable action to mitigate the circumstances that contributed to late payment or the effects of those circumstances.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 68(1)(b) Remission of late payment penalty


## Reasonable action to mitigate the circumstances that led to late payment, or the effect of those circumstances


The Registrar will consider any steps the parent has taken to reduce the effects of the circumstances that led to late payment. A parent's payment history may be sufficient to demonstrate the efforts they have made to meet their child support liability, in spite of the circumstances that led to the late payment.


Examples of attempts to mitigate the circumstances that led to late payment or to mitigate the effects of those circumstances include:

• part payment of the liability
• attempting to or succeeding in borrowing to pay some or all of the liability
• negotiating with creditors or debtors or both
• paying in full following resolution of a dispute (for example, over arrears (1.1.A.100) or a payment made directly to the payee)
• making and meeting an acceptable arrangement for payment.

Attempts to mitigate the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment or mitigate the effects of those circumstances are not limited to these examples.


Payments received as a result of Services Australia enforcement action such as:

• deductions made from Centrelink payments
• intercepting an income tax refund, and
• legal action to obtain payment

are unlikely to be a mitigating circumstance by themselves. This does, however, depend on the circumstances of the case. For example, action may prompt the liable parent to make an acceptable arrangement for payment, or the liable parent may draw the Registrar's attention to an expected refund.


## Special circumstances


The Registrar can remit part or all of a LPP if satisfied that there are special circumstances in the case that would make it fair and reasonable to do so. Special circumstances include those circumstances all parents face regardless of whether or not they separated.


Examples of special circumstances may include:

• a serious accident
• being unaware of the registration of the liability (if the Registrar does not know the parent's whereabouts)
• an unexpected and unavoidable expense
• serious health problems
• the payer acting on incorrect advice.

Special circumstances are not limited to these examples.


It may also be appropriate to remit a LPP if the Registrar is satisfied that a parent made their first payment late because they did not understand the operation of the Child Support Scheme. This would not be an acceptable reason for the Registrar to remit a penalty on more than one occasion.


Where the Registrar is satisfied that special circumstances exist that would make it fair and reasonable to remit a LPP, the Registrar does not have to consider whether a parent has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the circumstances that led to late payment, or the effect of those circumstances.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 68(1)(c) Remission of late payment penalty


## Fair & reasonable to remit the penalty


The Registrar must be satisfied that it is fair and reasonable to remit a LPP if the late payment was caused by circumstances within the parent's control, or because of special circumstances. The Registrar will take into account the parent's payment history, current income and necessary commitments, as well as the nature of the circumstances that led to late payment. It would not usually be fair and reasonable to pay other debts or acquire assets in preference to paying child support debts, although this depends on the predictability and nature of the expense.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 68(1)(c) Remission of late payment penalty


## LPP incentive offer


If a parent enters into a reasonable payment arrangement to pay all arrears while maintaining full and timely payment of any current liability, and they satisfy the requirements forremitting a LPP:

• the Registrar will remit 25% of the current LPP immediately, and
• at the same time, record a recommendation for the remission of the balance of the LPP upon full payment of the arrears in accordance with the negotiated payment arrangement.

A 'reasonable payment arrangement' will depend on the circumstances of each case.


Note:A payment arrangement can be renegotiated if financial circumstances change such that the agreed rate is no longer affordable.


## Notification of decision


If the Registrar makes a decision to remit only part of a LPP, or not to remit any part of a penalty, the Registrar must serve written notice of the decision to the parent who is liable to pay the penalty. The notice must also include, or be accompanied by, a statement that the parent can object to the decision (10.2) and apply to theARTfor review of the objection decision if dissatisfied with that decision (10.3).

# 8.3.2 Collection from third parties


## Context


The Registrar can issue a notice to someone who owes money to a relevant debtor requiring that the money be paid to the Registrar in satisfaction of relevant debts. This power is separate from the Registrar's power to collect child support (1.1.C.60) through employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3), or deduct amounts from Australian Government payments (7.4.4) or tax refunds (8.3.1).


If a person within Australia is controlling money on a relevant debtor's behalf while the relevant debtor is overseas, a notice may be issued requiring the money be paid to the Registrar.


See8.3.1for the definitions of 'relevant debt' and 'relevant debtor'.

# 8.3.1 Tax refund intercepts


## Context


Generally, the Registrar will automatically obtain and apply a tax refund amount if there is a relevant debt that is due and payable. This is known as a tax refund intercept (1.1.T.40).


The Registrar will apply the tax refund amount unless there are reasons not to do so. A tax refund might not be intercepted, if the relevant debtor would suffer financial hardship. A person who is suffering serious financial hardship and expecting a tax refund amount should contact Services Australia to discuss their circumstances and to make a payment arrangement before they lodge their tax return.

## When can a tax refund be intercepted?


A tax refund can be intercepted by the Registrar where:

• the Commissioner of Taxation would otherwise be required to refund an amount to a person under taxation law, and
• the person owes a relevant debt to the Commonwealth.

In such circumstances, the Registrar can require the Commissioner to pay the tax refund amount or the amount owing as a debt (whichever is the lesser) to the Registrar. The Registrar applies this amount to the person's debt.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72 Application of certain amounts to debts under this Act


Taxation Administration Act 1953section 8AAZLF Commissioner must refund RBA surpluses and credits


## Relevant debts


A 'relevant debt' is a child support debt (1.1.C.90), a child support related debt (1.1.C.160) or a carer debt (1.1.C.30). A 'relevant debtor' is the person who is liable to pay a relevant debt.


The Registrar cannot obtain and hold a tax refund amount in order to apply it to a debt that may become due and payable in the future. However, intercepted tax refund amounts can be applied to debts that are due but not yet payable.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 4-'relevant debt', section 72(1)(b) Application of certain amounts to debts under this Act


## Which amounts can be applied to debts?


Amounts that the Commissioner of Taxation would otherwise refund to a taxpayer under taxation law can be applied to that person's relevant debt. The Commissioner will notify the Registrar of any tax refund amount available after assessing a taxpayer's income tax return or after a business activity statement has been lodged.


If the person's relevant debt equals or exceeds the amount of the tax refund amount owing to the person, the Registrar can apply the full tax refund amount to the debt. Where the relevant debt is less than the tax refund amount, the Registrar can apply an amount of the tax refund equal to the amount of the debt. The Commissioner will refund the balance to the person.


A tax refund amount can include refundable tax offset amounts such as a private health insurance offset. Where a relevant debtor is entitled to a refundable tax offset, it is applied as a tax offset to that person's tax liability. A person's tax liability is the tax payable by that person based upon his or her taxable income. If a refundable tax offset is greater than the tax liability, the excess amount is refunded to the taxpayer.


Example:A taxpayer who has a low taxable income claims the private health insurance offset. The taxpayer has paid premiums of $2,300 for a complying private health insurance policy and has a rebate percentage of 30%. They claim their rebate of $690 through their tax return. If the claim is paid, the Registrar can apply the refunded amount towards a relevant debt owed by the taxpayer.


Other tax rebates that act as tax offsets also operate in this manner including the overseas forces tax offset and the education tax refund (for 2010-11 and earlier years).


For tax offsets other than refundable tax offsets, the offset can only reduce the person's tax payable to zero. That is, if the person's tax offsets are greater than their tax due, the excess is not refunded. However, applying a tax offset may still result in a tax refund amount if it means the person has paid more tax during the year than required.


Example:A taxpayer has a child support debt of $5,500 and is entitled to a non-refundable tax offset of $3,000. The offset will result in a $3,000 refund of the person's tax instalment deductions. The Registrar can intercept the person's tax refund to apply to the person's child support debt.


Not all amounts that are paid by the Commissioner are subject to the tax refund intercept (1.1.T.40) process in the child support legislation. A potential refund to a company associated with a person who owes a debt is not subject to section 72.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72 Application of certain amounts to debts under this Act


Taxation Administration Act 1953section 8AAZLF Commissioner must refund RBA surpluses and credits


## Financial hardship


The Registrar will consider a person is in financial hardship if, at the time that the Registrar is considering taking their tax refund amount, the person can show that:

• their financial commitments exceed their income, or
• they have specific expenses to pay outside their essential living expenses.

The expenditure is not limited to their basic needs such as food, clothing, accommodation, utilities, and education costs for children, however, the expenses must be necessary and the person must have explored other payment options to address these expenses or debts.


If the person has made, or will enter into, a satisfactory payment arrangement for their relevant debt, the Registrar will not apply their tax refund amount to the debt if doing so would deprive that person of the ability to meet their other commitments.


The Registrar will not consider that a person will suffer financial hardship if applying a tax refund amount merely limits their social activities or entertainment, or limits access to goods or services of a better nature or standard.


The Registrar will also consider:

• the extent to which the person knowingly contributed to the circumstance, and
• the number of times the person has previously claimed financial hardship.

Example:A payer, Michael, has a child support debt of $1,040. Michael has lodged a tax return and is expecting a tax refund amount of $1,300. Michael's current child support liability is theMAR(1.1.M.20) (2.3.4). The Registrar is collecting the prescribed amount from Michael's social security benefit in satisfaction of his current liability and arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support (1.1.C.60).


Michael claims to have no job, money or assets and is about to be evicted unless he pays rent of $850 within the next 2 weeks. Michael also has an overdue electricity account. Michael's next social security payment is not due for 2 weeks.


Michael agrees to pay $10 per week by direct payments to the Registrar, in addition to the prescribed amount deducted from his social security benefit. Michael will make the first payment in 2 weeks' time. It will take Michael 2 years to repay his arrears at this agreed rate. The Registrar decides to release Michael's tax refund amount on the basis that Michael is suffering financial hardship, and that his present circumstances do not allow him to repay the debt more quickly. Michael undertakes to contact Services Australia when his situation improves to make a new arrangement.

# 8.1.7 Election to end collection of arrears


## Context


If a payee (1.1.P.30) (or payee and payer (1.1.P.40) jointly) has made an election for the Registrar to end collection (they opt out to private collect (1.1.P.110)), the payee may also elect for the Registrar to not collect any child support (1.1.C.60) arrears (1.1.A.100). The payee may apply for a liability (in some circumstances including arrears), to become enforceable again after they have opted out. See7.4.1.10for more information about reapplying for collection.


## On this page

• Election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears
• Varying the Register after an election to end collection of arrears
• Changes to the liability after an election to end agency collect

## Election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears


A payee can elect for the Registrar to not collect any unpaid amounts from an agency collect period (arrears) if an agency collect arrangement ends because:

• The payee elects for the Registrar to end collection of child support (they opt out to private collect – see7.3.1.10)
• A terminating event ends a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) or a court-ordered liability

When a payee elects for the Registrar to end collection of arrears in either of these circumstances, the arrears become payable to the payee rather than the Commonwealth. The payee becomes responsible for enforcing the payment of arrears privately.


When a payee elects for the Registrar to end collection of child support (agency collect (1.1.A.50)), or if a child support assessment or a court-ordered liability ends because of a terminating event, the payee can elect for the Registrar to not collect any unpaid amounts (arrears). This election means the arrears are payable to the payee directly rather than the Commonwealth. The payee can then enforce payment of the arrears privately.


A payee (or payer and payee jointly) cannot elect to have the Registrar continue collecting ongoing amounts of child support but stop collecting arrears.


If the payee is in receipt of more than the base rate of FTB Part A, the payee should consider the implications for FTB of their election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears. See FA Guide3.1.6.70.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable …, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


## Varying the Register after an election to end collection of arrears


The Registrar will vary the Register to show that any arrears the payee has elected to not have collected are no longer enforceable by the Registrar.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 24A Registrar to register liability…, section 38 Variation of Register to have enforceable maintenance liability no longer enforced under Act, section 38A Election by payee or by payee and payer jointly


## Changes to the liability after an election to end agency collect


The Registrar may vary a liability after it has ended or ceased to be enforceable (agency collect). This commonly occurs when a parent lodges their tax return and the Registrar uses this information to reconcile the parent's income estimate (3.4) or to replace a provisional income (1.1.P.130).


If the Registrar varies a liability that accrued during an agency collect period, this can result in further unpaid amounts for that period. Child support arrears for an agency collect past period will be payable to the Registrar. However, the payee can elect for the Registrar not to collect any arrears arising from subsequent changes to the liability. The Registrar will explain to the payee the possible consequences of an election to end collection of amounts payable under a child support assessment based on a default income or estimate.


If the payee is in receipt of more than the base rate of FTB Part A, the payee should consider the implications for FTB of their election for the Registrar to end collection of arrears. See FA Guide3.1.6.70.


Example:Samuel and Madina, a payer and payee, jointly elect for the Registrar to end collection of child support. At the same time, they elect for the Registrar not to collect unpaid amounts. Samuel and Madina's assessment is based upon Samuel's estimate of taxable income. The Registrar gives effect to Samuel and Madina's election by specifying a terminating day, which is the date of Samuel and Madina's election and varies the Register to show that the overdue amounts are no longer payable to the Registrar.


Three months later, Samuel lodges his tax return. It shows that Samuel's actual taxable income was higher than his estimated income. The Registrar reconciles Samuel's estimate and increases Samuel and Madina's child support assessment. Samuel must pay extra child support to the Registrar for the days before the specified terminating day. Samuel and Madina can make their own arrangements for paying the extra child support for the specified terminating day and all subsequent days.

# 8.3.2.10 Notices to third parties to deduct child support


## Context


The Registrar can collect a relevant debt from a third party by issuing a CSRC Act section 72A notice or a section 72B notice.


See8.3.1for the definitions of 'relevant debt' and 'relevant debtor'. See8.3.2.20for more information on what funds which may be identified (or not) as owed to a relevant debtor.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person, section 72B Person receiving or …

• Which debts can be recovered?
• Effect of compliance or non-compliance
• Requirements of a section 72A notice
• Service of notices
• Payment made by relevant debtor
• Third party obligations when more than one notice received
• Collection within Australia where relevant debtor is outside Australia

## What is a section 72A notice?


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to any person who holds money for, or on behalf of, a relevant debtor, or to any person who may hold money for the relevant debtor in the future. A section 72A notice requires that person to pay the money to the Registrar. Notices are commonly used to collect money held in bank accounts and for the proceeds of property settlements (that is, house sale) which become due to the relevant debtor. The maximum notified deduction total is an amount specified in a section 72A notice that does not exceed the relevant debt of the relevant debtor to whom the notice relates.


A section 72A notice is similar to a garnishee (1.1.G.10) order obtained from a court by a creditor who has obtained judgment against a debtor. However, the Registrar does not need the approval of a court or to have obtained judgment prior to issuing a notice under section 72A. Notices under section 72A should not be issued on a speculative or 'fishing' basis.


A section 72A notice will require a third party to pay to the Registrar:

• an amount equal to the maximum notified deduction total (if a person holds more than the amount specified in the notice
• the amount of money being held (if the person holds an amount equal to, or less than, the maximum notified deduction total specified in the notice
• specified ongoing payments (if the person becomes liable, from time to time, to make payments to the debtor and the notice specifies an amount until the maximum notified deduction total is satisfied This allows the Registrar to collect from contractors who make payments to a subcontractor in a manner similar to a garnishee order made by a court.

A section 72A notice remains in force until complied with in full or it is withdrawn by the Registrar in writing.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person


## Which debts can be recovered?


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to recover:

• an overdue child support debt (1.1.C.90), including an amount equivalent to any child support (1.1.C.60) that the Registrar has already paid to the payee (1.1.P.30) from consolidated revenue because it was expected to have been remitted by the child support debtor's employer, but was not in fact deducted from the child support debtor's salary
• arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support that the Registrar has assessed for a prior period, but which are payable in the future
• carer debts (1.1.C.30) (see8.1.1for further information)
• aLPP(1.1.L.20) (see8.2for further information)
• an estimate penalty (3.4.5)
• any court-ordered costs payable to the Commonwealth in respect of an offence committed by a person under the CSRC Act or the CSA Act
• any amount ordered by a court, upon the conviction of a person for an offence against the CSRC Act or CSA Act, payable to the Registrar
• a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) which the Registrar has registered for collection as a child support debt.

The Registrar can also issue a section 72A notice to recover any child support due but not yet payable, however, the Registrar will only do so in special circumstances.


A section 72A notice cannot be used to recover other types of debts, such as:

• amounts of child support that may become due and payable in the future
• an employer's LPP (see7.4.3.20for further information)
• an employer's penalty for failure to make a deduction (see7.4.3.20for further information)
• employer penalties for unexplained remittances
• amounts under section 47(1) of the CSRC Act that have not been remitted by the employer by the due date.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person


## Effect of compliance or non-compliance


Any person who pays money to the Registrar as required by a notice under section 72A is taken to be acting under the authority of the relevant debtor and is indemnified for any monies paid to the Registrar.


A person who refuses or fails to comply with a notice without reasonable excuse is guilty of an offence and can be prosecuted. A fine up to 10 penalty units (see11.6.7for penalty unit amount) can be imposed on prosecution. 'Refuses or fails' simply means that a prosecution can commence if the person did not comply with the requirement after being served (or deemed to be served in the case of postal service). The offence occurs regardless of the intention of the person.


If a person is convicted of an offence under section 72A(2) of the CSRC Act, the court may also order the person convicted to pay the amount which the person refused or failed to pay under the notice. This has the dual purpose of encouraging compliance and protecting the interests of the receiving parent (1.1.P.10) entitled to the payment of the relevant debt.


The Registrar will credit any amount received from a third party in restitution for that third party's failure to comply with a section 72A notice to the relevant debtor's child support account. The Registrar will do so regardless of whether the third party makes this payment voluntarily, or in accordance with a court order. The Registrar will disburse to the receiving parent any amount of that restitution payment that represents unpaid relevant debts (but not LPPs or court costs) as if the relevant debtor paid the amount.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person


## Requirements of a section 72A notice


A section 72A notice must be in writing and specify a day by which the payment is to be made. The due date cannot be a date before the person holds money for a relevant debtor. This is a practical limitation on the power as although the Registrar can issue a notice to a person before they hold money for the relevant debtor, the Registrar cannot require the person to pay it before they actually hold it.


A section 72A notice is valid even if, at the time it is issued, no funds are held by the third party.


Example:The Registrar may be aware that a payment is expected to be deposited into a particular bank account. A notice issued to the bank should specify a date by which the payment must be made (usually within 7 days of the money becoming due to the debtor or held for the debtor). The notice is valid until this day, even though the bank cannot comply with the notice when it is issued because the account is empty. The bank is under an obligation to monitor that account until the date for payment arrives, any deposits to the account before that date are subject to the payment order in the notice, up to a maximum notified deduction total stated in the notice.


If the Registrar wants to extend the date by which payment is to be made under a section 72A notice, the previous notice should be withdrawn in writing and a new notice issued showing the new date, and an update of the amount payable if necessary.


A section 72A notice for wages or contract payments must not require deductions to the extent that they prevent the relevant debtor from meeting reasonable living expenses (Geoffrey Walter Edelsten v Charles Robert Wilcox and Commissioner of Taxation(1988) FCA 204). The Registrar must consider the whole of the debtor's financial position and make an allowance for the debtor's ordinary living expenses, unless there are extraordinary circumstances.


The Registrar must give a copy of a section 72A notice to the relevant debtor. The Registrar will do this by posting a copy of the notice to the relevant debtor at their last known address.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person


CSRC Regssection 31 to section 35 Service of notices etc.


## Service of notices


The Registrar must serve the notice on the third party. The requirements for service are discussed in11.5.


## Payment made by relevant debtor


If a relevant debtor pays their relevant debt after the Registrar serves a section 72A notice upon a person, the Registrar must give immediate written notice of the payment to the person served with the notice.


## Third party obligations when more than one notice received


If a person receives a section 72A notice from the Registrar and a statutory notice from another Commonwealth, state or territory authority, both instructing the person to pay an amount of money they are holding for or on behalf of the debtor, the general rule is that notices are complied with in the order they were received by the person. If a statutory notice issued to the person is later varied, for example, by instructing the person to pay a different amount, the priority given to each notice will not change.


If a person receives a section 72A notice from the Registrar and a Commonwealth, state or territory court order, both instructing the person to pay an amount of money they are holding for or on behalf of the debtor, the notice from the Registrar will take priority over the court order, regardless of the order in which the person receives the garnishee order or notice.


Third parties should contact Services Australia for advice if they are unsure of their obligations in relation to multiple garnishee notices.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from a third person


## Collection within Australia where relevant debtor is outside Australia


The Registrar can serve a section 72A notice upon a person within Australia who controls money for a relevant debtor outside Australia. However, section 72A notices are restricted in their operation and only apply to amounts already due to the Registrar.


The Registrar also can issue a notice under section 72B of the CSRC Act upon a person within Australia who controls money for a relevant debtor outside Australia. However, a section 72B notice can be used to collect current amounts of child support before they become overdue.


A section 72B notice can be issued when the relevant debtor is not physically present in Australia and:

• derives income, profit or capital gains from a source in Australia, or
• is a shareholder, debenture holder or depositor in a company that derives income, profit or capital gains from a source in Australia.

If these criteria apply, the Registrar can serve a section 72B notice upon any third person who receives, controls or disposes of any of the relevant debtor's money.


When issued with a section 72B notice by the Registrar, the person must pay the relevant debt of the relevant debtor. Further, the section 72B notice may require the person to retain enough money, that comes to them on behalf of the relevant debtor, to pay the relevant debt or any amount that may become payable by the debtor as a child support debt.


A section 72B notice is not effective against money derived from certain natural resource payments or royalty payments.


Like a section 72A notice, a section 72B notice must specify the amount the person is required to retain and send to the Registrar, and the due date for payment.

# 8.3.2.20 What fund can be attached?


## Context


A section 72A notice (CSRC Act) (8.3.2.10) is only effective where funds can be identified as owed to a relevant debtor and there is nothing that prevents the operation of the notice.


See below for examples of the types of funds against which a section 72A notice may or may not be issued.


## On this page

• Joint bank accounts
• Company bank accounts
• Credit card accounts
• Term deposits
• Trust accounts & trust property
• Partnership funds
• Share dividends & company director fees of a company
• Deposits held by real estate agents & proceeds of a property sale
• Mortgage offset account
• Excess funds paid onto a loan
• Solicitor liens
• Superannuation funds
• Life insurance
• Income protection insurance
• Veterans’ Affairs pensions & compensation payments
• Social security payments
• National Disability Insurance Scheme payments
• National Redress Scheme payments

• Inalienable benefits or payments in a bank account
• Commonwealth inscribed stock or bearer securities
• Traveller’s cheques, foreign currency, shares, gold
• Money held by a court
• Payments to taxi drivers
• Money payable to a bankrupt.

## Joint bank accounts


A notice under section 72A cannot be effective against a joint bank account because it is not possible to identify any portion as belonging solely to one owner (Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Westpac Savings Bank Ltd(1987) ATC 4346).


## Company bank accounts


Funds held in a bank account that is in the name of a company are held by the company as a legal person, not by the relevant debtor. The funds in such an account cannot be said to be payable to the relevant debtor, even if the relevant debtor is the sole signatory to the account or the sole director or shareholder of the company.


## Credit card accounts


Under certain contractual arrangements, positive credit balances on credit card accounts can be considered to be money held by the financial institution for or on account of the cardholder and therefore recoverable under a section 72A notice. Where there is any doubt, the Registrar should request and examine the contractual arrangement to determine whether the balance is money due, or held for, the relevant debtor. This will depend on the specific contractual arrangements between the financial institution and the debtor. These arrangements vary from one financial institution to another, as does the way in which the financial institution treats any credit balance.


## Term deposits


The Registrar can collect payment from a person's term deposit through a section 72A notice where the terms and conditions of the term deposit allow for the person to be paid the monies prior to the maturity date (that is, they are repayable upon demand) (CSRC Act section 72A(12),Macquarie Health Corp Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation(1999) FCA 1819).


## Trust accounts & trust property


If a relevant debtor is a trustee of funds held in a bank account, a section 72A notice issued to the bank in relation to those funds will not be effective. A trustee holds the trust funds for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries) and does not own the funds for their own use. The same applies to a relevant debtor who holds trust property.


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to a trustee who holds money in trust for a relevant debtor. That notice will only be effective when the trust deed authorises the trustee to make a distribution or payment to the relevant debtor from the trust funds or from the sale of the trust property.


## Partnership funds


Funds held by a partnership are held jointly by the members of the partnership. However, it is possible to serve a section 72A notice on a partner in relation to any distribution that they may make to the other partner/debtor.


## Share dividends & company director fees of a company


If a relevant debtor is a director or a shareholder of a company, a section 72A notice can be issued on the company for a percentage of any distribution made to the relevant debtor. When the company distributes a dividend to the relevant debtor (where the relevant debtor is a shareholder) or director's fees (where the relevant debtor is a director) the notice should be complied with.


## Deposits held by real estate agents & proceeds of a property sale


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to a real estate agent for funds held as a deposit against the sale of a property by the relevant debtor.


The deposit remains the property of the purchaser until the sale of the property is finalised. Once the sale of the property is finalised, the notice will not be effective against any portion of the funds that are to be retained by the real estate agent for payment of fees due to the real estate agent under contractual arrangements existing between the agent and the relevant debtor (as vendor of the property). The agent will only be required to remit to the Registrar any amount that would ordinarily be transferred to the relevant debtor.


The Registrar can also issue a section 72A notice to a relevant debtor's solicitor for any amounts that the solicitor may receive or that are held by the solicitor on behalf of the relevant debtor (vendor) from the proceeds of a property sale. The notice will be effective against the portion of the proceeds due to the payer (after the solicitor has distributed the sale proceeds including fees subject to a solicitor's lien or discharge of mortgage.)


## Mortgage offset account


A mortgage offset account is a savings account linked to a loan account. The amount in the savings account is offset against the amount owing on the mortgage.


A section 72A notice is effective if the terms and conditions of a mortgage offset account allow the relevant debtor to access the funds held in the account and there are funds available. Before issuing the notice, the whole of the debtor's financial circumstances must be considered. The debtor must be allowed ordinary living expenses and the notice must not cause a default to occur on the debtor's regular loan repayments.


## Excess funds paid onto a loan


A person who has paid more than the minimum rate towards their mortgage or personal loan may later redraw those extra funds. Redrawing excess funds creates a new loan from the lender to the relevant debtor. Therefore, a section 72A notice cannot be issued for those extra funds because the lender is not holding the funds for, or on behalf of, the relevant debtor.


## Solicitor liens


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to a solicitor for funds held in trust for a relevant debtor who is that solicitor's client. The notice will not be effective against any portion of the funds that are subject to a solicitor's lien for work performed and disbursements paid on behalf of their client. A solicitor's lien creates a charge over the funds once the solicitor has delivered their bill of costs to the client (or if the client objects to the bill, when the costs are taxed) (Gilshenan & Luton v Federal Commissioner of Taxation(1983) ATC 4758).


## Superannuation funds


A section 72A notice may not be effective against pensions or lump sums paid by a superannuation fund or in relation to funds held. It will depend on the particular fund and the status of the money held.


### Does the fund have a specific exemption from compliance?


Some superannuation funds were established by legislation that provides a specific exemption from compliance with garnishee (1.1.G.10) notices.


Superannuation Act 1976section 118 specifically precludes garnishee action on any type of pension or other benefit under this Act (Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pensions paid to former Commonwealth public servants).


Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948section 85, andDefence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973section 129 will not allow section 72A notices to be attached to benefits payable under these Acts.


### Funds that are not specifically exempt from compliance


A superannuation fund holds superannuation money on trust for the benefit of its members (that is, the contributors). As a general rule a superannuation fund will be required to comply with a section 72A notice where the member has access to the funds (that is, when the funds are 'due and payable' to the relevant debtor).


### Are the benefits payable to the member?


The rules that apply to all superannuation funds when determining whether or not the benefits are actually payable to the member are as follows:

• Unrestricted non-preserved amounts

Unrestricted non-preserved amounts of superannuation are benefits which the member can make an election to have paid out immediately. A section 72A notice should not be issued to the fund unless and until the member has made an election for payment. Once the election is made, the funds that have been nominated for payment will be considered 'due and payable' and a section 72A notice will be effective.

• Other amounts

Where the funds are not available (preserved amounts) or other conditions are not met (restricted non-preserved amounts), a section 72A notice will not be effective. In such cases, section 72A(12) of the CSRC Act cannot overcome the legal requirement for the contributor to qualify to access those funds (for example, by age or retirement). The notice will not be effective unless and until the debtor-member's benefits are payable to the debtor under the rules of the fund (for example, by retirement).


### Deceased member benefits


A superannuation fund holds superannuation money on trust for the benefit of its members (the beneficiary). If the member dies, the superannuation fund no longer holds the money on trust for the member. If the money is preserved, it is usually paid as a death benefit to the member's dependants or legal personal representative, in accordance with superannuation law and the superannuation trust deed.


If the superannuation trustee decides to pay the death benefit to the deceased person's dependants, the beneficial ownership of the money passes to the dependants from the time of the member's death (even though the decision about the person/s to whom the money will be paid may not be made until after this date). The superannuation fund will no longer hold money for, or on account of, a relevant debtor and a section 72A notice will not be effective.


If the superannuation trustee decides to pay the death benefit to the member's legal personal representative, the superannuation becomes an asset of the deceased person's estate from the time of the member's death (even though the decision about the person/s to whom the money will be paid may not be made until after this date). The superannuation fund will no longer be holding money for, or on account of, a relevant debtor; the money is 'not due and payable' to the relevant debtor and a section 72A notice will not be effective. However, the Registrar will seek to recover any outstanding debt from the person's estate.


### Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS) & Public Sector Superannuation (PSS) benefits administered by Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC)


For MSBS and PSS members, the Registrar can issue a notice to collect relevant debts via employer withholding or garnishee and notices under these provisions should be complied with by the trustee (CSC).


### Employer withholding of superannuation funds


If a section 72A notice can be effective against a pension paid by a superannuation fund, it may be possible to apply employer withholding (7.4.3) as an alternative.


## Life insurance


Section 205 of theLife Insurance Act 1995applies upon the death of an insured person. It protects money that would be payable under a life insurance policy to the insured person's estate, preventing it from being applied to pay that person's debts. Without the express direction of the deceased person, any order, judgment, or process of any court, executor or administrator, etc. is ineffective against the funds.


In any event, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is often not the insured person's estate, but a nominated person, for example, the person's spouse. When the insured person dies, the funds are payable directly to the nominated person.


## Income protection insurance


Income protection insurance is general insurance and not life insurance. A section 72A notice may be issued to an insurance company in respect of any money due to the relevant debtor under an income protection insurance policy.


## Veterans' Affairs pensions & compensation payments


The Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot comply with a section 72A notice requiring it to deduct an amount from pensions paid under theVeterans' Entitlements Act 1986, as these pensions are 'absolutely inalienable' (Veterans' Entitlements Act section 125(1)). However, these payments will lose their inalienability once they are deposited into a bank account.


A section 72A notice can be issued to the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to compensation payments paid under theMilitary Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004(Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act) or theSafety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988(Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act).


In addition, a written notice may be issued to the Department of Veterans' Affairs under section 72AC of the CSRC Act, which provides for deductions from specified veterans' pensions and allowances.


## Social security payments


The SSAct and the SS(Admin)Act prevent the Secretary from withholding a parent's entitlements to a pension, allowance or benefit paid under the SSAct for the purposes of child support, except where section 72AA of the CSRC Act applies.


However, section 72A notices may be issued to the Secretary requiring deductions to be made fromABSTUDYpayments. The Registrar has undertaken to limit deductions from ABSTUDY payments to the amount prescribed for the purposes of section 72AA.


## National Disability Insurance Scheme payments


The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides support for people with permanent and significant disability. NDIS payments may be made to an NDIS participant, their nominee, or to a registered plan provider, to fund the purchase of supports identified in the participant's plan. These payments are not a financial resource that is available to meet a relevant debt, and the Registrar should not issue a section 72A notice to recover relevant debts from an NDIS specific bank account. This applies whether or not the participant is self-managing their supports or if the funds are being managed on behalf of an NDIS participant.


However, where a person receives payments to provide care or support for an NDIS participant, these payments are treated as employment income and a section 72A notice may be issued to the financial institution where the payments are deposited.


## National Redress Scheme payments


The National Redress Scheme was implemented in response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. A person's entitlement to a redress payment and the payment itself are inalienable, and the Registrar should not issue a section 72A notice to recover relevant debts from redress payments.


## Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme payments


The Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme is a financial and wellbeing package for Stolen Generations survivors who were removed as children from their family or community in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory prior to self-government, or the Jervis Bay Territory (collectively known as the territories).


The Scheme seeks to recognise the harm and trauma experienced by Stolen Generations survivors.


A payment under the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme is inalienable. The Registrar should not issue a section 72A notice to recover relevant debts from Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme payments.


## Status Resolution Support Services Program payments


The Status Resolution Support Services (SRSS) Program provides needs-based support and assistance to eligible asylum seekers and other non-citizens as they seek to resolve their immigration status and as they transition to mainstream services in the Australian community or make preparations to depart Australia once their immigration status has been resolved. The Registrar should not issue a section 72A notice to recover relevant debts from SRSS Program payments due to the purpose of the payment and the potential financial hardship that may be caused by garnisheeing the payment.


Once a SRSS payment is deposited into a bank account, it is treated in the same way as other funds in the bank account. Therefore, a section 72A notice issued to a financial institution that holds SRSS Program payments on account of a relevant debtor will be effective, provided those amounts are due and payable to the relevant debtor, regardless of the original source of those funds.


## Inalienable benefits or payments in a bank account


### Benefits or payments in a bank account that cease to be inalienable


Once inalienable benefits (such as Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions or social security pensions, benefits or allowances) are deposited in an account, the funds cease to be inalienable. Therefore, a section 72A notice issued to a financial institution that holds money on account of a relevant debtor will be effective, provided those amounts are due and payable to the relevant debtor, regardless of the original source of those funds.


NDIS amounts are also inalienable (National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013) and cease to be inalienable once deposited into a bank account. However, as noted above, the Registrar should not issue a section 72A notice to recover relevant debts from an NDIS specific bank account.


### Payments in a bank account that remain inalienable


Payments under the National Redress Scheme and the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme received by child support parents are inalienable, and remain inalienable after being paid into a bank account. A section 72A notice issued under the CSRC Act should not be issued in relation to the redress payment component of the survivor's bank account.


## Commonwealth inscribed stock or bearer securities


Section 72A notices should not be issued to the Registrar of Inscribed Stock as the registrar is not a 'person'.


## Traveller's cheques, foreign currency, shares, gold


A section 72A notice cannot be effective against a third party who holds traveller's cheques, foreign currency, shares or gold for a relevant debtor. This is because these things are commodities and are not 'money'.


## Money held by a court


The Registrar cannot issue a section 72A notice to a court, as a court is not a 'person' (Clyne v DFC of T (1983) ATC 4007). The Registrar cannot therefore require a court to pay any amounts lodged by the relevant debtor for bail monies, etc.


## Payments to taxi drivers


The Registrar can issue a section 72A notice to a taxi owner requiring them to deduct amounts from payments they make to a contracted or employed driver. However, a section 72A notice will not be effective against a taxi cooperative from which a taxi driver hires their cab. A cooperative does not usually pay wages, fees or contract payments to a driver.


## Money payable to a bankrupt


A section 72A notice issued in respect of money payable by a third party to a bankrupt person will only be effective if the amount claimed does not come within the scope of the bankrupt's estate managed by the trustee. For more information on the effect of bankruptcy, see8.3.4.

# 8.3.3.10 Departure prohibition orders (DPO)


## Context


The Registrar can make aDPO(1.1.D.50) preventing a person who has a child support debt (1.1.C.90) or carer debt (1.1.C.30) from leaving Australia. A person subject to a DPO can apply for aDAC(1.1.D.30) (8.3.3.20). A DAC allows the person to depart Australia for a specified period.

## What is a DPO?


The Registrar has the power to make a DPO to prevent a person who has persistently failed to pay their child support liability or carer liability from leaving Australia without either discharging all debts or making satisfactory arrangements to do so (seeWhittaker v Child Support Registrar(2010) FCA 43for case law regarding the purpose of DPOs).


A DPO places significant restrictions on the freedom of movement of citizens and residents of Australia (1.1.R.100) and visitors to Australia and will not be made without consideration of all relevant circumstances. A DPO does not prohibit travel to Australia's external territories (for example, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island).


Where a DPO is in force, the Registrar can vary or revoke the DPO, or can issue a DAC. The CSRC Act provides appeal and review rights in relation to DPOs and DACs.


The Registrar has delegated certain senior department officers to exercise powers and functions in relation to DPOs. See11.1.2for further information about delegations.


Act reference:CSRC ActPart VA—Departure prohibition orders


## Criteria for making a DPO


The Registrar has discretion to make a DPO where all of 4 specified conditions are satisfied:

• the relevant person has a child support liability or carer liability
• the relevant person has not made satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge the liability
• the Registrar is satisfied that the relevant person has persistently and without reasonable grounds failed to pay child support debts (as distinct from spousal maintenance debts) or a carer liability
• the Registrar believes it is desirable to make such an order to ensure that the person does not leave Australia without wholly discharging the child support liability or carer liability, or making satisfactory arrangements to do so.

While Australia has reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of child support liabilities with a range of foreign jurisdictions, a person's travel destination is not a relevant factor for the Registrar to take into consideration when exercising the discretion to issue a DPO.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72D Registrar may make departure prohibition orders


### The relevant person has a child support liability or a carer liability


A person has a child support liability if:

• they have a registrable maintenance liability of the following kind
• a child support assessment (1.1.C.70)
• a liability to pay periodic child maintenance arising from a court order or court registered maintenance agreement or a collection agency maintenance liability
• a liability arising from a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7) or
• a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) (but not a spousal maintenance liability),
• the liability is payable to the Registrar (that is, it is a debt due to the Commonwealth under CSRC Act section 30) and at least part of the debt remains unpaid past the date it was due for payment.

A person has a carer liability if they owe a carer debt (overpayment) under CSRC Act section 69B (8.1.1).

### The relevant person has not made satisfactory arrangements


The Registrar must consider whether the person has made satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge the debt.


What constitutes a satisfactory arrangement will depend on the facts of the case. If a satisfactory arrangement is in place, the Registrar cannot make a DPO.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72D(1)(b) Registrar may make departure prohibition orders


### The Registrar is satisfied that the relevant person has persistently & without reasonable grounds failed to pay their debt


The Registrar will not make a DPO unless satisfied that the person's failure to pay their debt is both persistent and without reasonable grounds.


In considering the meaning of persistence in this context, the Registrar must be satisfied that the person has taken deliberate and repetitive or sustained action to avoid paying their debt. The Registrar must have regard to a number of factors when forming a view that the person's actions (or inaction) amount to persistent behaviour without reasonable grounds. The specific factors are:

• the person's capacity to pay the debt or debtsIf the person genuinely has no capacity to pay the debt, their failure to pay cannot be regarded as persistent and without reasonable grounds.The Registrar will take into account the person's statements and evidence about their financial position and any findings in relation to ability to pay.The Registrar will expect a person to use all available options to ensure the liability is correct and appropriate to their circumstances before claiming inability to pay the debt.The Registrar is not restricted to considering the person's capacity to pay on the day that the DPO is to be issued. The Registrar is entitled to consider the person's capacity to pay the liability during the period they failed to pay the debt.
• If the person genuinely has no capacity to pay the debt, their failure to pay cannot be regarded as persistent and without reasonable grounds.
• The Registrar will take into account the person's statements and evidence about their financial position and any findings in relation to ability to pay.
• The Registrar will expect a person to use all available options to ensure the liability is correct and appropriate to their circumstances before claiming inability to pay the debt.
• The Registrar is not restricted to considering the person's capacity to pay on the day that the DPO is to be issued. The Registrar is entitled to consider the person's capacity to pay the liability during the period they failed to pay the debt.
• the number of occasions on which action has been taken to recover such debts, and the outcome of the recovery actionIf the Registrar has taken no action (legal or administrative) to recover the debt, persistence is not present.Unsuccessful action may suggest that the person does not have the ability to pay the debt, but this is not to be regarded as conclusive evidence.
• If the Registrar has taken no action (legal or administrative) to recover the debt, persistence is not present.
• Unsuccessful action may suggest that the person does not have the ability to pay the debt, but this is not to be regarded as conclusive evidence.
• the number of occasions a debt was not paid by the due date (if the outstanding debt is for periodic child support)where the person has child support arrears from one periodic payment that was not paid on time, andthere is no other significant history of late payment, persistence is not present, orthere is a significant history of late payment, persistence may be present if the other relevant factors are satisfiedwhere the person has child support arrears from a number of periodic payments which were not paid on time, persistence may be present if the other relevant factors are satisfied
• where the person has child support arrears from one periodic payment that was not paid on time, andthere is no other significant history of late payment, persistence is not present, orthere is a significant history of late payment, persistence may be present if the other relevant factors are satisfied
• there is no other significant history of late payment, persistence is not present, or
• there is a significant history of late payment, persistence may be present if the other relevant factors are satisfied
• where the person has child support arrears from a number of periodic payments which were not paid on time, persistence may be present if the other relevant factors are satisfied
• the length of time the debt has been unpaid after the due date (if the outstanding debt arises from a recovery order or a carer liability)
• such other matters as the Registrar considers appropriate.These matters are not defined, and relate to the circumstances of the particular case.Officers considering whether to make a DPO may consider other relevant factors, but must clearly document the factor, its relevance to the decision, and the impact it has on the decision.
• These matters are not defined, and relate to the circumstances of the particular case.
• Officers considering whether to make a DPO may consider other relevant factors, but must clearly document the factor, its relevance to the decision, and the impact it has on the decision.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72D(1)(c) and section 72D(2) Registrar may make departure prohibition orders


### The Registrar believes it is desirable to make a DPO


The purpose of a DPO is to secure payment of a child support debt or a carer debt.


The Registrar will not make a DPO unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that making the order will make payment of the debt more likely.


If a person with a debt is about to leave Australia (regardless of any plans to return) the Registrar will consider whether to make a DPO. The Registrar will generally make a DPO if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person has the ability to discharge their liability, and is either:

• likely to fail to return to Australia without discharging their liability or making satisfactory arrangements to do so, or
• likely to discharge their liability or make satisfactory arrangements to do so if a DPO is made.

A DPO may be appropriate if the person:

• is transferring assets offshore, either directly or indirectly, for example, borrowing funds overseas using Australian assets as security
• has resources (whether financial or otherwise) that would enable them to live offshore, for example, family, assets, employment or a business
• is likely to discharge the debt or make satisfactory arrangements for discharge of the debt if a DPO is made.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72D(1)(d) Registrar may make departure prohibition orders


## Revoking a DPO


Once a DPO is made, the Registrar must revoke it in certain circumstances and may revoke or vary it in other circumstances. The Registrar can revoke or vary a DPO in response to representations made by the person with the debt or because of the Registrar becoming aware of new information.


### When the Registrar must revoke a DPO


The Registrar must revoke a DPO when both of the following 2 tests are satisfied.


The first test has 2 alternative parts. Either:

• the child support liability or carer liability has been wholly discharged or satisfactory arrangements have been made to discharge the debt,
• the Registrar is satisfied that the child support liability or carer liability is completely irrecoverable.

If either of these conditions is present, the first test is satisfied.


The second test applies to any future child support liability or carer liability. It also has 2 alternative parts. Either:

• the Registrar is satisfied that any child support liability or carer liability to which the person may become subject in respect of, or arising out of, matters that have already occurred will be wholly discharged or that satisfactory arrangements will be made to discharge those liabilities,
• the Registrar is satisfied that any such child support liability or carer liability will be completely irrecoverable.

If either of these conditions is present, the second test is satisfied.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


### Wholly discharged


A debt is wholly discharged when no part of it remains owing. A child support debt or carer debt can be wholly discharged either by payment of the debt or by an administrative or judicial process that decreases the amount of the debt to nil. Where either or both of these processes result in no part of the debt remaining payable, the debt is wholly discharged. A debt which is considered to be uneconomic to pursue is not wholly discharged.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I(1)(a) Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


### Satisfactory arrangements


Arrangements that lead the Registrar to be satisfied that the debt will be wholly discharged are satisfactory arrangements. A common sense approach is required to determine whether arrangements are satisfactory in each case. A payment arrangement that effectively requires the person to be present in Australia to function is not a satisfactory arrangement. Where the person has sold property and needs to leave Australia before settlement occurs, a section 72A of CSRC Act notice (8.3.2) in relation to the known proceeds would be a satisfactory arrangement.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I(1)(b) Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


### Completely irrecoverable


A debt will be regarded as completely irrecoverable when there is no prospect that the person will be able to make any payment towards it.


A high threshold must be satisfied to prove that a debt is completely irrecoverable.


Example:Where a debtor has not received any income from work or income support payments for more than 10 years, their debt will not be regarded as completely irrecoverable if it is possible that they could obtain work or financial assistance at some time in the future to meet at least part of the debt (Naboush and Child Support Registrar(2014) AATA 930).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I(1)(c) Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


### When the Registrar may revoke a DPO


Even where the tests outlined above are not satisfied, a DPO may be revoked where the Registrar considers it desirable to do so. The Registrar will exercise this discretion in a way that supports the objects of the CSRC Act.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I(3) Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


## Varying a DPO


The Registrar also has discretion to vary a DPO. The Registrar will only vary a DPO to correct errors on the face of the order.


The Registrar will not use the discretion to vary a DPO to allow the person to depart Australia. Where the Registrar is satisfied that it is appropriate and necessary for the person to leave Australia for a specified period, the Registrar will either revoke the DPO or issue a DAC.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72I(3) Revocation and variation of departure prohibition orders


## Notification requirements relating to DPOs


Where the Registrar makes a DPO in respect of a person, the Registrar must notify:

• the person to whom the order applies
• the Australian Border Force
• the Australian Federal Police, and
• where the person is not an Australian citizen, the Department of Home Affairs.

In light of the consequences to a person subject to a DPO, the Registrar will make every effort to ensure that the person receives a copy of the DPO as soon as possible after it is made. This means that even where the Registrar is unable to be certain of the current contact details for the person, a copy of the DPO will be sent to the most recent address known to the Registrar.


Australian Customs Officers and members of the Australian Federal Police are authorised to prevent the overseas departure of a person subject to a DPO.


The person subject to the order, and any other person to whom a copy of the order was provided, must be notified if the Registrar makes a decision to vary or revoke a DPO.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72G Notification requirements for departure prohibition orders, section 72J Notification of decisions about revocation and variation, section 72U Powers of authorised officers


## Offences


It is an offence for a person to depart from Australia for a foreign country if:

• a DPO in respect of the person is in force, and the person knows, or is reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and
• the person's departure is not authorised by a DAC, and the person knows, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by a DAC.

See8.3.3.20for information on DACs.


An attempt to commit any of these offences is punishable as though the actual offence had been committed.


Any offences are likely to be detected by members of the Australian Federal Police or Customs Officers, rather than Services Australia staff. The Registrar will give whatever assistance is necessary for the successful prosecution of any offences detected.

# 8.3.3.30 Reviews & appeals of DPO & DAC decisions


## Context


Certain decisions relating to aDPO(1.1.D.50) orDAC(1.1.D.30) can be reviewed by theART(1.1.A.40) or appealed to court.


## On this page

• Internal review mechanisms
• Review by the ART
• Appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia or the Federal Court of Australia

## Internal review mechanisms


There are no internal objection (1.1.O.10) rights in relation to DPOs (8.3.3.10) or DACs (8.3.3.20).


A debtor subject to a DPO may apply to Services Australia to have it revoked or varied. These applications are not an avenue for review of the original decision and are to be decided on the basis of facts in existence at the time the decision on the application is being made.


A debtor subject to a DPO may apply to Services Australia for the issue of a DAC. These applications are not an avenue for review of the original decision and are to be decided on the basis of facts in existence at the time the decision on the application is being made.


There is nothing to prevent a debtor making applications for the revocation of or variation to a DPO subsequent to an unsuccessful application. Each such application will be dealt with on its merits in the light of the facts prevailing at the time a decision is made.


## Review by the ART


The following decisions made by the Registrar are subject to review by the ART:

• to refuse to revoke or vary a DPO
• to vary a DPO
• to issue or refuse to issue a DAC
• the provision of security, and
• the substitution of later days on a DAC.

The ART will undertake an independent merits review of the decision. The ART can exercise the discretions granted to the Registrar when reviewing decisions.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72T Applications for review of certain decisions


## Appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia or the Federal Court of Australia


A person aggrieved by the making of a DPO can appeal to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) or the Federal Court of Australia against the making of the order. The court can either dismiss the application or set aside the DPO. The court can determine whether an order is properly made, but cannot exercise the administrative decision-making powers granted to the Registrar (T v Federal Commissioner of Taxation(1986) FCA 433).


While the CSRC Act provides jurisdiction for the court to make certain stay orders, these provisions to not permit the court to make an order staying the operation of a DPO.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72Q Appeals to courts against making of departure prohibition orders, section 111C Stay orders


## Offences


It is an offence for a person to depart from Australia for a foreign country if:

• a DPO in respect of the person is in force, and the person knows, or is reckless as to whether, a DPO is in force, and
• the person's departure is not authorised by a DAC, and the person knows, or is reckless as to whether the departure is authorised by a DAC.

An attempt to commit any of these offences is punishable as though the actual offence had been committed.


Any offences are likely to be detected by members of the Australian Federal Police or Customs Officers, rather than Services Australia staff. The Registrar will give whatever assistance is necessary for the successful prosecution of any offences detected.

# 8.3.3.20 Departure authorisation certificates (DAC)


## Context


A person subject to aDPO(1.1.D.50) (8.3.3.10) can apply for aDAC(1.1.D.30) which allows the person to depart Australia for a specified period.


## On this page

• When the Registrar must issue a DAC
• DAC where the person is likely to depart and return, revocation likely, and security not necessary
• DAC where revocation likely and security provided
• An appropriate period
• DAC issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia’s interests
• Date of issue of a DAC
• Notification requirements relating to DACs

## When the Registrar must issue a DAC


The Registrar must issue a DAC in situations where:

• the person is likely to depart and return to Australia within a specified period, it is likely that the Registrar will be required to revoke the DPO within a period the Registrar considers appropriate, and security for the debtor's return to Australia is not necessary
• it is likely that the Registrar will be required to revoke the DPO within a period the Registrar considers appropriate, and the person has provided appropriate security for their return to Australia by a specified date, or
• the Registrar is satisfied a DAC should be issued on humanitarian grounds or that refusing to issue a DAC will be detrimental to Australia's interests.

There is no discretion to issue a DAC in other situations.


Where a DAC has been issued, a copy of that certificate must be provided for inspection, if requested by an authorised officer, when departing Australia.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72K Application for departure authorisation certificate, section 72L When Registrar must issue departure authorisation certificate, section 72W Certain people must produce authority to depart


## DAC where the person is likely to depart & return, revocation likely, & security not necessary


The Registrar is required to issue a DAC when satisfied that:

• if the DAC is issued, it is likely that the person will depart from Australia and return within an appropriate period
• if the DAC is issued, it is likely that the Registrar will be required to revoke the DPO, and
• it is not necessary for the person to give security for their return to Australia.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72L(2) When Registrar must issue departure authorisation certificate


## DAC where revocation likely & security provided


If the Registrar is not satisfied that the 3 requirements above have been met, a DAC may still be issued if the Registrar would likely be required to revoke the DPO within a period that the Registrar considers appropriate, and the person has given appropriate security for their return to Australia.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72L(3) When Registrar must issue departure authorisation certificate, section 72M Security for person’s return to Australia


## An appropriate period


The factors the Registrar must consider in determining what an appropriate period is include:

• the amount of the debt
• the person’s capacity to pay the debt (including the rate of repayment over time)
• any administrative or judicial decisions that may affect the amount of the debt, and
• any other factors the Registrar considers appropriate.

Example:A person subject to a DPO seeks a DAC to permit their travel overseas for work. The person offers security for their return to Australia and makes arrangements to pay the debt in instalments upon their return to Australia. The Registrar is satisfied that the payment arrangement will result in the debt being wholly discharged within an appropriate period and would therefore be required to revoke the DPO. The Registrar accepts the person’s security and issues a DAC allowing the person to travel for the specified period.


Example:A person subject to a DPO seeks a DAC to permit travel overseas to visit family members. The person offers security for their return to Australia and makes arrangements to pay their significant child support debt in instalments upon their return to Australia. The arrangement would wholly discharge the debt in 5 years. Given the person’s financial circumstances, and the amount of time it would take to wholly discharge the debt under the arrangement, the Registrar is not satisfied that they would be likely required to revoke the DPO within an appropriate period. The Registrar therefore does not issue a DAC to permit the person’s travel.


Security can be given by a bond or a deposit or by other means. If the person does not return by the agreed date, the security will be forfeited to the Commonwealth of Australia. It cannot be applied against the outstanding debt.


The Registrar will only accept a security that:

• is in a form that is readily convertible to cash, for example, bank cheque
• is offered by the debtor rather than third parties on the debtor's behalf
• is generally not significantly less in value than the amount of the debt owing.

Note:Security arising from a loan obtained from a financial institution or a third party is not considered to be a payment from a third party.


Note:A charge over real estate would not generally be considered to be an appropriate form of security.


The Registrar is not required to issue a DAC even if security is offered if the Registrar is not satisfied that the person has made satisfactory arrangements to wholly discharge the debt (and the debt is not completely irrecoverable).


Example:A person subject to a DPO notifies the Registrar that they wish to leave Australia and seeks a DAC permitting travel for a specified period. The person does not make any arrangements to pay the debt but offers a cash security for their return to Australia. The Registrar is not satisfied that revocation of the DPO would be required because it is unlikely that the debt will be wholly discharged when the person returns to Australia. The Registrar therefore does not accept the security and refuses to issue a DAC.


If a person is able to give appropriate security, the use of those funds to reduce the debt is preferred to their use as a security. Wholly discharging the debt or making a satisfactory arrangement to discharge the debt and meet any ongoing child support (1.1.C.60) liability will generally require the Registrar to revoke the DPO.


Where the debt is in dispute and a person is taking steps to resolve this dispute, offering security could be an appropriate alternative. The Registrar may change the day specified in the DAC to a later day where the DAC has been issued with security for a person's return to Australia.


The date of return for a DAC may be extended upon application or initiated by the Registrar. The application can be made verbally or in writing.


An application to substitute a later date may be successful on the same security if the Registrar is satisfied with the current level of security.


The Registrar may refuse an application to substitute a later date for the person's return if:

• the person refuses to increase the value of security already given
• the person refuses to give such further security as the Registrar considers appropriate, or
• the Registrar considers that it would not be appropriate to substitute a later day for the person's return to Australia.

Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72L(2)(a)(i) When Registrar must issue departure authorisation certificate, section 72M Security for person’s return to Australia


## DAC issued on humanitarian grounds or in Australia's interests


The Registrar must issue a DAC where satisfied that:

• the certificate should be issued on humanitarian grounds, or
• refusing to issue the certificate would be detrimental to Australia's interests,
• the debtor is unable to provide security for their return to Australia.

In considering the meaning of 'unable' in this context, the Registrar must be satisfied that the debtor could not, in the existing circumstances, provide appropriate security. It is not sufficient that the debtor is merely unwilling to provide security or unable to satisfy the Registrar as to the appropriateness of the security offered (Lui and Commissioner of Taxation(2009) AATA 626at paragraph 21). The onus is on the debtor to establish the inability to provide appropriate security.


Humanitarian grounds include compassionate grounds.


Example:Where the certificate is required to enable the debtor to visit sick relatives (as supported by evidence) and the Registrar is satisfied that the debtor is unable to provide security, the issue of a certificate may be justified (Crockett and Commissioner of Taxation(1998) AATA 1033; 41 ATR 1164; 99 ATC 2218).


Example:Where a debtor requests a DAC on humanitarian grounds to visit sick relatives but the medical evidence provided does not sufficiently demonstrate genuine or credible health issues, the request to issue a DAC may be refused. The Registrar must be satisfied that the evidence is compelling enough to outweigh the need for effective enforcement of the liability. Additional factors mitigating against the issuing of a DAC on humanitarian grounds may also be considered where those factors are relevant to the decision (Bettison and Child Support Registrar (Child support second review)(2016) AATA 592).


Where a DAC is sought on humanitarian grounds, the debtor must supply evidence to support:

• the contention they are unable to give security to the satisfaction of the Registrar, and
• the humanitarian grounds relied upon in the application for the DAC.

Claims that a DAC should be issued on humanitarian grounds will be dealt with on their merits. The onus is on the debtor to satisfy the Registrar of the circumstances relevant to the application.


Where a DAC is sought on the basis that a refusal to issue the DAC would be detrimental to the interests of Australia, the debtor must supply evidence to support:

• the contention they are unable to give security to the satisfaction of the Registrar, and
• the reasons why a refusal to issue a DAC would be detrimental to the interests of Australia.

Claims that refusing to issue a certificate would be detrimental to Australia's interests will be dealt with on their merits. The onus is on the debtor to satisfy the Registrar that refusing to grant a DAC would be detrimental to the national interest.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72L(3)(b)) When Registrar must issue departure authorisation certificate


## Date of issue of a DAC


A DAC authorises the departure of a debtor on or before the 7th day after a date specified on the certificate. The date specified on the certificate must be a day after the date the certificate is issued and cannot be more than 7 days after the day the certificate is issued.


This means that a DAC can authorise the departure of a debtor no earlier than the day after the certificate is issued, and no later than 14 days after the certificate is issued.


The Registrar will usually specify the date on the DAC as the date the debtor nominates as the intended day of departure. This allows the DAC to be issued up to 7 days prior to the specified date, and authorises the debtor to depart during a period from the date specified up to 7 days after the date specified in the certificate. The Registrar will specify a date other than the intended day of departure - within the period outlined above - where it is appropriate to do so.


Example:Moshe has satisfied the Registrar that they need to depart Australia on humanitarian grounds. A DAC is going to be issued. Moshe has nominated 8 September as the date they intend to depart. The Registrar issues the DAC on 1 September specifying 8 September as the first day of authorised departure. If Moshe's travel plans change, Moshe can depart as early as 8 September or as late as 15 September without the need to apply for a new DAC.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72N What departure authorisation certificate must authorise


## Notification requirements relating to DACs


Where the Registrar issues a DAC in respect of a person, the Registrar must notify:

• the person to whom the DAC applies
• any other person to whom a copy of the DPO was provided.

Where the Registrar makes a decision to substitute a later day with respect to a DAC the Registrar must notify:

• the person to whom the DAC applies
• any other person to whom a copy of the DPO was provided.

If the Registrar refuses to issue a DAC or refuses to substitute a later day with respect to a DAC, the Registrar must notify the applicant.

# 8.3.4 Bankruptcy


## Context


Bankruptcy may be an option in the enforcement of arrears (1.1.A.100) of child support (1.1.C.60). As a creditor, the Registrar can take action to bankrupt a debtor. Arrears of child support are provable in bankruptcy.


Bankrupts are people who are unable to pay their debts and have been forced into bankruptcy (by a creditor's petition), or declared themselves bankrupt (by a debtor's petition for bankruptcy).

• Enforcement against bankrupts
• Proof of debt
• Collection during bankruptcy
• Administrative collection
• Voluntary payments
• Legal action
• Amending proof of debt
• Effect of discharge from bankruptcy
• Alternatives to bankruptcy
• Carer liabilities

## Child support liabilities for bankrupt payers


Most registrable maintenance liabilities (1.1.R.40) (7.4.1.30) receive special treatment under theBankruptcy Act 1966. This means they can still be enforced despite the payer's bankruptcy. This puts the Registrar in a different position to other creditors. In addition, a bankrupt is not released from child support, or child or spousal maintenance arrears, on discharge from bankruptcy. A liability for child support or child or spousal maintenance arrears continues despite a bankrupt's release from bankruptcy.


The Registrar may still collect child support, or child or spousal maintenance, from a bankrupt payer (1.1.P.40) by negotiating voluntary payment arrangements (7.4.2), employer withholding (1.1.E.20) (7.4.3) and by intercepting tax refunds (8.3.1).


The Registrar may also be asked to participate in other agreements and arrangements under the Bankruptcy Act that are alternatives to bankruptcy, if the bankrupt payer has other debts apart from their debt to the Registrar.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 5(1)-‘bankrupt’, section 58(5A) Nothing in this section shall be taken …, section 153 Effect of discharge


## Enforcement against bankrupts


A bankruptcy notice can be issued where the debtor has committed an 'act of bankruptcy'. The Bankruptcy Act sets out the various acts of bankruptcy which can be committed, for example, failing to satisfy a warrant of execution (see discussion on civil enforcement action (8.4.3)).


Once a debtor is declared bankrupt by the Federal Court of Australia or Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2):

• a trustee in bankruptcy will take ownership of most of the debtor's assets
• creditors are generally unable to take legal action to collect their debts, and
• all debts are notified to the trustee, and it becomes their responsibility to sell the assets and distribute any funds among the creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

There are certain rules as to which creditors are to be paid first:

• the bankrupt is not generally responsible for any debts incurred up to the date of bankruptcy. These become the responsibility of the trustee
• debts relating to child support and child and spousal maintenance are afforded some concessional treatment under the Bankruptcy Act. The Registrar may continue to recover these debts even though a payer is bankrupt
• the bankrupt is responsible for debts incurred after the date of bankruptcy
• any property acquired by the debtor after the date of the bankruptcy will generally become a part of the bankruptcy estate for distribution among the creditors, for example, lottery winnings.

Bankruptcy usually lasts for 3 years, but a debtor can apply to the court to be discharged earlier. Creditors and the trustee can also apply to the court for a bankruptcy to be extended past 3 years.


Debts arising from a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), or for child or spousal maintenance, are not released automatically by a discharge from bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Act specifies that a bankrupt is not automatically released from these debts at the time of discharge. This means that most registrable maintenance liabilities (except for those arising from a recovery order (1.1.R.30) (8.4.7)) will survive the payer's bankruptcy. However, a bankrupt may apply to the Federal Court of Australia or Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) for discharge from debts of these types.


While the payer remains bankrupt, the Registrar is able to take action to enforce any child support or spousal or child maintenance arrears that accrued before the payer's bankruptcy. This enforcement action may include:

• legal action against any property which does not vest in the trustee of the bankrupt. Any property which the payer is entitled to keep can be the subject of proceedings by the Registrar to try and satisfy a child support debt. However, the property left with a debtor after bankruptcy is usually of very little value and unlikely to produce much towards satisfying any child support debt
• the use of specific powers such as tax intercepts, salary deduction, payment arrangements and deduction of arrears from salary (8.3), and
• lodging a claim with the trustee.

After a bankrupt is released from bankruptcy, the Registrar is entitled to collect the surviving debt (that is, arrears of child support or child or spousal maintenance) using all the usual enforcement methods available under the CSRC Act.

Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014section 11 Recovery of debts


## Proof of debt


Upon being notified that a child support debtor has become bankrupt, the Registrar may lodge a proof of debt with the trustee. It is generally unnecessary to lodge a proof of debt until the trustee asks. The trustee will usually do this only where there is a likelihood of a dividend being paid to the creditors.


The Registrar can prove in the bankruptcy for all of the payer's debt outstanding at the date of bankruptcy. A debt due under the CSRC Act is a provable debt. This includes anyLPPs (1.1.L.20) which accrued up to that date and amounts recoverable from the payer through a registered recovery order.


The proof of debt should specify the amount being claimed from the trustee (the 'provable debt'). It should also give a breakdown of the amounts of the debt which are for child support and maintenance, recovery orders, and penalties.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 5(1)-‘bankrupt’, section 27 Bankruptcy courts, section 40 Acts of bankruptcy, section 58(5A) Nothing in this section shall be taken …, section 82(1) Debts provable in bankruptcy, section 122(2)(c) a conveyance, transfer, charge, payment …, section 153 Effect of discharge, Part IX—Debt agreements, Part X—Personal insolvency agreements


Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014section 11 Recovery of debts


## Collection during bankruptcy


Most liabilities registered under the CSRC Act fall within the term 'maintenance agreement or maintenance order'. Debts falling within that definition are given some special protection where a debtor becomes bankrupt. The exception is amounts recoverable by the Registrar from a former payee (1.1.P.30) under a recovery order (8.4.7). These concessional provisions do not allow the Registrar to continue to take action to recover penalties or to recover debts arising from a recovery order.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 5(1)-‘maintenance agreement’, section 5(1)- ’maintenance order’


## Administrative collection


The Registrar can continue to collect the provable debt for child support, child or spousal maintenance (not penalties or debts arising from a recovery order), including by collecting arrears through employer withholding (7.4.3) and by intercepting tax refunds (8.3.1). The Registrar can also collect any ongoing liability for child support, child maintenance or spousal maintenance through employer withholding.


A notice to a third party under CSRC Act section 72A (8.3.2) is effective against the divisible property of the bankrupt if it was served before the date of bankruptcy. If a notice is served after the date of bankruptcy, it only has effect against any non-divisible property (that is, property which does not vest in the trustee and remains in the possession and control of the bankrupt).


## Voluntary payments


The Registrar can continue to accept voluntary payments made by a bankrupt during bankruptcy. These payments do not constitute a preference.


The Registrar can also continue to credit non-agency payments (7.5.1) during the period of the bankruptcy in respect of debts which are provable in the bankrupt estate.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 122(2)(c) a conveyance, transfer, charge, payment …


## Legal action


The Registrar can take legal action to enforce a remedy against the non-divisible property in respect of a debt for child support, child or spousal maintenance.


The payee can also take legal action to enforce the debt, see8.4.6.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 58(5A) Nothing in this section shall be taken …


## Amending proof of debt


An amended proof of debt can be lodged at any stage during the administration of the bankrupt estate. If the Registrar has lodged a proof of debt with the trustee and subsequently collects any part of the provable debt during bankruptcy, an amended proof of debt will be lodged.


## Effect of discharge from bankruptcy


After a discharge from bankruptcy, the Registrar is still able to recover the child support or maintenance debt relating to the period before the bankruptcy.


The bankrupt may apply to court for a specific order discharging them from all or part of the surviving debt (that is, that part of the provable debt which relates to child support, or child or spousal maintenance). The Registrar will not discharge the child support or maintenance portion of a registered child support debt unless the court has made an order under Bankruptcy Act section 153(2A).


The Registrar cannot recover any pre-bankruptcy debt relating to a recovery order, or any penalties relating to that period, as these debts are not specially protected under the Bankruptcy Act. They are automatically discharged upon the bankrupt's discharge from bankruptcy. After the bankrupt is discharged, the Registrar will vary the Child Support Register to remove any amounts relating to penalties or registered recovery orders that were included in the provable debt, as these are not recoverable at law.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966section 153 Effect of discharge


## Alternatives to bankruptcy


Creditors can be asked to participate in debt agreements and arrangements under Parts IX and X of the Bankruptcy Act as alternatives to bankruptcy. These arrangements or agreements limit the collection of provable debts.


The Registrar will not take part in making an agreement under Part IX and is not bound by any Part IX agreement made which affects the collection of amounts payable for child support, child or spousal maintenance, that are registered under the CSRC Act.


An arrangement under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act is a formal process in which creditors vote on the proposed arrangement. The Registrar is not bound by any Part X arrangement made which affects the collection of liabilities registered under the CSRC Act.


Act reference:Bankruptcy Act 1966Part IX —Debt agreements, Part X—Personal insolvency agreements


## Carer liabilities (1.1.C.30)


Carer debts (8.1.1) are treated differently to child support liabilities in relation to bankruptcy.


Carer liabilities that arise and are due before the date of bankruptcy are provable during the bankruptcy of the payer of the carer liability (the payee of the registered maintenance liability), but do not receive special treatment under the Bankruptcy Act. This is because carer liabilities do not arise under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. Ordinarily, the Registrar may lodge a proof of debt in these circumstances unless it is considered that it is not economical to pursue the debt, or the Registrar is satisfied that the debt is not legally recoverable. The Registrar cannot take administrative enforcement action under the CSRC Act against these provable debts during the bankruptcy of the payer of the carer liability. In addition, a bankrupt is released from these provable debts on discharge from bankruptcy.


Carer liabilities that arise and are due on or after the date of bankruptcy are generally not provable during the bankruptcy of the payer of the carer liability, regardless of whether the period to which the debt relates is before, or on or after, the date of bankruptcy. However, the Registrar can take administrative enforcement action under the CSRC Act against these debts during the bankruptcy of the payer of the carer liability. A bankrupt is not released from these debts on discharge from bankruptcy

# 8.4.2 Choice of court


## Context


The Registrar may take action to recover a debt in a court.


## Choice of court for recovery action


The Registrar must choose the court in which to take recovery action. The Registrar may take action to recover a debt in:

• a court with jurisdiction for the recovery of debts up to the amount of that debt, for example, local and state courts
• the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Divisions 1 and 2)
• the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory
• the Family Court of a state, and
• a court of summary jurisdiction. A court of summary jurisdiction is defined in section 2B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Essentially, any justice of the peace, or magistrate of a state or territory, sitting as a court to hear matters summarily, is a court of summary jurisdiction.

The Registrar cannot take legal action in more than one court, at the same time, for the same debt.


Example:The Registrar cannot use the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia if there is already legal action for recovery taking place in a local court for the same debt, unless the action in the local court is formally discontinued.


However, the Registrar may take successive actions using different enforcement processes, that is, civil action and action under the FL Act (Deputy Child Support Registrar and Harrison(1995) FamCA 137).


Where judgment is obtained in a civil court, the Registrar is not prevented from seeking to recover any unpaid portion of the judgement under the FL Act in a court with family law jurisdiction. However, only the parts of the judgment representing maintenance (as distinct from penalties or costs) may be enforced in this way (DCSR and Harrison).

# 8.4.3 Enforcement by civil action


## Context


If the Registrar has been unsuccessful in recovering a child support debt (1.1.C.90) by administrative means, there are other enforcement methods available. The Registrar may apply to enforce the debt under the FL Act (8.4.4) or may take civil action to recover the debt. Civil action involves obtaining judgment, and then enforcing the judgment through the court. The Registrar can also recover carer debts (1.1.C.30) and amounts owed by employers by taking civil action.


## On this page


Civil recovery action is taken by lodging a statement of claim at the court and serving the debtor with a summons. If the matter is not settled or the debtor fails to respond, the Registrar may apply for judgment to be automatically entered against the debtor.

• Preparation of a summons and statement of claim
• Obtaining judgment
• Garnishee orders
• Warrant of execution
• Summons for oral examination

## Preparation of a summons & statement of claim


A summons for recovery of a debt, where the amount of the debt is not in dispute, is known as a liquidated claim (also known as a special claim). The statement of claim must set out the basis for the claim so that the debtor can easily lodge a defence with the court disputing the claim. The summons served must state a time limit from the date of service during which the debtor may dispute the claim. The debtor is advised that a default judgment may be obtained against them after that time.


The summons and statement of claim must be filed with the court, and stamped with the court seal. A sealed copy must be personally served on the debtor. An affidavit of service must be available to prove service and receipt before any further step in the action may be taken. The Rules of Court in the jurisdiction in which the action is being taken will set out the form of summons and requirements for service and affidavits.


## Obtaining judgment


A summons will allow a certain time after service, during which a debtor can dispute the claim by filing a defence, called a response, with the court. The response must set out the basis for the dispute and the aspects of the claim the debtor disagrees with. The response must be filed with the court, and a sealed copy served on the Registrar. The application filed by the Registrar will provide the relevant address for service (generally the solicitor on the record or the Services Australia postal address).


If no response is filed, the Registrar can apply for a default judgment. The judgment will be for the amount of the debt claimed, plus costs and interest. Costs are prescribed in the court rules, and generally relate to the amount of the debt. Interest is also calculated at a rate prescribed in the court rules. Judgment will be based on proof of service on the debtor on a particular day, and the lack of a response from the debtor. The court may reverse judgment at any time upon proof by the debtor that they did not receive personal notice of the claim.


If a response is filed, the matter will proceed through any prelisting steps required by the court rules, and ultimately to a hearing. If an amount of money is found owing, judgment will be entered.


## Garnishee orders


Garnishee (1.1.G.10) orders are available under court rules. These orders can attach an ongoing source of earnings paid to the debtor or appropriate a single payment due to the debtor. However, these orders have much the same effect as administrative powers already possessed by the Registrar (see collection from salary or wages (7.4.3) and collection from third parties (8.3.2)).


## Warrant of execution


A warrant of execution is a request addressed to the bailiff or sheriff of the court, asking them to visit the debtor's residence, or other place at which they may have assets. The bailiff or sheriff will seize any goods or possessions which they believe may be saleable in an attempt to satisfy the judgment debt. Often items such as cars, electrical equipment, whitegoods, or furniture will be seized. Generally, clothes and equipment necessary to enable the debtor to pursue their employment are not able to be sold. Bailiffs hold auctions to sell the goods seized from debtors.


In more senior courts, where the debt is large, the sheriff may also have power to sell real estate, or land and fixtures.


## Summons for oral examination


An application can also be made for a debtor to be summonsed to appear before a magistrate or a judge and to provide information about their assets and liabilities on oath. This can be useful where a debtor has complex business or overseas financial arrangements. Information obtained from an examination may be followed with other enforcement proceedings.

# 8.4.6 Payee's right to enforce debt via court proceedings


## Context


In most cases the Registrar is solely entitled to and responsible for collecting a registered maintenance liability or a carer liability (1.1.C.30). The payer (1.1.P.40) may voluntarily make payments directly to the payee (1.1.P.30) or a third party in the form of non-agency payments (7.5.1), however, the payee of a registered maintenance liability or a carer liability may not enforce payments under that liability except by instituting court proceedings under CSRC Act section 113A.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 30(3) Effect of registration, section 69B Overpayments of payees, section 113A Recovery of debts by payees


## On this page

• Prior notice to the Registrar
• In which court may the payee institute proceedings?
• Parties to the proceedings
• Payments pursuant to orders
• Court's power to obtain information
• Payee must notify the Registrar of any orders

## Prior notice to the Registrar


A payee of a registered maintenance liability or a carer liability must give prior notice to the Registrar of his or her intention to institute court proceedings. The notice must be in writing (including by email or facsimile) and given to the Registrar at least 14 days before the payee files his or her application in the court, unless the court allows for a shorter period because of exceptional circumstances.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 113A(1) Recovery of debts by payees


## In which court may the payee institute proceedings?


The payee can choose to enforce a child support debt (1.1.C.90) under the FL Act, or take civil action to recover the debt. The payee of a carer debt can only use civil action to recover a carer debt.


Civil action involves obtaining judgment, and then enforcing the judgment through the court.


Proceedings under the FL Act may be brought in any court with family law jurisdiction including the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, and state, local and magistrates courts. The FL Act, Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) (Family Law) Rules 2021, which adopt the Family Law Rules, apply to child support (1.1.C.60) enforcement proceedings under the CSRC Act as if the proceedings had been brought under the FL Act.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 105 Application of Family Law Act, section 113 Recovery of debts etc, section 113A Recovery of debts by payees


## Parties to the proceedings


The payee and payer are the parties to proceedings brought by the payee of the registered maintenance liability or carer liability under CSRC Act section 113A. Services Australia will not normally be involved, however, the Registrar has a discretion to intervene in payee enforcement proceedings.


The Commonwealth is not liable for costs in enforcement proceedings brought by the payee of a registered maintenance liability or a carer liability, unless the Registrar is involved as a party. If the Registrar is involved, the court would decide, upon application from the parties, whether to order costs against the Registrar or any other party.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 111E Registrar may intervene in proceedings, section 111G Costs in proceedings instituted by payee to recover debt, section 113A Recovery of debts by payees


## Payments pursuant to orders


Where the court orders the payer to make a payment, that payment must be made to the Registrar. The Registrar must pay the amount received from the payer in accordance with the order to the payee of the registered maintenance liability or carer liability as soon as practicable.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 111F Court order for payment in proceedings instituted by payee to recover debt


## Court's power to obtain information


In payee enforcement proceedings, the court may exercise the Registrar's powers to obtain information and evidence for the purposes of the CSRC Act (11.2.4).


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 120 Obtaining of information and evidence


## Payee must notify the Registrar of any orders


The payee of a registered maintenance liability or a carer liability is obliged to provide the Registrar with notice within 14 days of the court making any order in relation to the payee and the debt (including orders about costs, which are not collectable by the Registrar).


Notice may be provided to the Registrar in writing (including via email or facsimile), personally or via telephone.


It is an offence if the payee fails to notify the Registrar that a court order has been made in relation to the payee and the debt due in relation to the liability.

# 8.4.8 Private recovery of child support


## Context


A person may take court action to collect amounts payable under a child support assessment (1.1.C.70), registered maintenance liability (7.4.1.30) or carer liability (1.1.C.30) (8.1.1). In some cases, a recovery order (1.1.R.30) may be sought (8.4.7).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 79 Recovery of amounts of child support, section 143 Amounts paid where no liability to pay exists etc.


CSRC Actsection 69B Overpayments of payees, section 113A Recovery of debts by payees


## Right of payee (1.1.P.30) to seek recovery


A payee can privately recover amounts due and payable by a liable parent (1.1.L.30) through court action. These amounts may be due and payable to the payee (private collect (1.1.P.110)), or due and payable to the Commonwealth because the liability is registered for collection by the Registrar (agency collect (1.1.A.50)).


The payee can recover unpaid child support (1.1.C.60) in:

• a court having jurisdiction for the recovery of debtsup to the amount of the child supportup to the amount of the debt, or
• up to the amount of the child support
• up to the amount of the debt, or
• a court having jurisdiction under the CSA Act (in relation to amounts under a child support liability that is not registered under the CSRC Act or in relation to a recovery order), or
• a court having jurisdiction under the CSRC Act (in relation to amounts payable under a registered maintenance liability or carer liability).

See8.4for details of courts with jurisdiction and8.4.6for details of a payee's right to enforce debt via court proceedings if the child support owed is registered for collection with the Registrar.


If child support is registered for collection (agency collect), the payee of the registered maintenance liability or carer liability must first give notice (at least 14 days prior unless there are exceptional circumstances) to the commencement of the intended court action.

# 8.4.4 Enforcement under the FL Act


## Context


In addition to the enforcement powers contained in the CSRC Act for civil recovery through state courts (8.4.3), the Registrar is able to take action to enforce outstanding child support (1.1.C.60) liabilities under the FL Act.


## On this page

• Registrar initiated proceedings
• Notice requiring financial information
• Order for payment of the amount owed
• Enforcement hearing (or summons)
• Enforcement orders available
• Garnishee orders
• Sequestration orders or appointment of a receiver
• Orders for seizure & sale of real & personal property
• The 12-month rule
• Contempt of court

## Registrar initiated proceedings


The Registrar can bring proceedings in any court with family law jurisdiction including the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, and state, local and magistrates courts (8.4.2). The FL Act, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) (Family Law) Rules 2021 apply to child support enforcement proceedings under the CSRC Act as if the proceedings had been brought under the FL Act.


The Registrar is able to bring proceedings for recovery of a debt in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) under rule 11.01 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021. Proceedings in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) are brought under the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) (Family Law) Rules 2021, which adopt the same rules as those used in Division 1 (rule 2.01).

## Notice requiring financial information


The Registrar does not usually request the court to issue a notice requiring financial information because the Registrar has statutory information gathering powers under the CSRC Act (11.2.4), including a penalty for failure to respond.


A notice requiring financial information can be used to aid the enforcement of a maintenance liability (rule 11.10 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021). The notice can be used where the payment of money is required and can be issued by the Registrar of the court on the request of a person entitled to bring proceedings. A debtor who receives a notice is required to complete the required Financial Statement and return it within the required time. There is no sanction for failure to respond to the written request for information.

Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) (Family Law) Rules 2021rule 2.01 Application of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021


## Order for payment of the amount owed


If the debtor's obligation to pay does not arise from a court order (for example, if the arrears (1.1.A.100) relate to an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support), the Registrar must first obtain an order for payment of the amount before an enforcement order can be made (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021, rule 11.03).


## Enforcement hearing (or summons)


An enforcement summons or enforcement hearing is available in relation to:

• all liabilities that are registrable maintenance liabilities (1.1.R.40) registered under the CSRC Act and payable to the Commonwealth under section 30, and
• any penalty for late payment of child support under CSRC Act section 67. (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021 rule 11.01(1)(a) and 11.01(2)(c)).

They are not available for penalties for underestimating income, which are imposed under the CSA Act.


The debtor can be required to attend an enforcement hearing and produce documents (Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021, rule 11.07).


On hearing the matter, the court can make any of a range of enforcement orders, including seizure and sale of goods or property, garnishee (1.1.G.10) orders, or orders preventing the dissipation of property or assets.


An application for an enforcement summons or an enforcement hearing is not a prerequisite for proceedings for sale of property or garnishment, but the examination allows the Registrar to examine the debtor and to select the most appropriate method of enforcement.


A Registrar of the court, or a judge, may refuse to issue a summons or require the debtor to attend an enforcement hearing where:

• the amount is too trivial
• the examination is unnecessary as the information is already known
• there is insufficient court time and a more convenient court is available
• another court is geographically more suitable, or
• proceedings for variation are pending.

Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 2) (Family Law) Rules 2021rule 2.01 Application of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021


## Enforcement orders available


The court can make various types of orders for enforcement of the debtor's obligation (rule 11.05 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021).


These include orders:

• for garnishment of the debtor's assets or income
• sequestrating the debtor's estate or appointing a receiver
• for seizure and sale of the debtor's personal property
• for the sale of real property.

## Garnishee orders


The court has the power to make orders for the garnishment (or attachment) of the debtor's earnings or of money in bank accounts, etc., payable to the debtor. It is not usually necessary for the Registrar to seek these orders to enforce amounts outstanding for child support as the Registrar has similar powers to deduct child support from salary and wages (7.4.3) or can issue a notice against a third party (8.3.2) without having to resort to court action.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debt from third persons


## Sequestration orders or appointment of a receiver


The court can order sequestration of a debtor's property, or the appointment of a receiver (Division 11.1.5 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021). These types of orders are useful if by obtaining possession of the property the sequestrator/receiver could obtain income due to the debtor. In most cases the powers provided to the Registrar to collect debts from third parties (8.3.2) are sufficient in these circumstances. However, an order for sequestration or appointment of a receiver may be useful in cases where it is believed the respondent may dispose of assets prior to the execution of any enforcement order.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 72A Registrar may collect debts from third person


Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021Chapter 11—Enforcement of court orders and judgments


## Orders for seizure & sale of real & personal property


The court can order the seizure and sale of the debtor's personal property (Division 11.1.3 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Family Law) Rules 2021). The court can order the appointment of an enforcement officer to seize and sell personal property to enforce an order of the court, for example, sale of a motor vehicle. The Registrar will not request such an order in circumstances where the vehicle was of a modest value and was the means of the debtor travelling to his or her place of employment.


The court can order the sale of real property (real estate) to enforce an order for the payment of money.


## The 12-month rule


The 12-month rule is a common law rule which states that maintenance liabilities older than 12 months may not be recoverable in the courts, especially where there has been no application to enforce the liability and no special circumstances apply. The rule is discretionary but has been argued to apply to child support debts.


However, the Full Court of the Family Court inHides and Hatton(1997) FamCA 28stated that the 12-month rule does not apply to:

• the making of departure orders under the CSA Act
• the payment of maintenance arrears owed for a period greater than 12 months, or
• orders made which have retrospective effect beyond 12 months

as this law only applied prior to the child support legislation.


A court must not require that there be special circumstances that justify enforcing a maintenance order merely because the maintenance payable under it is more than 12 months in arrears.


Act reference:FL Actsection 106 Maintenance orders—more than 12 months in arrears


## Contempt of court


FL Act Part VII Division 13A provides sanctions for contravention of orders made under that Act. In particular, a court can imprison a person who contravenes a parenting order for child maintenance by not paying child maintenance.


If a court ordered liability is not registered with the Registrar for collection and remains enforceable by the payee (1.1.P.30), contravention of the order may lead to the imposition of sanctions under the FL Act, including imprisonment.


However, the law allowing for imprisonment for contravention of a court order does not apply to a person simply because they have not paid child maintenance to the Registrar in accordance with registered liabilities. Where a court ordered liability is registered with the Registrar, a failure to pay the registered liability does not amount to a contravention of the order. Therefore, a person cannot be imprisoned because of failure to pay amounts which arise under a child support liability which is registered for collection.


A liability that is registered with the Registrar for collection will cease to be enforceable by the Registrar if the payee makes an election to have the liability and/or arrears no longer enforced. If the payer fails to pay either the current liability or the arrears to the payee directly, that failure may amount to contravention of the court order. This may make the payer (1.1.P.40) liable to imprisonment or other sanction, if the contravention was wilful.


If, after court enforcement action by the Registrar, a liable parent (1.1.P.10) breaches the court order for payment, an action for contempt may be an option open to the Registrar.

# 8.4.7 Recovery orders


## Context


A recovery order (1.1.R.30) is an order made by the court requiring a person to repay a specific amount of child support (1.1.C.60).


## On this page

• Orders for repayment of overpaid amounts
• Parentage overpayment orders

## Orders for repayment of overpaid amounts


CSA Act section 143 gives the court discretion to make an order for recovery of an overpayment. The court may make such orders as it considers just and equitable to give effect to, or to adjust, the rights of the payer (1.1.P.40) and payee (1.1.P.30) concerned.


A person can apply for an order under CSA Act section 143(1)(a) to recover an overpayment (1.1.O.20) of child support arising under the CSA Act. Amounts that were overpaid due to a payer ceasing to be a resident of Australia (1.1.R.100) or a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10) are excluded from the amount which can be recovered under section 143(1)(a).


A person can apply for an order under CSA Act section 143(1)(b) to recover overpayments of child support for registered maintenance liabilities (including other types of liabilities that originated outside the CSA Act, but collected under the CSRC Act) where a decision is made that the registered maintenance liability should have never existed.


A registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) may be created if either the overpayment is a parentage overpayment or the overpayment is a result of a decision that the registered maintenance liability should never have existed, and the court orders the former payee to repay an amount to the former payer (CSRC Act section 17A(1)(c)). The person in whose favour the order is made (the former payer, who is the payee of the recovery order) can register the order with the Registrar for collection. However, costs orders in respect of section 143 proceedings are not able to be registered with the Registrar for collection (CSRC Act section 17A(2)).


Act reference:CSA Actsection 106A Declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, section 107 Declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, section 143 Amounts paid where no liability to pay exists etc.


CSRC Actsection 17A Liabilities in relation to persons who have paid amounts where no liability to pay because the person is not the parent


Family Assistance and Child Support Legislation Amendment (Protecting Children) Act 2018Schedule 1 item 173


## Parentage overpayment orders


A payer can apply to a court under CSA Act section 107 for a declaration that he or she is not a parent (1.1.P.10) of a child for whom he or she is liable to pay child support (10.4.2). An application for a declaration under CSA Act section 107 cannot be made if a court has already declared under CSA Act section 106A that the person concerned should be assessed in respect of theCOTC(1.1.C.210). Instead, the applicant may appeal the section 106A declaration.


If the court is satisfied that the payer is not the child's parent, it may grant the declaration (CSA Act section 107(4)). Once a declaration is made, the Registrar is taken never to have accepted the payee's application for child support for the child.


CSA Act section 107(6) says that the court must consider making an order under CSA Act section 143 for recovery of any overpaid child support as soon as practicable after making a declaration under CSA Act section 107.


If the court makes a section 143 order requiring the former payee to repay an amount (that is, a specified sum of money) to the former payer, either following a section 107 declaration or the overturning on appeal of a declaration made under CSA Act section 106A, this is a parentage overpayment order. The Registrar can register the order and recover from the former payee (who is now the payer under the order) the amount the court has ordered him or her to repay to the former payer (who is now the payee under the order).


If a court makes an order under CSA Act section 143 requiring the former payee to transfer property to the former payer (rather than a specified sum of money) this is not a registrable maintenance liability. The Registrar cannot register such an order for collection and the former payer (now the payee of the order) will need to take his or her own enforcement action.


Act reference:CSA Actsection 106A Declaration that a person should be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, section 107 Declaration that a person should not be assessed in respect of the costs of the child, section 143 Amounts paid where no liability to pay exists etc.

The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 8.4.5 Applying to court to set aside or restrain a transaction


## Context


A court has the power to prevent a payer (1.1.P.40) of an enforceable maintenance liability (1.1.E.30) or carer liability (1.1.C.30) from disposing of property, or to set aside a transaction in which a payer disposed of property.


## Order to set aside a transaction


The CSRC Act gives the Registrar the power to apply to the court for an order to set aside or restrain a transaction if the court is satisfied that the transaction has been made to defeat or reduce the payer's ability:

• to pay child support (1.1.C.60)
• to pay a debt owed to the Registrar under an enforceable maintenance liability, or meet that liability, or
• to pay a debt owed to the Registrar under a carer liability, or meet that liability.

The court can also make an order without an application from the Registrar.


Example:A payer with a significant debt sold his house to his brother for $200,000. It appears that this was not an 'arm's length transaction' (a genuine sale between unrelated persons at a fair market price) as the market price would have been about $400,000. It may be that there was an intention to avoid the payment of child support by selling the property. If an enforcement summons is currently being heard, the Registrar should inform the court or else apply to the court to have the transaction set aside.


The wording of CSRC Act section 72C is similar to the wording of FL Act section 106B.


If the court is satisfied that the transaction has been made, or is proposed to be made, to reduce or defeat the payer's child support liability then the court can set aside the transaction. This will make the transaction void.


The court can order that any money dealt with in the arrangement can be taken to pay child support or costs. When doing so, the court must consider any other people genuinely affected by the proceedings and can make orders to protect those people. Where a property that has been sold, is sold again to a bona fide third party for value, in order to protect innocent third parties who would otherwise be unfairly penalised, the court will generally not set aside the transaction.


The court can order the payer, or any person colluding with the payer in making the transaction, to pay the costs of:

• the payee (1.1.P.30)
• any third party genuinely affected, or
• the Registrar

which they incurred by making the transaction or the proposed making of the transaction.

# 8.4.1 The Registrar's power to recover debt through litigation


## Context


Once a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) (7.4.1.30) is registered for agency collect (1.1.A.50), the amounts payable are debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer (1.1.P.40). Carer debts (1.1.C.30) are also debts that are due to the Commonwealth (8.1.1).


These debts are enforceable by the Registrar and may be recovered through court proceedings brought by either the Registrar or the payee (1.1.P.30). This page discusses the Registrar's power to bring proceedings. The payee's right to bring proceedings to recover debts is discussed in8.4.6and8.4.8.


## Registrar's power to take recovery action


The Registrar can commence court action in any court having jurisdiction under the Act.


Act reference:CSRC Actsection 113 Recovery of debts etc.


## Representation of the Registrar in proceedings


In any enforcement action or prosecution under the CSRC Act or any action which arises out of the Act, the Registrar may be represented by:

• a person enrolled as a barrister, solicitor or legal practitioner of a federal court or the Supreme Court of a state or territory, or
• a person the Registrar or his delegate has authorised in writing to appear.

When a person appears in court proceedings and states that they appear by authority of the Registrar or his delegate, it is prima facie evidence that the person is authorised. The court will accept that the person is authorised unless there is evidence that the person is not authorised. See11.1for more information about authorisations.

# 9.1.1 Court order - child maintenance order


## Context


The FL Act does not allow a court to make a child maintenance order if the Registrar could make an administrative assessment (1.1.A.30) of child support (1.1.C.60) for the child (FL Act section 66E). This means that most of the child support matters are dealt with under the CSA Act.


The court, however, is able to manage applications for maintenance for children and from parents or carers who are not eligible for a child support assessment. The FL Act makes provision for an Australian court to make a child maintenance order. These orders can be made by consent of the parties or by a judgement of the court. The court can also register agreements about child maintenance.


A child maintenance order can be registered by the Registrar if it is a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40).


See10.4.5Effect of a court order for maintenance of an eligible child where there is no assessment.

## Who can apply to a court for a child maintenance order?


The following people can apply for a child maintenance order for a child (FL Act section 66F(1)):

• a parent of the child (including an adoptive parent)
• the child in their own right
• a grandparent of the child, and
• any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.

The following people can apply for a child maintenance order for a child who is in the care or guardianship of a person under a child welfare law (FL Act section 66F(2)):

• the child in their own right
• a parent of the child who has daily care of the child (including an adoptive parent)
• a relative of the child who has daily care of the child, and
• a child welfare officer of the relevant state or territory.

## Who can a court order to pay child maintenance?

• Either or both of the child's parents (FL Act section 66C)
• The child's step-parent (FL Act sections 66D, 66M) (9.1.2)

## Can a court make an order for a child over 18 years?


A court can make a child maintenance order for a child over 18 years, or extend an order past a child's 18th birthday, if satisfied that it is necessary:

• to enable the child to complete their education, or
• because the child has a physical or mental disability (FL Act section 66L).

## How can an order be changed?


Any person entitled to apply to a court for a child maintenance order can apply to the court for a variation to an existing order (FL Act section 66S).


## When does an order end?


A child maintenance order may contain a provision that says it will end at a specified time, or when a particular event occurs. A child maintenance order ceases to be in force if the Registrar makes an administrative assessment of child support for the payer, payee and child concerned (CSA Act section 152).


Under the FL Act, a child maintenance order will end:

• where the child maintenance order is for a child under 18, when the child turns 18 unless the order says that it will continue after that (FL Act sections 66L and 66T)
• if the child dies (FL Act section 66U)
• if the payer dies, unless the order expressly provides for it to continue after the death of the payer (FL Act section 66U)
• if the payee dies, unless the order expressly provides for it to continue after the death of the payee and nominates a person to whom those payments are to be made (FL Act section 66U)
• if the child is adopted, marries or starts a de facto relationship (FL Act section 66V)
• where the child maintenance order is for a child aged over 18, which was made to enable the child to complete his or her education, when the child ceases education (FL Act section 66VA), or
• where the child maintenance order is for a child aged over 18, which was made because the child has a physical or mental disability, if the child ceases to have the disability (FL Act section 66VA).

## How can I recognise a child maintenance order?


A child maintenance order typically has a clause similar to the example below.


Example:The father is to pay the mother for the maintenance of each of the 3 children of the marriage the sum of $45 per week being a total of $135 per week.

## Step-children, child maintenance orders & child support assessments


The Registrar can treat a step-child as a relevant dependent child of a parent in a child support assessment if:

• a court has made an order requiring the parent to provide financial support for the step-child (10.4.4), and
• the parent has at least shared care of their step-child.

See10.4.4'Orders in relation to step-children' for more information.


If a child support parent is providing financial support for a step-child and neither of the child's biological parents is able to provide financial support for the child due to death, ill health or caring responsibilities, the parent may have grounds for a change of assessment (CSA Act section 117(10)). This means parents may be able to have step-children considered administratively, when calculating child support, without the requirement to obtain court orders. See5.2.11for more information.

# 9.1.3 Court order - spousal & de facto maintenance


## Context


The FL Act and theFamily Court Act 1997(WA) provides for a court to make orders for a person to pay financial support for their spouse or former spouse. This is called spousal maintenance. The court may also order a person to pay maintenance to a de facto partner, or former de facto partner.

## On this page

• Spousal maintenance
• De facto maintenance

## Spousal maintenance


Section 18(1) of the CSRC Act provides that a spousal maintenance order made by a court is a registrable maintenance liability.


### Who can apply for spousal maintenance?


A party to a marriage can apply for spousal maintenance, even if the marriage has been dissolved or is void (FL Act sections 71 and 72).


### How can a spousal maintenance order be changed?


A court can vary a spousal maintenance order in further proceedings between the parties about spousal maintenance (FL Act section 83).


### When does a spousal maintenance order end?


FL Act section 82 provides that a spousal maintenance order ends:

• when the payee dies
• if the payee remarries (unless the court orders that payments should continue because of special circumstances), or
• when the payer dies (unless the court made an order for lifetime maintenance before 1983).

### How can I recognise a spousal maintenance order?


A spousal maintenance order typically has a clause similar to the example below.


Example:The husband is to pay the wife maintenance for herself in the sum of $75 per week.


## De facto maintenance


An order made by a court for a party to a de facto relationship to pay a periodic amount for the maintenance of the other party to the de facto relationship is a registrable maintenance liability (CSRC Act section 18(2)).


### Orders made under the Family Court Act 1997 (WA)


The Registrar can register a de facto maintenance liability made under the Family Court Act 1997 (WA). See1.3.2.30for details of the date from which various provisions had effect.


### Who can apply for de facto maintenance under the FL Act?


A party to a de facto relationship that has broken down can apply for maintenance (FL Act section 90SE). A court can only make an order if satisfied that at least one of the following conditions exists (FL Act section 90SB):

• the relationship was of at least 2 years duration
• there is a child of the relationship
• the applicant made substantial contributions to the relationship and a failure to make the order would result in serious injustice to the applicant, or
• the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory.

### Party to a de facto relationship


A person is in a de facto relationship with another person if (FL Act section 4AA):

• the persons are not legally married to each other
• the persons are not related by family, and
• having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.

This definition of de facto relationship includes relationships between 2 persons of different sexes and relationships between 2 persons of the same sex (FL Act section 4AA(5)).


### From whom can de facto maintenance be claimed?


De facto maintenance can be claimed from the other party to the de facto relationship (FL Act section 90SF). Under FL Act section 90SS a court can make various orders regarding maintenance including orders for lump sum payments, transfer of property and periodic payments. It is only orders for periodic payments that can be registered for enforcement by the Registrar.


### How can a de facto maintenance order be changed?


A court can vary a de facto maintenance order in further proceedings between the parties about de facto maintenance (FL Act section 90SI).


### When does a de facto maintenance order end?


FL Act section 90SJ provides that a de facto maintenance order ends:

• when either party to the de facto relationship dies, or
• if the payee marries (unless a court orders that payments should continue because of special circumstances).

### How can I recognise a de facto maintenance order?


A de facto maintenance order typically has a clause similar to the example below.


Example:Party A is to pay de facto maintenance to Party B in the sum of $100 per week.

# 9.1.4 Court registered agreements, financial agreements & parenting plans


## Context

The CSRC Act provides that court registered agreements for spousal maintenance (section 18) and child maintenance (section 17(1)) are registrable maintenance liabilities.

• When does a court registered agreement end?

## Child maintenance agreements


Before 27 December 2000, parents who were not eligible for an assessment of child support could make an agreement for child maintenance and register this in a court. Court registered maintenance agreements have effect as if they were court orders made by consent (FL Act section 86 and section 87).


## Parenting plans


Parenting plans were introduced on 27 December 2000. A parenting plan is a written agreement between a child's parents about any aspect of their parental responsibilities. A parenting plan can contain provisions about child maintenance (FL Act section 63C) and can be registered by a court (FL Act section 63E).


Child maintenance provisions in a court registered parenting plan have no effect if the Registrar could make a child support assessment for the payer, payee and child involved. However, the parents can apply to the Registrar for acceptance of the written agreement as a child support agreement (FL Act section 63CAA) (Part 6).


If the Registrar cannot make a child support assessment for a case, the child maintenance provisions in a court registered parenting plan have effect as if they were a child maintenance order made by the court (FL Act section 63G).


## Spousal maintenance


Before 27 December 2000, parties to a marriage could make an agreement for spousal maintenance and register this in a court. Court registered maintenance agreements have effect as if they were court orders made by consent (FL Act section 86 and section 87).


From 27 December 2000, a spousal maintenance agreement must comply with the requirements of a Financial Agreement (FL Act Part VIIIA). A court must approve the provisions of the agreement.


## De facto financial agreements


De facto financial agreements (FL Act Part VIIIAB) are not court registered maintenance agreements and are not registrable maintenance liabilities (CSRC Act section 17(1) and section 18). If a de facto financial agreement contains provisions relating to child maintenance, the parties to the agreement can apply to the Registrar to have the agreement accepted as a child support agreement (Part 6).


## How can an agreement be changed?


A child maintenance agreement can be varied by:

• the parents making a parenting plan that includes child maintenance provisions, and applying to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) for it to be registered, or
• one of the parents applying to the court for a variation (FL Act section 66S).

A parenting plan may be changed:

• by revoking the existing parenting plan and making a further agreement which comes into effect when it is registered as a parenting plan (FL Act section 63D), or
• by applying to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Division 1) for variation to provisions of the parenting plan that have effect as if they were a child maintenance order (FL Act section 63H and section 66S).

A spousal maintenance agreement may be changed by:

• making a new agreement which must be approved by the court, or
• one of the parties to the agreement applying to the court under FL Act section 83 .

## When does a court registered agreement end?


A spousal maintenance agreement ends at the same time as a spousal maintenance order (9.1.3).


A child maintenance agreement ends at the same time as a child maintenance order (9.1.1).


The child maintenance provisions in a parenting plan will end at the same time as a child maintenance order (9.1.1).

# 9.2.1 Requirement to advise the Registrar of new order or affecting event


## Context


A payee of a registered maintenance liability must notify the Registrar of new orders, court registered agreements or events which vary or affect the liability. The payer can apply to have the particulars of the Register changed if a new order or court registered agreement has been made, or if an event has occurred that affects the liability.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 4, section 33, section 34, section 35, section 36, section 37


## Court orders, registered maintenance agreements & affecting events


After an Australian court makes an order or registers a maintenance agreement that varies or affects a registered maintenance liability (including a recovery order) (8.4.7), the payee of that registered maintenance liability must notify the Registrar (CSRC Act section 33).


The payee must also advise the Registrar if an affecting event happens under the terms and conditions of an Australian court order or maintenance agreement in relation to a registered maintenance liability. This requirement does not relate to child support assessments or to registered overseas maintenance liabilities (CSRC Act section 34).


An affecting event is any event that varies the liability, otherwise affects the liability or is a terminating event for the liability (CSRC Act section 4). The kinds of events that would be an affecting event would depend upon the terms of the court order or court registered agreement. For details of terminating events for:

• child maintenance orders, see9.1.1
• spousal maintenance orders, see9.1.3, and
• court registered agreements, see9.1.4.

The payer can apply to have the Register varied to give effect to an Australian court order or court registered maintenance agreement that varies or affects a registered maintenance liability other than a child support assessment, or to recognise the happening of an affecting event that affects a registered maintenance liability other than a child support assessment (CSRC Act section 35).


The Registrar must vary the Register on receipt of the notification by the payee or an application by the payer (CSRC Act section 36).


The Registrar can also vary a registered maintenance liability if the Registrar is of the opinion that an order has been made, a court has registered an agreement, or that an affecting event has happened, to allow the Registrar to act upon advice received from a court, the payer, payee or another person, where appropriate (CSRC Act section 37).

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 9.2.3 Joint election to suspend collection after a change in care


## Context


An Australian court order or court registered agreement for child maintenance (CSRC Act section 17(1)), that gives rise to an enforceable maintenance liability, does not stop being in force when the child leaves the payee's care, unless this is specifically stated in the order or agreement. The payer and payee, however, can make a joint election for the Registrar to suspend collection of the amounts payable for the child. Such an election can only be made in respect of liabilities that are registrable maintenance liabilities under section 17(1). An election under section 39B to suspend collection after a change in care cannot be made in relation to liabilities that arise under a child support assessment (section 17(2)) or assessments varied by a court order. See2.5.5for information about court variation to assessments.


A court order or a court registered agreement for child maintenance does not end when the payee ceases to provide ongoing daily care for the child, unless this is specifically stated in the court order or agreement. Therefore, a liability of this type does not usually end when the Registrar is advised that the child for whom child support is payable has left the payee's care.


A payer can apply to a court for a variation to the order in these circumstances. If a court varied the order, the Registrar would amend the Register accordingly.


However, there is also a simple administrative way for parents to deal with this situation. A payer and payee can make a joint election for the Registrar to suspend collection of the liability during a period when the child is not in the payee's care (section 39B).

• For what period is the liability suspended?
• Can the liability be suspended for only one child?
• What if the child returns to the care of the payee?
• Frequently asked questions

## Registrable overseas maintenance liabilities


An election under section 39B to suspend collection after a change in care cannot be made in relation to a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.5.3).


## Who can apply to have the liability not enforced?


The payer and the payee can make a joint election (section 39B(3)). The payer cannot make an election alone, nor can the payee.


## When can a payer & payee make a joint election?


The payer and payee can make their joint election at any time during the 'overall non-care period'. The overall non-care period:

• starts when the payee ceases to be the main provider of ongoing daily care for the child, and
• ends when the payee resumes being the main provider of ongoing daily care, or when the liability ends if that happens first (section 39B(2)).

A payer and payee cannot make a joint election after the payee has resumed being the main provider of ongoing daily care for the child.


## For what period is the liability suspended?


The Registrar will suspend collection from the date the payee ceased to be the main provider of ongoing daily care for the child, as long as the payer and payee made their joint election to the Registrar within 28 days of that date. Otherwise, the Registrar will suspend collection from the date the payer and payee made their joint election (section 39B(3)).


A joint election has no effect if the suspension period is included in an existing low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4).


Example:Oscar (payer) calls Services Australia on 23 March to say that child Noah is now living with Oscar's parents. Noah left Jody's (payee) care on 15 March. Oscar is advised that Oscar and Jody can make a joint election for the Registrar to suspend collection of the liability for Noah, otherwise the Registrar must continue to enforce the child maintenance order. Oscar and Jody both call Services Australia on 25 March to make an election. The Registrar suspends collection from 15 March when Noah ceased living with Jody, because Oscar and Jody made their joint election within 28 days of that date.


Example:Ester (payer) calls Services Australia on 23 March to advise that child Xavier left the care of Zach (payee) on 25 November. Zach is advised that Zach and Ester can make a joint election for the Registrar to suspend collection of the liability for Xavier, otherwise the Registrar must continue to enforce the child maintenance order. Ester and Zach have no contact. Ester asks Services Australia to contact Zach about the change in care. Zach confirms the change in care on 24 March and makes an election for the Registrar to suspend collection of the liability for Xavier. As both parties have made the election there is now a joint election, effective from 24 March, the date that the joint election is complete. The election was made more than 28 days after Xavier left Zach's care, so the Registrar suspends collection from 24 March, the date of the joint election. Ester can apply to court for a variation to the court order to deal with amounts payable between 25 November and 23 March.


## Can the liability be suspended for only one child?


The payer and payee must make an election for a particular child or children for whom child maintenance is payable. The Registrar will suspend collection of the entire liability if the election is made for the only child, or all the children covered by the order or agreement. If the election is made for one, or some, of the children, the Registrar will not enforce amounts attributable to that child (or those children), but the payer must continue paying the liability for the other children who remain with the payee (section 39B(4)).


## What if the child returns to the care of the payee?


The payer or payee can elect for the Registrar to resume collecting the liability for the child when the child returns to the payee's care (section 39B(5)). The Registrar will resume collection from the date the payee resumed ongoing daily care of the child, as long as the election was made within 28 days of that date. Otherwise, the Registrar will resume collection from the date of the election (section 39B(6)).


The election to have the liability enforced again will not take effect if at that time the liability is not enforceable because of a low-income non-enforcement period (9.2.4).


## Frequently asked questions


### Can the Registrar suspend collecting a court ordered child maintenance liability when it has confirmed that the child is not in the payee's care, even though it is unable to contact the payee?


The Registrar can only suspend collection of a liability for a period when the child is not in the payee's care if both the payer and the payee make a joint election. If the payee cannot be contacted, or if the payee does not wish to make an election, the paying parent would need to make an application to court to have the order or court registered agreement varied.


### A payer advises that the child was not in the care of the payee for 6 months, but has now returned to the payee's care. Can the liability be suspended for those 6 months?


No. The election for a non-care non-enforcement period must be made during the 'overall non-care period'. This period ends when the child returns to the payee's care and the administrative option is no longer available after that time.

# 9.3.3 Notification of court orders & court registered agreements


## Context


The Registrar must be notified when an Australian court makes an order or registers an agreement that starts or varies a registrable maintenance liability. The Registrar must also be notified in relation to such orders and agreements that vary a registered maintenance liability.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 16A, section 17, section 17A, section 18, section 23, section 24, section 33, section 38A, section 38B

## Notification requirements


### Registrable maintenance liabilities


Parties to a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) must notify the Registrar within 14 days if the following occurs:

• a court makes an order or registers an agreement that starts a registrable maintenance liability (that is not a registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40))
• a court makes an order or registers an agreement that varies or otherwise affects a registrable maintenance liability of this type, and that liability is not already included in the Child Support Register (CSRC Act section 23).

When a court makes a parentage overpayment order (8.4.7), the parties to the order (for example, the former payee and payer of the child support assessment) must notify the Registrar within 14 days. They must also notify the Registrar within 14 days when a court makes an order or registers an agreement that varies a parentage overpayment order, even if the liability is not already included in the Child Support Register (CSRC Act section 23).


When a court makes a recovery order (8.4.7) in relation to a decision that the registered maintenance liability should have never existed, the parties must notify the Registrar within 14 days (CSRC Act section 23).


The exception to the notification requirement in relation to registrable maintenance liabilities is if the payee has already advised the Registrar that they do not want to register the order (CSRC Act section 23(3)).


### Registered maintenance liabilities


When a court makes an order or registers an agreement that varies or otherwise affects a registered maintenance liability, the payee to the registered maintenance liability must notify the Registrar within 14 days (CSRC Act section 33). This does not apply to registered maintenance liabilities which are not enforceable due to an election of the payee, or payee and payer jointly under CSRC Act section 38A, or a decision of the Registrar under CSRC Act section 38B.


## Form of notice or application


The notification can be made personally, by post, electronically through the website or by telephone. The Registrar will also require a copy of the relevant court order or court registered agreement.


## What does the Registrar do when given notice of, or notified about, a court order or court registered agreement?


When the payee gives notice of the court order or court registered agreement to the Registrar, the liability resulting from the order or agreement is registered for collection (CSRC Act section 24). The liability for collection is registered by entering the details of that liability into the Child Support Register.


The Registrar also maintains records of the registrable maintenance liabilities that it has been notified about, but which are not registered for collection. These records are not part of the Child Support Register.

# 9.3.2 Court orders & arrears


## Context


A court can make an order, or register a maintenance agreement, which deals with arrears accrued under an earlier order or court registered agreement. Sometimes the earlier order or agreement is already registered for collection by Services Australia.


## Act reference


## Description


The Registrar sometimes receives court orders and agreements that provide for payment of arrears (and possibly a schedule for payment of the arrears) that relate to a period before registration. The Registrar also sometimes receives court orders and agreements that vary an earlier order by reinstating arrears that were previously discharged.


Orders about arrears are not orders that give rise to a periodic maintenance liability. The order may vary the liability arising under an earlier order, or simply give instructions about the payment of the arrears.


If the Registrar receives an order about arrears in a case that is already registered for collection, the later order will be implemented by varying the Child Support Register where appropriate (see9.3.4on interpreting court orders for more information).


If the Registrar receives an order about arrears in a case that has not previously been registered for collection, the ongoing liability will be registered for collection. See7.4for information about the date from which the Registrar will collect child support.

# 9.2.4 Suspension for unemployment (low-income non-enforcement period)


## Context


The payer of certain enforceable maintenance liabilities can apply to the Registrar to suspend enforcement of the amounts payable for the period that the payer is receiving a social security pension or benefit. The enforceable maintenance liabilities for which a payer can apply for suspension of enforcement are:

• court orders or court registered agreements for child maintenance, and
• maintenance orders made by, or maintenance agreements registered by, a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction.

Low income non-enforcement periods do not apply to liabilities that arise under a child support assessment.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 17(1), section 37B, section 113A


## On this page


There is an option for the payer to apply to the Registrar to suspend enforcement of periodic amounts of maintenance payable under these liabilities, during a period in which they receive a social security pension or benefit (CSRC Act section 37B(2)).

• What are the requirements for making an application?
• When will the Registrar accept an application?
• What is the prescribed income test?
• When does a low-income non-enforcement period begin?
• When does a low-income non-enforcement period end?
• Frequently asked questions

## What are the requirements for making an application?


A payer of a registered maintenance liability to which CSRC Act section 37B applies can make an application to suspend enforcement of their liability if they have claimed, or already receive, a social security pension or benefit (CSRC Act section 37B(2)). An application may be made in relation to a past period, from when the payer commenced receiving a social security pension or benefit. A payer may therefore be able to make an application where the ongoing liability has ended and there are arrears owing.


A payer cannot make an application if their court order or court registered agreement provides for the amounts payable to reduce, directly or indirectly, when they are unemployed or their income is substantially reduced (CSRC Act section 37B(3)).


## When will the Registrar accept an application?


The Registrar will accept a payer's application if they:

• meet the requirements for making an application, and
• satisfy theprescribed income testfor the next social security payment after they make their application.

The Registrar will confirm with the Secretary that the payer receives a social security pension or benefit, and whether they satisfy the prescribed income test.


If the Registrar accepts the payer's application it will start a low-income non-enforcement period.


## What is the prescribed income test?


The payer will satisfy the prescribed income test if the total amount of income they receive from social security pensions or benefits and other ordinary income is less than the maximum basic rate of pension payable (CSRC Regs section 17).


## When does a low-income non-enforcement period begin?


The low-income non-enforcement period is a period during which no periodic amounts of maintenance will accrue as a debt due to the Registrar. It begins on the day that the payer made their application, or an earlier date decided by the Registrar (CSRC Act section 37B(4)). The low-income non-enforcement period cannot begin:

• before the payer commences to receive a social security pension or benefit
• after the day the payer lodged the application.

The Registrar will start a low-income non-enforcement period on the earliest day possible. The start date of the low-income non-enforcement period may be the date the applicant first began receiving the benefit they are receiving at the time of their application. A low-income non-enforcement period cannot be backdated to the beginning of a previous period when the applicant was in receipt of a benefit. The low-income non-enforcement period must be continuous.


However, the Registrar will not start the low-income non-enforcement period from a date that would create an overpayment for the payee. If the payer applies during a period when they satisfy the prescribed income test and they have already paid maintenance for some of this period, the Registrar will start the low-income non-enforcement period on the earliest day for which no maintenance was paid.


The payer is not liable to pay amounts to the Registrar for days in the low-income non-enforcement period. The payee, however, can institute their own proceedings to recover these amounts (8.4.6) during the low-income non-enforcement period (CSRC Act sections 37B(7A) and 113A).


Example:A payer (Konstantinos) has been unemployed since 24 February 2013. Konstantinos has been receiving a social security benefit since 5 March 2013. No maintenance payments have been made since that time. On 25 August 2013, Konstantinos makes an application for a low-income non-enforcement period. Konstantinos's court order does not have any provision for payments to be reduced during periods of unemployment. Konstantinos satisfies the prescribed income test. The low-income non-enforcement period will begin on 5 March 2013.


## When does a low-income non-enforcement period end?


The low-income non-enforcement period ends at the earliest of the following times:

• when the payer stops receiving a social security pension or benefit
• when the payer does not satisfy theprescribed income test, or
• when the liability ends.

The Registrar will review the payer's benefit or pension status periodically to ensure that they continue to meet the prescribed income test.


## Frequently asked questions


### Can the Registrar suspend enforcement of spousal maintenance when the payer is unemployed?


No, unless it is a spousal maintenance order made by, or a spousal maintenance agreement registered by, a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction.


### The payer is unemployed, but does not receive a social security benefit as their new partner is employed. Can they apply for a low-income non-enforcement period?


No. The liability is suspended when the payer receives a social security pension or benefit. A payer cannot apply for a low-income non-enforcement period unless they receive a pension or benefit. The payer would need to make an application to the court to have the order varied.


### The Registrar has accepted the payer's application for a low-income non-enforcement period. The payee believes that the payer has the capacity to pay the liability. What options are available to the payee?


The payee can object to the decision to suspend the liability. If the objection is not successful, the payee may apply to theARTfor review of the objection decision if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the objection (CSRC Act section 87(3)). Alternatively the payee could apply to the court to have the court order varied to specify an amount to be payable when the payer is in receipt of a benefit.


### What happens when a payer who has a low-income non-enforcement period failed to satisfy the prescribed income test some time ago, but is still receiving a social security pension or benefit?


The Registrar can determine multiple low-income non-enforcement periods during any period that the payer is continuously receiving a social security pension or benefit. The Registrar will end the low-income non-enforcement period from the date the payer failed to satisfy the prescribed income test and start another low-income non-enforcement period from the date the payer next satisfied the prescribed income test.


### Can a payer apply for a low-income non-enforcement period for a period when they were previously in receipt of a social security benefit?


No. A payer must be in receipt of, or have claimed a social security pension or benefit, on the day that they apply for a low-income non-enforcement period. The Registrar can determine a commencement day for the low-income non-enforcement period that is earlier than the date of the payer's application, but it cannot be before the date the payer commenced to receive a social security pension or benefit on the later occasion. If the payer failed to apply for a low-income non-enforcement period during previous periods of unemployment, they can seek a variation to their court order for that period.


### Can the Registrar continue to collect arrears of child support during a low-income non-enforcement period?


Yes. The payer is not required to pay child support in relation to the days in the low-income non-enforcement period, but they are still liable to pay child support in relation to the days before the low-income non-enforcement period. The Registrar can take enforcement action for arrears, including action to have deductions made from the payer's social security pension or benefit (7.4.4.10).

# 9.2.2 New order or court registered agreement that affects a liability


## Context


The Registrar must vary the Register when a copy of a new court order or court registered agreement that affects a liability is received.


## Act references


## Description


The Registrar must vary the Register to give effect to the terms of a new order or court registered agreement that affects a registered maintenance liability. The liability will be varied from the date required by the order or agreement. The date that the Registrar received the order is not relevant.


The actual wording of the order is of critical importance. The Registrar will take care to understand how the new order affects the original liability. Where the original liability was based on a court order or court registered agreement, the requirements of the original order or agreement need to be properly understood to correctly apply the variation required by the new order (9.3.4).


Example:The Registrar registered a court ordered liability in 2012. The payee provides a new order on 12 October 2021, which was made in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia on 22 September 2021. The order states that the previous order is varied so that the payer is to pay $75 per week for each of the children named in the order from 1 September 2021. The Registrar varies the Register to show that the liability is $75 per child per week from 1 September 2021.

# 9.3.1 Periodic amounts payable to the payee


## Context


A registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40) must be either a liability to pay a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) of maintenance for a child or a spouse, or a recovery order (1.1.R.30). The payee (1.1.P.30) of a registrable maintenance liability is the person who would be entitled to collect the payments under the order if the liability were not registered for collection.


This page discusses liabilities to pay periodic maintenance to a payee. See8.4.7for a discussion of registrable maintenance liabilities that are recovery orders.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 4, section 17, section 17A, section 18, section 30

## Payee of a registrable maintenance liability


A court order or court registered agreement for maintenance creates a liability for one person (the payer (1.1.P.40)) to provide financial support to another person (the payee). The terms of the order or agreement will make it clear who is entitled to the associated payments. The payee of a child maintenance order will usually be the parent or other person providing ongoing daily care for the child, or the children. The payee of a spousal maintenance order (1.1.S.50) will usually be the spouse, or former spouse, of the payer.


## Amounts payable to the payee


A registrable maintenance liability must be in the form of periodic amount payable to the payee or a recovery order (8.4.7). An order may specify that payments be made to the payee's bank account and occasionally to a third party acting for the payee, such as a solicitor or trustee.


David is to pay Jane's spousal maintenance of $120 per week. Such payment is to be deposited to Jane's bank account.


Esmeralda is to pay Mark child maintenance for their child Esma in the amount of $74 per week, by depositing said amount into a trust account for Esma under Esmeralda and Mark's joint control.


A provision in a court order that specifies how child maintenance is to be paid to the payee does not prevent the Registrar from registering the order. When the liability is registered, the amounts payable under the order become debts due to the Commonwealth (CSRC Act section 30). Once an order is registered for collection, the provisions of CSRC Act section 30 override any payment instructions in the order. Amounts payable under the order are payable to the Registrar in accordance with the particulars in the Child Support Register. The Registrar then transfers collected amounts to the payee.


## Court ordered amounts that are not registrable


The following court ordered amounts are not registrable maintenance liabilities:

• A court order or court registered maintenance agreement that requires the payer to make payments to a third party on behalf of the payee.
• An Australian court order or court registered maintenance agreement that requires the payer to make payments to the child for the maintenance of that child.

Philomena is to pay $850 per month to the Territories Bank in satisfaction of Ranald's mortgage repayments, the first such payment to be made on 15 September.


Sunita is to make contributions at the family rate to Allied Health Insurance for Michael and the children Sandra and Derry.


Eva is responsible for payment of all fees associated with Malai's attendance at the Valley School until Malai completes secondary schooling.


Shane is to pay child Oscar for the maintenance of child Oscar the sum of $100 per fortnight until the child completes their tertiary education.


## Periodic amounts


A periodic amount is an amount to be paid at a weekly, monthly, annual or other periodic interval (CSRC Act section 4). A periodic amount is expressed in terms that require payments of a regular amount on a recurring basis.


These clauses clearly state periodic amounts:

• $200 for each fortnight
• $1,000 every 6 months
• $400 each quarter.

A clause with instructions about varying a stated periodic amount is also acceptable:

• $50 per week but subject to adjustment on 1 January each year to reflect changes in theCPI.

An order or court registered agreement for a periodic amount does not have to specify the actual dollar amount of payment. An order or court registered agreement can be implemented if it contains terms which would enable the Registrar to calculate an amount that will be unchanged for a reasonable period of time and paid on a recurring basis.


Orders or agreements which require the payer to make payments to the payee that are equivalent to the payee's mortgage or rent payments, house rates, health insurance or school fees are orders for periodic amounts. These are recurring payments at a fixed amount that may vary according to changes in interest rates or when premiums increase. However, where an order or agreement requires the payer to meet these payments directly, the payee is not entitled to payments under the order, so they are not a registrable maintenance liability.


Orders applying the assessment formula can give rise to a periodic amount. See9.3.4.30for more information.

# 9.3.4.10 Order requiring payment to the payee


## Context


A court order or court registered maintenance agreement may specify that payments be made to the payee's (1.1.P.30) bank account or to a third party such as a solicitor or trustee. Such a provision in an order does not prevent the order or court registered agreement being registered for collection.


## Act references


## Description


A court order or court registered agreement for maintenance creates a liability for one person (the payer (1.1.P.40)) to provide financial support to another person. The terms of the order will make it clear who is entitled to the payments under the order.


Example:Darius is to pay Carolina spousal maintenance of $120 per week.


Carolina is to pay Darius child maintenance for their child Cameron in the amount of $74 per week.


Darius is to pay child maintenance to Cameron of $83 per week.


A court order may also specify how child support is to be paid.


Example:Joseph is to pay Mary spousal maintenance of $120 per week. Such payment is to be deposited to Mary's account with the XXX Bank.


Mary is to pay Joseph child maintenance for their child Bobby in the amount of $74 per week, by depositing said amount into a trust account for Bobby under Mary and Joseph's joint control.


A provision in a court order that specifies how child support is to be paid to the payee does not prevent the Registrar from registering the order. However, when an order is registered for collection, the amounts payable under the order become debts due to the Commonwealth (section 30). Therefore, once an order is registered for collection, the provisions of section 30 override any payment instructions in the order. Instead, amounts payable under the order are payable in accordance with the particulars of the Register.


A court order or court registered maintenance agreement that requires the payer to make payments to a third party on behalf of the payee is not a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40). This is discussed in more detail in9.3.1.

# 9.3.4.20 Orders discharging late payment penalties


## Orders discharging LPPs


A court exercising family law jurisdiction has no power to deal withLPPs (1.1.L.20). Therefore the Registrar is not required to give effect to an order that is invalid.


Despite this, the Registrar sometimes receives court orders made in proceedings between parents that direct the Registrar to reduce or remit LPPs. The Registrar will consider whether it is appropriate to reduce or remit the LPPs. The Registrar will consider any evidence produced to the court about the payer's financial position when deciding if there are special circumstances that make it fair and reasonable to reduce or remit the LPP (section 68(1)(c)).


See8.2for more details on when LPPs can be remitted.

# 9.3.4.30 Orders applying the assessment formula


## Context


A court order or court registered agreement may require payment of child support (1.1.C.60) at a rate worked out using the provisions of the CSA Act.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 4, section 17


## Description


A court may make an order under the FL Act that says the periodic amount (1.1.P.80) of child support is to be worked out by reference to the CSA Act. These orders are made in cases where a child support assessment (1.1.C.70) cannot be made under the CSA Act as the parents, non-parent carer, or the child do not meet the eligibility requirements of that Act.


An order which merely states that the CSA Act or Part 5 of that Act is to apply does not contain sufficient information to calculate a periodic amount. Nor does an order which says the Registrar is to work out the rate of child support, but does not specify how the Registrar should do this.


Example:'Alfie is to pay Venera such amount as is determined by the Registrar.'This order does not contain sufficient information to work out a periodic amount payable to the payee and is not a registrable maintenance liability (1.1.R.40).


'Alfie is to pay Venera an amount determined by the Registrar using the formula in the CSA Act.'This order contains sufficient information to work out a periodic amount payable to the payee and is a registrable maintenance liability.


It is important to note that when the Registrar registers a court order that applies the CSA Act formula it is not making an assessment under Part 5 of the Act.


The Registrar will calculate the periodic amount when an order is registered by applying the formula contained in section 35 of the CSA Act. The Registrar will not apply the other formulas contained in Division 2 of Part 5 of the CSA Act (non-parent carer/s and/or multiple child support cases) unless the order specifically requires this. The Registrar will determine the parents' child support income amounts under Subdivision B of Division 3 but the provisions of Division 7 (the estimate of income provisions) cannot apply.


The provisions of the CSA Act that require the Registrar to make new assessments at the start of newCSPs (1.1.C.150) do not apply to orders under the FL Act. The Registrar will only vary the periodic amount if this is specifically required by the terms of the order, and the order states how it is to be done. Otherwise, the amount originally calculated will apply for as long as the order is in force. A parent wishing to change his or her liability due to a change in circumstances must apply to a court for a variation of the order.


Example:Louis and Sarah separated in 1997. Sarah has a court order made 17 May 2007 which says:'Louis is to pay maintenance to Sarah for the child Lea in accordance with the CSA Act formula.The liability is to be calculated annually, based on Louis's income for the last financial year.Each year the amount payable for the period 17 May to 16 May in the next year is calculated, based on the payer's taxable income for the previous year.'


This is a registrable maintenance liability and the Registrar will review the amount payable each year.

WORD COUNT: 857

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 9.3.4.40 Orders dealing with arrears


## Context


A court can make an order, or register an agreement, which deals with arrears (1.1.A.100) accrued under an earlier order or court registered agreement. Sometimes the earlier order or agreement has already been registered for collection by the Registrar when the court makes the later order.


## Act reference


CSRC Actsection 17A, section 18A, section 28, section 30, section 36


## On this page


Services Australia can receive court orders and agreements which provide for payment of arrears. These court orders may:

• set out a schedule for payment
• provide for payment of arrears which relate to a period before registration, or
• vary an earlier order by reinstating arrears which were previously discharged.

Orders about arrears are not orders that cause a periodic maintenance liability. The order may vary the liability arising under an earlier order, or simply give instructions about the payment of the arrears.

• Orders that give instructions about the payment of arrears
• Orders that vary the amount of arrears under an earlier order
• Arrears under a registrable overseas maintenance liability
• Orders that start a child support liability retrospectively

## Orders that give instructions about the payment of arrears


When the Registrar registers an order for collection, the amounts payable under the order become debts due to the Commonwealth (CSRC Act section 30). Once an order is registered for collection, the provisions of section 30 override any payment instructions in the order.


Where an order sets out a schedule for payment of lump sum arrears which arose during a child support enforcement period, the Registrar cannot be bound by the terms of the order. However, the Registrar will take note of the arrangement and attempt to reach a payment arrangement consistent with the order. This type of order does not prevent the Registrar from intercepting an income tax refund (Field and Field(1991) FLC 92-227), from negotiating a different arrangement with the payer (1.1.P.40) at a later date if their circumstances change significantly, or from taking other enforcement action if appropriate.


## Orders that vary the amount of arrears under an earlier order


### No earlier order registered


Services Australia sometimes receives court orders which provide for payment of arrears arising under an order which has never been registered for collection. The order may also vary the ongoing maintenance liability. The Registrar will register the ongoing liability for collection. However, the Registrar cannot register the arrears for collection because they do not relate to a child support enforcement period. See7.4.1.20for information about the day the liability first becomes enforceable.


### Earlier order registered & arrears relate to period of registration


Where an order varies the arrears for a registration period to a particular amount, the Registrar will vary the Register to reflect the order.


### Earlier order registered but arrears relate to a period before registration


Where the arrears amount specified in the order relates to both the pre- and post-registration periods, the Registrar must ignore any variation to arrears for the pre-registration period.


If the court specifies the period to which the arrears amount relates, the Registrar will act on that basis in apportioning the arrears to the pre- and post-registration periods. The Registrar will vary only the arrears relating to the period the order was registered for collection.


Where the court order does not specify the period to which the arrears relate, the Registrar will assume that the earliest debt is being discharged first. This means that the debt for the pre-registration period is discharged before the debt for the post-registration period. The arrears amount is maintained in the Register.


## Arrears under a registrable overseas maintenance liability


A registrable overseas maintenance liability (1.1.O.40) can include arrears of periodic amounts of child maintenance or spousal maintenance payable under an overseas court order, court registered maintenance agreement, maintenance assessment or agency reimbursement liability (CSRC Act section 18A(4)).


For more information in relation to registrable overseas maintenance liabilities, see1.5.3on overseas orders, court registered agreements and assessments.


## Orders that start a child support liability retrospectively


Sometimes a court will make an order for the liability to be payable from a day sometime before the order being made (for example, the date of the parent's application to the court). This is not the same as specifying an amount of arrears. If the payee (1.1.P.30) applies for registration of the liability within 14 days of the day the order was made, the Registrar will enforce the liability from the start date ordered by the court. If notified more than 14 days after the order was made, the Registrar must decide from which day the liability is enforceable. See7.4.1.20for information about the day the liability first becomes enforceable.

TITLE: 9.3.4.50 Registering some clauses in an order & not others (severability)
WORD COUNT: 406

The information contained in this publication is intended only as a guide to relevant legislation/policy. The information is accurate as at the date listed at the bottom of the page, but may be subject to change. To discuss individual circumstances please contactServices Australia.


# 9.3.4.50 Registering some clauses in an order & not others (severability)


## Context


A court order or court registered maintenance agreement may contain clauses that cannot be registered under the child support legislation. If the clauses are severable, the Registrar will register the acceptable parts of the court order or agreement only.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 17, section 17A, section 18, section 18A


## Description


A court order or court registered maintenance agreement which contains clauses that can be accepted and registered under the child support legislation may also contain other clauses that cannot. The Registrar will register the acceptable parts of the court order or agreement only if the unacceptable clauses are 'severable' (that is, registering only the acceptable clauses does not change the essential nature of the order or agreement). The Registrar will refuse the application for registration of the entire order or agreement if the unacceptable clauses are not severable.


For example, a court order may include a clause discharging an original order for maintenance and a clause providing for payments at a different rate from that stated in the original order. The intention of the later order is to vary the rate of payment of the earlier order rather than to discharge the maintenance liability entirely. However, if the Registrar cannot give effect to the clause providing for payment of child maintenance at a different rate, (for example, because it was not for a periodic amount (1.1.P.80) payable to the payee (9.3.1)(1.1.P.30)), then the Registrar cannot give effect to the clause which discharges the original orders. The Registrar would therefore refuse the application to register the entire order or agreement.


An example of severability might be where a court order provides for a periodic amount of maintenance but also contains a clause regarding exchange of property. In this instance the Registrar can register the periodic amount of maintenance and 'sever' it from the property clause. In this instance severing the property clause does not change the intent of the periodic amount of maintenance.

# 9.3.4.60 Other common provisions in court orders & agreements


## Context


The words in court orders and court registered agreements have their ordinary meaning. If clauses are unclear or ambiguous, the Registrar will interpret common terms and provisions consistently.


Some of the content of this page is relevant to child support (1.1.C.60) agreements under the CSA Act (Part 6) and those references are included.


## Act references


CSRC Actsection 17, section 18, section 18A


## On this page


The Registrar will interpret the following common terms and provisions in the following way.

• Previous orders discharged, vacated, set aside or nullified
• Orders setting a rate of child support for more than one child
• Unemployment clauses
• Self-supporting children
• Children in full-time education
• Interpreting overseas court orders

## Previous orders discharged, vacated, set aside or nullified


Orders that vary previous orders are often worded in this way. In some cases, the intention of the court and, therefore, the date of effect of the order is unclear. This can be especially important when a sequence of orders have been made over a period of years that vary the previous orders.


### Discharged


This means the whole order or specified clauses within the order are ended. The discharging order may specify a date when the discharge becomes effective. Otherwise, the order or clauses in the order cease to have effect from the date of the discharging order.


### Vacated


The whole order or specified clauses in the order are left vacant, and are ended. The vacating order may specify a date when the order or clause vacated ceases to have effect. Otherwise, they will cease to have effect from the date of the vacating order.


### Set aside


This is a variation that ends a clause or an order from the date the original order was made, or from a later date if specified in the setting aside order. In contrast to the above, if no date is specified the order or clauses are set aside from the date of the original order.


Where an order or clause has had retrospective effect is later set aside on appeal, the original order or clause that had retrospective effect is ended from the date/s the original order or clause first took effect. It may be set aside from a later date if specified in the setting aside order.


### Nullity


This is a declaration that an order or clause is legally void or inoperable. This means the order or clause is considered never to have had any effect and must be treated as if it were never made.


## Orders setting a rate of child support for more than one child


A court order that sets a rate of child support (1.1.C.60) for more than one child should state how much is payable for each of the children. This will allow the Registrar to apportion the amount between the children. When the court order or court registered agreement ends in relation to one or more of the children and it does not specify an amount for each child, the Register will continue to reflect the full amount payable under that order or agreement.


Example:An order states that $100 per week each for the 2 children of the marriage is payable making a total of $200 per week. The eldest child reaches 18 years of age and the liability is reduced to $100 per week.


Example:An order states that $200 per week is payable for the children of the marriage. There are 2 children and when the eldest reaches 18 years, $200 will remain payable as it is not clear how the total amount was to be apportioned between them.


## Unemployment clauses


Court orders, court registered agreements and child support agreements can suspend or reduce the liability when a parent (1.1.P.10) is unemployed. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the problem with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will take the following issues into account when interpreting the court order.


For the liability to be varied when a parent becomes unemployed, the Registrar must be able to determine the person's employment status. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Registrar will accept that a parent is unemployed if they receive an income tested benefit or pension. Where the parent does not receive a benefit or pension, Services Australia will consider statements made by the parent and documentary evidence such as an employment separation certificate.


Court orders, court registered agreements and child support agreements may allow for a reduced liability during periods when a parent is in receipt of 'unemployment benefits'. A difficulty arises when a parent is not employed but is not receiving an unemployment benefit or is receiving another type of benefit. A broad interpretation will be given to the term 'unemployment benefits'. The Registrar may apply such a clause where the person is receiving an income tested benefit or pension as a result of not being in employment (for example, disability support pension). However, a parent is still employed if they are receiving benefits but their employment has not been terminated.


A parent may be unable to work because of a work-related injury and receive periodic compensation payments. The Registrar will determine if the parent is still employed by their employer. If the employment contract has been terminated, the Registrar will accept that the person is unemployed despite being in receipt of payments that may be greater than those payable to unemployed welfare beneficiaries.


A court can make an order that varies a parent's liability in a current period of unemployment, or one that applies during any period of unemployment.


Example:An order states that the amount payable is to be reduced to $10 per week until Anthea gains full-time employment. This applies to Anthea's current period of unemployment.


Example:An order states that the amount payable is to be reduced to $10 per week during periods when Linda is not in full-time employment. This applies whenever Linda is not in full-time employment after the date of the order.


## Self-supporting children


Court orders, court registered agreements and child support agreements sometimes contain a provision providing for a reduction in child support payable if the child is self-supporting. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the circumstances with both parents to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will interpret the clause in the following way.


The Registrar must be satisfied that the child is self-supporting. The Registrar will not consider whether the child is capable of being self-supporting or should be self-supporting.


In determining whether a child is self-supporting, the Registrar will determine the child's actual income and whether the child is paying for their basic living expenses without financial support from another person. Basic living expenses include accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs. The Registrar will disregard social security payments the child is receiving except where the child is not living with the payee (1.1.P.30). If the child is also making lifestyle choices that would not be available without an independent source of income (for example, buying a car), the child is more likely to be self-supporting.


If the child is living away from home, the Registrar will consider whether the payee continues to have care and control of the child or whether the child is living independently from the payee and meeting their own costs. The Registrar will consider whether there has been a terminating event.


If the child continues to live with the payee, they will be self-supporting if they pay a reasonable contribution towards household expenses including accommodation, food, utilities and transport costs, or if they pay board equal to this amount to the payee. If the child is living with the payee but not contributing towards those household expenses, or is only making a nominal contribution, the Registrar will find that the child is not self-supporting.


The Registrar will not attempt to obtain this information from a child under the age of 18 years and will request evidence from the parents to make a decision.


## Children in full-time education


Court orders, court registered agreements and child support agreements sometimes state that they are to operate until a child ceases to be in full-time education or until they finish a particular level of education, such as secondary schooling. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, Services Australia will discuss the circumstances with both parents to try to obtain agreement about the intention of the clause. If the parents are unable to agree on the intention of the clause, the Registrar will consider the following issues when interpreting the clause.


### Tertiary education


Tertiary education involves a distinct qualification, an associate diploma, diploma or degree, rather than matriculation or vocational training. This is usually how orders for children over 18 years are worded. Associate diplomas can be undertaken at some TAFE Colleges and Services Australia would normally contact the college concerned to ascertain the level given by the college.


### Secondary education


Institutions such as TAFE offer a range of courses from secondary education, vocational and pre-vocational training as well as certificate, pre-tertiary and associate diploma courses. If the parents disagree about the level of education the child is undertaking, Services Australia will ask the payee for information about the child's student status.


Where a child who is under 18 is attending secondary school, or undertaking a secondary level course at a TAFE college, the Registrar will accept this to be secondary education. Services Australia may contact the TAFE college to confirm this.


### Full-time education


Where the child has finished secondary school and is attending an institution that considers the child as a full-time student, the Registrar will generally accept that the child is in full-time education.


### Period between end of secondary school & commencing tertiary education


Parents may disagree about child support in the period between a child finishing their secondary education and commencing a full-time tertiary course. The Registrar will accept that the child is in full-time education in the holiday period if the child has indicated an intention to continue their education (for example, by applying for a place and then enrolling in a tertiary course). The holiday period extends from the day after the final day of secondary school (as early as October) to the commencement day of the next academic year (the following February or March).


A child may also apply for entry into a tertiary course but not win a place or may be offered a place but not enrol in the course. In these cases, the Registrar will treat the child as being in full-time education until the failure to gain a place is notified or until the final date for enrolment is passed, as long as the child has indicated an intention to continue in education until that time.


A child may defer a course of study for a period. During the deferral period, the child is not enrolled in a course of full-time study. The deferral period will extend from the day the application for deferral of the course is accepted until the day the student resumes the deferred course.


In determining the child's education status, the Registrar will not consider any income received by the child unless the court order or court registered agreement makes this relevant.


## Interpreting overseas court orders


Where a court order is made by a judicial authority of a reciprocating jurisdiction (1.1.R.10), the information in this chapter can be used as a general guide to interpret the order. Ultimately, the interpretation of an overseas order is a matter for the central authority of the reciprocating jurisdiction (1.5.1) in which the order was made. Where a clause is ambiguous or uncertain, or where there is disagreement between the parents as to the correct interpretation of an overseas order, the Registrar will seek clarification from the relevant central authority (1.1.C.40).


For more information on administering overseas maintenance liabilities see1.5.3on overseas orders, court registered agreements and assessments.
