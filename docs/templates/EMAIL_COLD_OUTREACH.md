**Subject:** Quick way to identify complex child support cases

---

Hi [Lawyer Name],

I've built a calculator at auschildsupport.com that helps Australian parents understand their child support assessments.

The interesting part for family lawyers: it automatically flags cases that need professional help - things like income departures, care percentage disputes, or special circumstances that trigger Change of Assessment.

When it identifies a complex case, I can refer that lead to your firm for $50 per qualified referral.

Try the calculator yourself: auschildsupport.com

How it works:
✓ Parent uses calculator (free, no signup)
✓ Complex case detected → they click "Get Legal Help"
✓ I email you their details with full case summary
✓ You contact them directly to schedule consultation
✓ $50 per lead, billed monthly via Stripe

Interested in receiving leads from [City/Region]? Reply and I'll send you the partnership agreement.

Best,
