# Exclusive Partner Outreach Plan: Sage Family Lawyers

**Status:** High Priority Target
**Context:** Sage is currently running ~38 active Google Ads, making them the most aggressive "Challenger" firm in the market. They are the ideal candidate for the "Client-Funded Ads" model.

---

## 1. Target Intelligence
* **Firm Name:** Sage Family Lawyers
* **Size:** ~7 Lawyers (Perfect "Goldilocks" size: big budget, small bureaucracy).
* **Location:** Melbourne CBD (Level 4/533 Little Lonsdale St).
* **Why Them?**
    * **38 Active Ads:** They are already spending significant money on Google Ads. They understand CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) and are likely looking for ways to lower it.
    * **Challenger Profile:** They are competing against the "Big End of Town" and are likely hungrier for an edge than the established giants.

---

## 2. Decision Makers
*Do not email the general admin address.*

* **Primary Target:** **Paul Ross** (Principal)
    * *Why:* Male partners in boutique firms often handle the operational/financial marketing decisions.
    * *Email Pattern:* Likely `pross@sagefamilylawyers.com.au` or `paul.ross@sagefamilylawyers.com.au`
* **Secondary Target:** **Charlotte Geddes** (Principal)
    * *Why:* If Paul doesn't respond, Charlotte is the next logical decision-maker.

## 3. The Offer (The "No Brainer" Pilot)
[cite_start]*Ref: Pivot Plan, Track B [cite: 52-57]*

* **Financials:** They fund $500 in *their own* Google Ads account (Zero risk for you).
* **Product:** You rebrand the calculator as "Powered by Sage Family Lawyers."
* **Exclusivity:** They get **100% of the qualified leads** generated in Melbourne for 4 weeks.
* **Value Prop:** They get a custom pre-qualification tool (which would cost $10k+ to build) for free, just to test the lead quality.

## 4. Execution Strategy

### Step 1: The "Sniper" Pitch Email
*Send this Tuesday morning (approx 10:00 AM) for best open rates.*

**Subject:** Exclusive pilot: Pre-qualified child support leads for Sage Family Lawyers

> Hi Paul,
>
> I noticed Sage is running about 38 active ads on Google right now—you're clearly the most active firm in the Melbourne market, so I'm reaching out to you first.
>
> I've built a new child support calculator (auschildsupport.com) that identifies complex cases (hidden income, self-employed payers) before they ever speak to a lawyer.
>
> I'm looking for **one** firm in Melbourne to pilot an exclusive partnership.
>
> **The Deal:**
> * **You fund a small $500 test** in your own Google Ads account (zero risk to you, you keep the data).
> * **I rebrand the calculator** as *"Powered by Sage Family Lawyers."*
> * **All qualified leads** go exclusively to your inbox for 4 weeks.
>
> **Why this works for Sage:**
> * **Lower CPA:** These aren't cold clicks; they are parents who have already spent 10 minutes calculating their liability.
> * **Exclusivity:** Your competitors (Clancy, Coote, etc.) won't see these leads.
> * **Zero Dev Cost:** You get a custom pre-qualification tool without building it.
>
> Are you open to a 10-min demo to see the complexity filter in action?
>
> Thanks,
> Sam
> auschildsupport.com

### Step 2: The Follow-Up (T+3 Days)
*If no reply by Friday.*

**Subject:** Re: Exclusive pilot

> Hi Paul,
>
> Just floating this to the top of your inbox.
>
> To be clear, I'm not selling SEO or leads. I'm offering a free tool implementation to help lower the CPA on the 30+ ads you're already running.
>
> If Sage isn't interested, do you mind if I approach Clancy & Triado? I'd prefer to work with you given your current market presence, but I need to find a pilot partner this week.
>
> Best,
> Sam

### Step 3: The Demo Call Script (15 Mins)
*Goal: Get them to say "Yes" to the $500 test.*

1.  **The Hook:** "I saw your ads and realized you're paying for clicks from 'tire kickers' who just want free info. My tool filters them out."
2.  **The Demo:** Share screen. Show the "Change of Assessment" reasons. [cite_start]Explain how checking "Self Employed" flags them as a High Value Lead. [cite: 67-68]
3.  [cite_start]**The Control:** "You don't pay me anything. You just allocate $500 of your *existing* budget to a new campaign that I manage for you." [cite: 70]
4.  **The Close:** "If we turn this on for 4 weeks and you get 5 qualified consults, would you consider that a win?"
