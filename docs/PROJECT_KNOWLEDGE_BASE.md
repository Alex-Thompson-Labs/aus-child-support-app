# Project Knowledge Base & Context Brief

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18

---

## Project Overview

**Child Support Calculator** - A comprehensive Expo/React Native web application for calculating child support payments according to Australian family law guidelines, with integrated B2B lead generation for family law firms.

**Business Model:** Free calculator → Complexity detection → Lawyer lead generation ($50/qualified lead)

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Framework & Stack**

- **Platform**: Expo (React Native for Web + Mobile)
- **Router**: `expo-router` with async routes for code splitting
- **Language**: TypeScript/TSX
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `expo-print` & `expo-sharing` (dynamically imported for admin features)
  - `@expo/vector-icons` (optimized imports)
  - Analytics: Google Analytics (react-ga4) + Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights

### **Backend & Database Infrastructure**

- **Database**: Supabase (Sydney region, free tier)
  - Encrypted lead storage with full calculation history
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
  - Privacy Act 1988 compliant (consent tracking, audit trails, deletion capability)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (admin-only access)
- **Automation**: Make.com (formerly Integromat)
  - Webhook integration with Supabase
  - Lead notification workflow: User submits enquiry → Supabase → Make.com → Email notification
  - Real-time alerts for new lead submissions
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Login at `/admin/login` (password protected)
  - Dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`
  - Lead list with search/filter capabilities
  - Status management (new/reviewing/sent/converted/lost)
  - Full lead details view with lawyer assignment tracking
  - Mobile-optimized for on-the-go management
- **Lead Management Workflow**:
  - Parent submits inquiry → Saved to Supabase database with full calculation history
  - Admin reviews leads in dashboard for quality and routing
  - Lead status tracking for billing and conversion metrics
- **SEO Strategy**:
  - Blog routes (`app/blog/*`) utilize `+html.tsx` for proper meta tag injection and static rendering.
  - Goal: Ensure indexability of content to drive organic traffic for Phase 3A validation.
- **Privacy & Compliance**:
  - Privacy policy published at auschildsupport.com/privacy
  - Mandatory consent checkbox on inquiry form
  - Data rights supported (access, correction, deletion)
  - All lead access and status changes logged for audit trail

## 🎯 **Core Features**

### **1. Child Support Calculator**

The primary and only screen in the application.

#### **ATI Input**

- Consolidated card for both Parent A & Parent B Adjusted Taxable Income
- Single input interface for both parents

#### **Care Arrangements**

- **Layout**: 2x2 grid on mobile (Parent A/B side-by-side, Period/Age Range below)
- **Visibility**: Both parent care percentages visible by default
- **Auto-balancing**: Percentages automatically balance to 100% across periods (week/fortnight/year)
- **Dispute Detection**: Trigger system for shared care scenarios
- **Bug Fix**: Dispute zone trigger now correctly deactivates when care percentages change

#### **Relevant Dependents**

- Popover interface with persistent state
- **UX Fix**: Popover stays open during input interaction (closes only on explicit toggle)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Vertical stacking to prevent horizontal overflow
- Multi-input fields for dependent details

### **2. Assessment Results**

Detailed calculation breakdowns with comprehensive tooltips:

- **Income Metrics**: ATI, SSA (Self-Support Amount), CSI (Child Support Income)
- **Percentage Calculations**: Care/Cost/Child Support Percentages
- **Liability**: Calculations with rate applications
- **Reference Values**: FAR, MAR, Combined CSI
- **Smart Conversion Footer**: Lead generation CTA based on complexity detection

### **3. Lead Capture System**

- **LawyerInquiryScreen**: Main inquiry form (`app/lawyer-inquiry.tsx`)
- **EnquiryForm/ContactModal**: Conditional fields based on user context
  - Court date input (conditional on selected reasons)
  - Financial issue choice chips
  - Dynamic validation
- **PDF Export**: `exportLeadPDF.ts` for professional use

### **4. Special Circumstances Entry**

- **SpecialCircumstancesScreen**: Standalone screen (`app/special-circumstances.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Allows users from blog links to skip the calculator and select complex factors directly.
- **Direct Mode**: Navigates to `/lawyer-inquiry` with `mode=direct`, which enables manual income inputs for users who haven't used the calculator.

### **5. Court Order Scanner (New)**

- **CourtOrderToolScreen**: Standalone tool (`app/court-order-tool.tsx`)
- **Functionality**:
  - Upload Family Court Order (PDF/Image)
  - AI-powered analysis to extract care schedules
  - Generates "Care Calendar" and calculates exact night counts
  - Detects potential savings opportunities (e.g., travel costs, specific clauses)
- **Tech**: Uses Supabase Edge Functions (`analyze-order`) for processing.

### **6. Admin Features**

- Located in `app/admin/` directory
- Heavy libraries (expo-print/sharing) dynamically imported to reduce main bundle size

---

## 🎨 **Design & UX Priorities**

### **Accessibility (A11y)**

Recent improvements to meet WCAG standards:

- ✅ All `role="switch"` elements have `aria-checked` attributes
- ✅ `accessibilityRole` on interactive elements
- ✅ `accessibilityLabel`/`accessibilityLabelledBy` on inputs
- ✅ Grouped list items with `accessible={true}`
- ✅ **Contrast Fix**: Blog button uses `#0056b3` (not `#007AFF`)

### **Responsive Design**

Mobile-first approach with specific optimizations:

- Grid layouts adapt: 2x2 on mobile, flexible on desktop
- Input fields sized for easy tapping (touch-friendly)
- Vertical stacking to prevent horizontal overflow
- **Form Spacing**: Reduced margins (e.g., `my-3` vs `my-6`) for compact, scannable forms

### **Performance Optimizations**

Lighthouse Performance score improvements:

- **Code Splitting**: Async routes via `expo-router` plugin
- **Lazy Loading**: Heavy components wrapped in React `Suspense`
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized library imports
- **Dynamic Imports**: Admin-only libraries (expo-print/sharing)
- **Bundle Size Reduction**: ~550KB eliminated from unmapped code
  - ~400KB from `@expo/vector-icons` optimization
  - ~150KB from dynamic admin library imports

---

## 🐛 **Recent Bug Fixes & Refactors**

### **Fixed Issues** (Last 30 Days)

1. ✅ **Shared Care Trigger**: Dispute zone trigger now deactivates correctly when care percentages change
2. ✅ **Relevant Dependents Popover**: Stays open during input interaction (no auto-close)
3. ✅ **Mobile Horizontal Overflow**: Resolved in Relevant Dependents section
4. ✅ **Care Component Grid**: 2x2 grid enforced on mobile browsers
5. ✅ **Switch Accessibility**: All switch elements have proper `aria-checked` attributes
6. ✅ **Blog Button Contrast**: Improved to `#0056b3` for WCAG compliance
7. ✅ **Navigation Issue**: LawyerInquiryScreen routing fixed
8. ✅ **Form Spacing**: SpecialCircumstancesForm spacing tightened

### **Performance Improvements**

- Lighthouse Performance score optimized via bundle size reduction
