## Article Content

If you want to **object to child support assessment** decisions in Australia, you're not alone. Every year, thousands of Australian parents challenge their assessments because they don't accurately reflect their circumstances.

![Object to child support assessment - Australian parent reviewing documents](object-to-child-support-assessment.jpg)

The good news is that you have options. Services Australia provides formal processes when you want to **object to child support assessment** calculations that produce an unfair result.

This guide explains exactly how to object to child support assessment decisions in Australia, including the different pathways available, timeframes you need to meet, and what evidence you'll need to support your case.

## Understanding Your Child Support Assessment

Before you object, it's important to understand how your assessment was calculated. Child Support uses an 8-step formula that considers:

- Both parents' taxable income
- The cost of raising children (based on age and number)
- The percentage of care each parent provides
- Any relevant dependants in new relationships

The formula is designed to be fair in most situations, but it can't account for every family's unique circumstances. That's why knowing how to **object to child support assessment** decisions is so important.

**[Use our free Child Support Calculator](https://auschildsupport.com/)** to see exactly how your assessment was calculated and whether the numbers match what Services Australia has determined.

## Two Ways to Object to Child Support Assessment Decisions

When you decide to **object to child support assessment** calculations, there are two main pathways:

### 1. Objection (for Administrative Errors)

An **objection** is the right approach when you believe Services Australia made an error in processing your assessment. This includes situations where:

- Your income was recorded incorrectly
- Care percentages don't match your actual arrangements
- A relevant dependent wasn't included
- Information was entered wrongly into the system
- You weren't properly notified about a decision

**Timeframe:** You must lodge an objection within **28 days** of receiving the decision you're objecting to. In some cases, late objections may be accepted if you have a good reason for the delay.

**How to lodge:** Call Services Australia on 131 272 or submit your objection through your myGov account. You'll need to explain what error was made and provide evidence to support your claim.

### 2. Change of Assessment (for Special Circumstances)

A **Change of Assessment (COA)** is the right approach when your circumstances are genuinely different from what the formula assumes. This is more common than administrative objections.

The Child Support (Assessment) Act provides **10 specific reasons** (called "grounds") for seeking a Change of Assessment:

1. **High costs of contact** - You spend significant money travelling to see your children
2. **Special needs care costs** - Your child has a disability or medical condition requiring expensive care
3. **High costs of caring/educating** - Private school fees or exceptional educational costs
4. **Child's income or resources** - Your child has their own income or assets
5. **Property settlement impact** - Your property settlement affects your capacity to pay
6. **High childcare costs** - Your childcare expenses are substantially higher than average
7. **Reduced capacity due to commitments** - You support other dependants
8. **Income/property/resources (Reason 8A)** - The other parent has income or assets not reflected in their tax return
9. **Earning capacity (Reason 8B)** - The other parent deliberately earns less than they're capable of
10. **Other special circumstances (Reason 10)** - A catch-all for situations not covered by reasons 1-9

**Timeframe:** You can apply for a Change of Assessment at any time, but it generally only affects future payments (not past ones).

## Step-by-Step: How to Object to Child Support Assessment Decisions

Here's the process for lodging a formal objection or Change of Assessment application:

### Step 1: Gather Your Evidence

Before you start, collect all relevant documents:

- Your current child support assessment letter
- Income evidence (tax returns, payslips, financial statements)
- Care arrangement documentation (court orders, parenting plans, calendars)
- Receipts and invoices for expenses you're claiming
- Medical reports (if claiming special needs costs)
- Any correspondence with the other parent

The stronger your evidence, the better your chances of success.

### Step 2: Identify Your Grounds

For a Change of Assessment, you need to specify which of the 10 official reasons applies to your situation. You can select multiple reasons if more than one fits.

For an objection, you need to clearly identify what error was made and how it should be corrected.

### Step 3: Complete the Application

**For objections:**
- Call 131 272 or use myGov
- Clearly state the decision you're objecting to
- Explain the error that was made
- Provide your evidence

**For Change of Assessment:**
- Complete the Change of Assessment application form
- Provide detailed information about your circumstances
- Include all supporting documentation
- Submit online, by post, or in person

### Step 4: Await the Decision

Services Australia will review your application and may contact you or the other parent for more information.

For objections, you'll usually receive a decision within 60 days.

For Change of Assessment applications, the process typically takes 8-12 weeks, though complex cases may take longer.

### Step 5: Respond to the Outcome

If your objection or COA is successful, your assessment will be adjusted. The new amount will usually apply from a specific date (often the date of your application).

If unsuccessful, you have further options:

- **SSAT Review** - Apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for an independent review
- **Court Application** - Apply to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia
- **New Application** - If circumstances change, you can apply again

## Common Mistakes When Objecting to Child Support

Avoid these errors that can weaken your case:

### 1. Missing the 28-Day Deadline

For objections, the deadline is strict. Mark it in your calendar the day you receive any decision you disagree with.

### 2. Not Providing Enough Evidence

"I think they're hiding income" isn't enough. You need bank statements, lifestyle evidence, business records, or other documentation to support your claims.

### 3. Choosing the Wrong Process

An objection is for errors; a Change of Assessment is for circumstances. Using the wrong pathway wastes time and may result in rejection.

### 4. Being Vague About Your Circumstances

Be specific. Instead of "I have high costs," detail exactly what you spend, when, and why it's necessary for your child's wellbeing.

### 5. Letting Emotions Drive Your Application

Focus on facts and evidence, not how unfair you feel the situation is. Decision-makers respond to documentation, not frustration.

## When to Get Professional Help

While many parents successfully **object to child support assessments** on their own, some situations benefit from professional assistance:

- **Complex financial situations** - Business owners, trust structures, or multiple income sources
- **High-conflict co-parenting** - When communication has broken down
- **Significant amounts at stake** - When the assessment difference is substantial
- **Previous unsuccessful attempts** - When you've tried and failed before
- **Court proceedings** - When matters need to go beyond Services Australia

A family lawyer specialising in child support can help you:

- Identify the strongest grounds for your case
- Gather and present evidence effectively
- Navigate the appeals process if needed
- Represent you in tribunal or court proceedings

## Key Takeaways

To successfully **object to child support assessment** decisions in Australia:

1. **Act quickly** - Meet the 28-day deadline for objections
2. **Choose the right pathway** - Objection for errors, Change of Assessment for circumstances
3. **Gather strong evidence** - Documentation is everything
4. **Be specific** - Clearly explain your situation and which grounds apply
5. **Know your options** - Appeals tribunals and courts are available if needed
