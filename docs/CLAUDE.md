**⚠️ NEVER commit `.env` to git** - It contains secrets and is in `.gitignore`

**Note for new developers:** If `.env` is missing, contact the project owner for credentials.

### 🗂️ .gitignore Structure

The project uses a comprehensive `.gitignore` to protect sensitive business data:

**Business Data (NOT tracked):**
- `/business-docs/` - Lawyer partnerships, invoices, signed agreements
- `/data/` - Email lists, outreach data, analytics exports
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.cert` - Security certificates
- `secrets/`, `config/secrets.json` - API keys and credentials

**Build Artifacts (NOT tracked):**
- `dist/`, `build/`, `out/` - Generated web builds
- `/ios`, `/android` - Generated native folders (use `npx expo prebuild` to regenerate)
- `*.map` - Source maps
- `.expo/`, `.expo-shared/`, `.expo-internal/` - Expo cache

**Development Files (NOT tracked):**
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- `.env*` - Environment variables
- `*.log` - Log files
- `.DS_Store` - macOS metadata

**Documentation (TRACKED in git):**
- `docs/` - All documentation files are version controlled for team collaboration

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**🎯 BUSINESS MODEL:** This is a **B2B lead generation** app, not a B2C utility.

- Parents use FREE calculator
- Complexity triggers detect high-value cases (high income variance, special circumstances, court dates)
- "Get Legal Help" buttons connect parents with lawyers
- Lawyers pay $100 per booked consultation
- Target: $4K-$380K/year revenue
- **Full Model Justification:** See `docs/PRICING_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md` for comprehensive regulatory compliance analysis

This is an **Expo/React Native multi-platform app** (iOS, Android, Web) that implements an Australian Child Support Calculator with integrated lawyer lead generation.

### 📱 Platform Support

**Multi-platform (React Native):**

- ✅ **iOS** - Mobile app (App Store deployment pending)
- ✅ **Android** - Mobile app (Play Store deployment pending)
- ✅ **Web** - Static site export for `auschildsupport.com`

**Platform-specific considerations:**

- PostHog analytics: Mobile only (disabled on web)
- Haptic feedback: Mobile only
- Admin panel: Web-optimized (mobile compatible)

## 🔧 Key Technical Patterns

### Calculator Logic

The app implements the official Australian child support 8-step formula from Services Australia.

**Read the full explanation in `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**

**Key concepts:**

- **CSI (Child Support Income)**: ATI - SSA - relevant dependents
- **Income %**: Your share of combined income
- **Cost %**: Credit for care time (derived from care nights)
- **The Gap**: Income % - Cost % = Payment %

**Implementation:**

- `src/hooks/useCalculator.ts` - Form state and orchestration
- `src/utils/child-support-calculations.ts` - Core formulas
- `src/utils/child-support-constants.ts` - Government rates (year-indexed)
- `src/utils/cost-of-children-tables.ts` - Official cost tables

### Complexity Detection

Identifies high-value cases that need legal help:

- High income variance between parents
- Special circumstances (Change of Assessment reasons)
- Court dates or legal proceedings
- Zero payment anomalies

**Implementation:** `src/utils/complexity-detection.ts`

### Database Integration (Supabase)

Stores inquiry form submissions for admin review:

- **Client:** `src/utils/supabase.ts`
- **Table:** `leads` (id, name, email, phone, description, urgency, source, created_at)
- **RLS Policies:** Read/write access configured
- **Admin Panel:** `app/admin/*` routes

### Platform-Specific Code

Use `Platform.OS` checks for platform-specific features:

```typescript
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

// Analytics (mobile only)
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  PostHog.capture('event_name');
}

// Haptics (mobile only)
if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
  Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium);
}
```

### Styling System

All styling uses React Native StyleSheet with consistent color palette:

**Colors (from `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`):**

- Primary: `#2563eb` (blue-600)
- Background: `#0f172a` (slate-900)
- Cards: `#1e293b` (slate-800)
- Text: `#f8fafc` (slate-50)

**No Tailwind CSS** - Use StyleSheet.create() for all styles.

## 🤖 AI Assistant Guidance

### Recommended Models by Task Type

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Default) ✅

- Code implementation (components, utils, screens)
- Bug fixes and debugging
- Adding features to existing code
- Refactoring and optimization
- Documentation updates
- Most development tasks

**Claude Opus 4** (Strategic Use)

- Complex architectural decisions
- Multi-system integrations
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security audits
- Design judgment tasks (responsive web design)
- When stuck >2 hours on same problem

**Cost Reality:**

- Sonnet 4.5: ~$0.01-0.05 per prompt
- Opus 4: ~$0.10-0.50 per prompt (10x more)
- Most tasks work perfectly with Sonnet

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Code Quality:**
- ❌ Don't use `any` types - always define proper TypeScript interfaces
- ❌ Don't skip error handling - production code needs try/catch blocks
- ❌ Don't forget loading states - users need feedback
- ❌ Don't ignore edge cases - test with null, undefined, empty strings, extreme values

**Project-Specific:**
- ❌ Don't use Tailwind CSS - this project uses React Native StyleSheet
- ❌ Don't enable PostHog on web - it's mobile-only (Platform.OS !== 'web')
- ❌ Don't modify `/ios` or `/android` manually - they're generated by `expo prebuild`
- ❌ Don't use `react-native-web` specific APIs without Platform checks

**Security:**
- ❌ Don't commit `.env` files - they're gitignored for a reason
- ❌ Don't store business data in git - use `/business-docs/` and `/data/` (gitignored)
- ❌ Don't expose Supabase keys in client code - use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix only for public keys
- ❌ Don't hardcode admin credentials - always use environment variables

**Business Logic:**
- ❌ Don't modify calculation formulas without verifying against Services Australia documentation
- ❌ Don't change complexity triggers without understanding business impact (affects revenue)
- ❌ Don't alter lead submission flow without testing end-to-end

## 💡 Production Code Standards

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Apply to EVERY code generation task**

When asking Claude to write code, ALWAYS include:

```
PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Proper TypeScript types (no 'any')
- Error handling for all failure cases
- Loading states where needed
- Input validation and sanitization
- Edge case handling (empty strings, null, undefined, extreme values)
- Accessibility labels where appropriate

Before implementing, think:
1. What could go wrong? (error cases)
2. What am I forgetting? (loading states, validation, edge cases)
3. Is this production-ready or just a demo?
```

### Good vs Bad Prompts

**❌ Bad Prompt:**

```
Create a component that displays lead information
```

**✅ Good Prompt:**

```
Create src/components/LeadCard.tsx that displays lead information.

PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Props: lead (Lead type), onPress (callback)
- Handle missing/null fields gracefully
- Add loading state if data is fetching
- Validate email/phone format before display
- Add accessibility labels for screen readers
- Error boundary for render failures

Think about edge cases: What if lead has no phone? What if email is malformed?
```

**Why This Matters:** The difference between demo code and production code is in YOUR prompt. Claude builds exactly what you ask for - no more, no less.

## 🎯 When to Use Plan Mode (Claude Code)

### What is Plan Mode?

**Plan Mode** makes Claude Code create a detailed plan BEFORE executing. It costs ~10x more but is valuable for complex tasks.

**Visual Indicators:**

- **Regular Mode:** `? for shortcuts` (default)
- **Plan Mode:** `" plan mode on (shift+tab to cycle)`
- **Accept Edits:** `▶▶ accept edits on (shift+tab to cycle)` (different feature - auto-approves changes)

**Cycle through modes:** Press **Shift+Tab**

### ✅ Use Plan Mode For:

- Multi-file changes (3+ files)
- Complex features spanning multiple systems
- Architecture decisions
- When stuck after 2-3 attempts
- Major refactoring
- Integration work (database, API, auth)

### ❌ Use Regular Mode For:

- Single file edits
- Bug fixes
- Adding one feature
- Documentation updates
- Simple prompts (1-3 sentences)
- Copy-paste tasks

### Cost Comparison

- Phase 1-2 with smart Plan mode use: ~$2-5
- Same work using Plan mode everywhere: ~$15-30
- **Rule of thumb:** Use Plan mode for <10% of prompts

# Test with cache cleared
npx expo start --clear
```

**Verify:**

- Calculator produces correct results
- Complexity triggers fire appropriately
- Inquiry form saves to Supabase
- Admin panel loads and displays leads
- All navigation works smoothly
- Styling looks correct on all platforms

### Production Testing
