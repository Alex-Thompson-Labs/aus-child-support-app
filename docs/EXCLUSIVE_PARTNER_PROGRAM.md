# Exclusive Partner Program

## 🎯 Program Overview

The **Exclusive Partner Program** is the core B2B validation strategy for Phase 3A. It shifts the business model from a transactional per-lead fee to a high-value **Marketing Retainer** relationship with select Family Law firms.

**Core Value Prop:** "Powered by [Firm Name]" Co-Branded Calculator.

## 💼 The Offer

We are pitching a partnership model rather than a simple software subscription.

### 1. The Marketing Retainer

- **Investment:** ~$500/month (allocated to Ad Spend).
- **Commitment:** Month-to-month during validation.
- **ROI Goal:** 15%+ Consultation Rate from generated leads.

### 2. Co-Branded Assets

- Partners receive a dedicated version of the calculator.
- **Branding:** "Powered by [Partner Firm]" logo placement.
- **Custom Funnel:** Leads generated via this specific link are routed exclusively to the partner.

### 3. Lead Exclusivity
