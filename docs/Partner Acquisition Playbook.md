Below is a **full replacement partner acquisition playbook** that treats the audit as binding and explicitly corrects every material flaw identified.

This is written to survive a skeptical managing partner, not to “sound good”.

=======================================

**Partner Acquisition Playbook (Revised, Defensible, Testable)**
----------------------------------------------------------------

**Status:** Pilot-ready

**Audience:** Founder executing direct firm outreach

**Scope:** Partner acquisition only

**1\. Executive Summary**
-------------------------

### **Revised Strategy Overview**

This playbook replaces the original “partner funds ads + per-lead fee” model with **two clean, defensible partnership paths** that eliminate financial misalignment, asset leakage, and trust conflicts:

1.  *   Partner funds ad spend.
        
    *   Calculator is deployed on a **partner-controlled subdomain**.
        
    *   You charge a **flat monthly management fee**, no per-lead pricing.
        
    *   Partner owns traffic, leads, and brand equity.
        
2.  *   You fund ad spend.
        
    *   You sell **exclusive, qualified leads** at a market-realistic CPL.
        
    *   Partner bears no acquisition risk.
        

Both models:

*   Remove deceptive CPL math.
    
*   Eliminate traffic ownership conflicts.
    
*   Reduce operational friction.
    
*   Are legally and commercially legible to law firms.
    

### **What Changed vs Original Model**

*   Per-lead pricing + partner-funded ads removed.
    
*   White-label deployment is default, not optional.
    
*   Exclusivity is limited, conditional, and earned.
    
*   Complexity scoring is binary and auditable.
    
*   CRM-friendly delivery replaces “magic links”.
    
*   Assumptions are explicitly bounded and test-gated.
    

**2\. Design Principles (Derived from Critique)**
-------------------------------------------------

1.  *   A partner never pays both acquisition cost and margin without control.
        
2.  *   Whoever funds traffic owns the traffic, pixel, and SEO value.
        
3.  *   Any partner can recompute ROI in 60 seconds without feeling misled.
        
4.  *   Leads arrive where intake already works, email or CRM, not dashboards.
        
5.  *   “Complexity” must map to concrete legal triggers, not abstract scores.
        
6.  *   Low volume, longer time horizon, clear kill criteria.
        

**3\. Revised Partnership Model**
---------------------------------

### **Model A: Agency Model (Recommended Default)**

#### **Who This Is For**

*   Tier-2 family law firms (5–20 lawyers).
    
*   Already spending on Google Ads.
    
*   Want better case mix, not more volume.
    

#### **Commercial Structure**

**Element**

**Terms**

Ad Spend

Paid directly by partner

Your Fee

Flat $1,000–$1,500 per month

Lead Ownership

Partner

Traffic Destination

calculator.partnerfirm.com.au

Exclusivity

Optional, time-boxed, local only

Contract Length

30-day pilot, rolling monthly

**Why this fixes the critique:**

*   No CPL misrepresentation.
    
*   Partner keeps all upside.
    
*   You are paid for expertise and infrastructure, not arbitrage.
    

#### **What You Provide**

*   Calculator engine and qualification logic.
    
*   Landing page hosted on partner subdomain (CNAME).
    
*   Google Ads campaign setup and optimisation.
    
*   Intake-ready lead delivery.
    
*   Weekly reporting and optimisation calls.
    

#### **What the Partner Provides**

*   Google Ads account and budget.
    
*   Intake response within 24 hours.
    
*   Feedback on lead quality.
    

### **Model B: Vendor Model (Selective Use)**

#### **Who This Is For**

*   Firms that refuse to fund ads.
    
*   Firms testing a new city or practice area.
    

#### **Commercial Structure**

**Element**

**Terms**

Ad Spend

You

Price

$250–$400 per qualified lead

Lead Ownership

Partner

Exclusivity

Per-lead, per-postcode

Risk

Yours

**Important:**

This model only works if **your internal CPA for complex cases stays below $200**. If not, it is abandoned.

**4\. Lead Qualification Logic (Rebuilt)**
------------------------------------------

### **Replace “Complexity Score” With Binary Triggers**

A lead is **qualified** only if at least one is true:

*   Declared income variance > $150,000.
    
*   Existing or pending court proceedings.
    
*   Change of Assessment factors selected.
    
*   International jurisdiction involved.
    
*   Self-employed or trust income declared.
    

**Explicit Rejection:**

*   Simple administrative assessments.
    
*   “Just checking an estimate”.
    
*   No dispute flags selected.
    

**Why:**

Partners trust rules they can read and argue with. Scores feel opaque and self-serving.

**5\. Revised Financial Model (Assumptions-Based)**
---------------------------------------------------

### **Agency Model Economics (Partner View)**

**Assumptions**

*   CPC: $40–70 \[Benchmark\]
    
*   Conversion to completed calculator: 40–55% \[Benchmark\]
    
*   Qualified trigger rate: 15–30% \[Unverified\]
    
*   Lead to consult: 10–20% \[Benchmark\]
    

**Monthly Example**

**Conservative**

**Moderate**

Ad Spend

$3,000

$4,000

Your Fee

$1,200

$1,200

Qualified Leads

6

10

Effective CPL

$700

$520

Cost per Consult

$3,500

$2,600

**Interpretation:**

This is **not cheap leads**.

It is **waste reduction**, better lawyer utilisation, and higher case value.

If a partner expects $100 CPL, they are not a fit.

### **Vendor Model Economics (Your View)**

**Metric**

**Threshold**

Max CPA (internal)

$200

Sale Price

$250–$400

Gross Margin

20–50%

Scale Condition

CPA stability over 60 days

If CPA breaches $200 for 30 days, pause or exit.

**6\. Revised Outreach & Pitch Strategy**
-----------------------------------------

### **Positioning Narrative (Honest)**

> “We do not sell cheap leads.

> We remove administrative child support work from your intake so your lawyers spend time on disputes, court work, and high-value cases.

> You either hire us to improve your existing ad spend, or you buy fully qualified matters with no risk. We do not mix the two.”

### **Example First Outreach (Managing Partner)**

Subject: Filtering child support work before it hits your intake

Hi \[Name\],

Most firms we speak to are paying Google for a lot of child support enquiries that never become files.

We’ve built a child support assessment engine that filters out administrative cases before intake, and routes only disputes and court-driven matters.

This is not a lead arbitrage play.

You either:

• run it on your own subdomain and keep all traffic and leads, or

• buy exclusive, pre-qualified matters with no ad spend.

We start with a 30-day pilot and clear kill criteria.

If you’re open to a short call, I can walk through the qualification rules and pilot structure.

Regards,

\[Name\]

### **Objection Handling Logic**

**“Why not put it on our site?”**

Correct. That is exactly what we do. Subdomain deployment is default.

**“What’s the real cost per case?”**

Unknown initially. Pilot is designed to measure consult rate and case value before scale.

**“Are you reselling our traffic?”**

No. In the agency model, you own the pixel, domain, and leads. Contractually.

**“Our team won’t use dashboards.”**

They don’t need to. Leads arrive by secure email or CRM webhook.

**7\. Execution Plan**
----------------------

### **Week 0: Readiness**

*   Binary qualification rules finalised.
    
*   Privacy policy updated to processor language.
    
*   Lead delivery tested via email and Zapier.
    

### **Week 1: Partner Outreach**

*   Target 8–10 Tier-2 firms.
    
*   Aim for 2–3 discovery calls.
    

### **Week 2: Pilot Setup**

*   Subdomain connected.
    
*   Ads live.
    
*   Intake flow tested.
    

### **Weeks 3–6: Pilot Run**

*   Weekly review.
    
*   No optimisation without partner sign-off.
    

### **Week 6: Decision**

*   Expand.
    
*   Adjust.
    
*   Or stop.
    

Founder executes all steps personally.

**8\. Residual Risks & Kill Criteria**
--------------------------------------

### **Risks That Remain**

*   High complexity does not equal ability to pay.
    
*   Seasonal volume swings.
    
*   Google policy enforcement variance.
    
*   Law firm intake inertia.
    

### **Kill Criteria (Non-Negotiable)**

**Condition**

**Action**

Internal CPA > $200 (Vendor)

Stop vendor model

<10% consult rate after 6 weeks

Re-scope or exit

Partner fails 24h response twice

Terminate pilot

Google blocks destination

Pause immediately

**9\. Validation Roadmap**
--------------------------

### **Data Required Before Scale**

*   CPA for binary-qualified cases.
    
*   Consult booking rate by trigger type.
    
*   Case value distribution.
    
*   Intake response impact on conversion.
    

### **How to Move From Assumption to Evidence**

1.  Run 2 pilots minimum.
    
2.  Do not aggregate markets.
    
3.  Publish internal post-mortems.
    
4.  Lock pricing only after 60 days of stable CPA.
    

**Final Reality Check**
-----------------------

This model:

*   Will close fewer partners than the original pitch.
    
*   Will survive scrutiny.
    
*   Can be piloted safely.
    
*   Does not rely on deceptive math or hidden assumptions.
    

If a firm says yes to this, they mean it.
