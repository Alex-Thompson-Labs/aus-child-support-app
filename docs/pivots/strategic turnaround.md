# Strategic Turnaround Plan: AusChildSupport B2B Outreach

**Objective:** Pivot from "hobbyist developer" to "professional lead generation partner" for Australian family law firms.
**Target:** Small to medium Family Law firms (1-10 lawyers) in Victoria/Australia.
**Current Status:** Cold outreach needs significant restructuring for credibility and conversion.

## Phase 1: Fix "Radioactive" Compliance
*Before sending another email, you must address the legal/privacy mechanics. If a lawyer suspects illegal data harvesting, they will block you.*

### 1. The "Explicit Consent" Checkbox
**Problem:** Sending user data to a lawyer without specific permission violates the Privacy Act.
**Fix:** Implement a mandatory checkbox in your React Native app flow before the "Get Legal Help" button activates.
* **Copy:** *"I consent to having my case details and contact information shared with a partner family law firm for the purpose of a preliminary assessment."*
* **Why:** This changes the product from "Data Breach Risk" to "GDPR/Privacy Act Compliant Warm Lead."

### 2. Referral Fee Disclosure
**Problem:** "Referral fees" carry a stigma and specific regulatory burdens in Victoria (Legal Profession Uniform Law).
**Fix:**
* **Reframe:** You are providing **Outsourced Intake & Marketing**, not "selling people."
* **Disclosure:** Your app terms must state: *"We may receive a marketing or referral fee from the law firm for making this introduction."*
* **Why:** Lawyers are generally permitted to pay referral fees *if disclosed to the client*. You must handle the disclosure so the lawyer doesn't have to worry about it.

## Phase 2: Pivot the Value Proposition
*A "complex case" is not enough. A complex case with no money is a pro bono case (lawyers avoid these). You must sell "Qualified Prospects."*

### 1. Add "The Wealth Filter"
Update the app to ask two qualifying questions before generating a lead:
1.  *"Does the other party own a business, trust, or hide income?"* (Implies complexity + assets).
2.  *"Is there a property settlement pending?"* (Where the high billable hours are).

### 2. The "No-Risk" Pilot
**Strategy:** Stop asking for a marriage proposal (contract) on the first date.
**New Offer:** "I will send you my next 3 qualified leads for free."
**Why:**
* Removes all friction.
* Proves lead quality before money changes hands.
* Easier for a lawyer to say "Yes" to a trial than a "Partnership."

## Phase 3: Professionalize Identity
*"Alex Thompson" needs to look like an agency, not a solo dev.*

1.  **Business Entity:** Use your ABN to register a business name (e.g., "AusSupport Analytics" or "Thompson Legal Marketing").
2.  **Professional Signature:**
    > **Alex Thompson**
    > Director of Partnerships | [Business Name]
    > *Specializing in Family Law Lead Qualification*

## Phase 4: The New Outreach Script
*Use this draft to minimize friction and highlight value.*

**Subject:** Intake overflow: 3 pre-vetted family law leads ([City/Region])

**Body:**

Hi [Lawyer Name],

I run **AusChildSupport**, a digital platform that helps parents calculate complex assessments.

We are currently generating inquiries from parents in [Suburb/Region] involving **business income disputes** and **high-conflict care arrangements**. These aren't just "calculator users"—we filter them for intent and financial complexity.

I’m looking for a local firm to handle these specific referrals.

Rather than asking you to sign anything upfront, **I’d like to send you our next 3 qualified case summaries for free.**

If they turn into billable matters, we can chat about a regular flow. If they don't meet your standards, no hard feelings.

Are you open to reviewing a sample case summary?

Regards,

**Alex Thompson**
Director | [Business Name]

## Phase 5: The "Lead Sheet" (Next Step)
*When they say "Yes," you need a standardized PDF/Email format to send them.*

**Requirements for the Lead Sheet:**
* **Anonymized Header:** (e.g., "Case #492 - Glen Waverley")
* **Financial Snapshot:** Income disparity, Asset pool estimation.
* **Complexity Indicators:** "Director of Company," "Interstate relocation," "Binding Child Support Agreement required."
* **The Hook:** A user quote describing their pain point.
