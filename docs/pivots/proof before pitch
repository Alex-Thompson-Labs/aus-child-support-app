# 6-8 Week Validation Plan: Proof Before Pitch

## Week 1-2: Generate Initial Traffic (Zero Budget)

### Exact Actions

**Content Creation (6-8 hours total):**
1. Write 3 targeted blog posts on auschildsupport.com:
   - "Child Support Calculator Australia: Estimate Your Payments in 60 Seconds"
   - "8 Situations Where Child Support Gets Complicated (And You Need Legal Help)"
   - "Child Support Formula Explained: Income, Care %, and Special Circumstances"

2. Answer 10-15 existing questions on these platforms:
   - Reddit: r/AusLegal, r/AusFinance (search "child support")
   - Whirlpool Forums: Relationships & Family Law section
   - Facebook: Join 3-5 Australian single parent groups

**Distribution Strategy (4-6 hours):**
1. Post calculator link on Reddit r/AusLegal as: "I built a free child support calculator - does this match your Services Australia estimate?" (Not promotional, genuinely asking for validation)
2. Answer Whirlpool threads from past 30 days mentioning child support calculations with: "I built a calculator that matches Services Australia's formula - happy to help you estimate"
3. In Facebook groups: Respond helpfully to posts asking about child support with calculator mention in comments (not standalone posts)

**SEO Quick Wins (2-3 hours):**
1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
2. Add Schema markup for Calculator (SoftwareApplication)
3. Create Google Business Profile for "Australian Child Support Calculator"
4. Get listed on Australian legal resource directories (free listings):
   - Lawpath resources section
   - LawAccess NSW community resources
   - Family Relationships Online

### Success Metrics
- 50-100 calculator sessions
- 5-10 inquiry form completions
- 2-3 Reddit/forum upvotes or responses validating calculator accuracy

### Failure Signals
- Zero traffic after 2 weeks = content isn't reaching audience
- Traffic but zero form completions = form is broken or trust issue
- Form completions but all junk (obvious spam) = need better filtering

### Time Investment
12-15 hours total over 2 weeks

## Week 3-4: Capture Quality Leads + Find Validation Lawyers

### Lead Capture Refinement

**Update inquiry form to extract lawyer-ready intel (2 hours):**

Required fields:
1. "Briefly describe your situation" (free text, 100+ chars required)
2. "What makes your case complicated?" (checkboxes):
   - Shared care arrangements changing
   - Self-employed or variable income
   - Multiple children with different partners
   - Disagreement about income figures
   - International elements (parent lives overseas)
   - Child has special needs affecting costs
   - Other (specify)
3. "Your combined annual income (approximate)" (bands: <$50k, $50-100k, $100-150k, $150k+)
4. "Preferred contact method" (phone/email)
5. "How urgent is this?" (Immediate, Within 2 weeks, Just exploring options)
6. "Location" (Suburb, State - critical for lawyer matching)

**Quality filter logic:**
- Auto-flag as "high quality" if:
  - Income >$100k (can afford lawyer)
  - Selected 2+ complexity factors
  - Urgency = Immediate or Within 2 weeks
  - Free text >150 characters (genuine detail)

### Finding Validation Lawyers (8-10 hours)

**Target: 2-3 lawyers willing to receive free leads for feedback only**

**Where to find them:**
1. LinkedIn: Search "family lawyer solo practitioner [NSW/VIC/QLD]"
   - Look for lawyers with <5 years experience (hungrier, more open to new sources)
   - Filter for those who post content (shows they're active, growth-minded)

2. Law Society directories: Find lawyers with small practices (1-3 lawyers)

3. Google Maps: Search "family lawyer [suburb]" in mid-tier suburbs (not premium CBDs where they're flooded with leads)

**The Pitch (email, not LinkedIn DM):**

Subject: Quick feedback on child support lead quality?

Hi [Name],

I've built a child support calculator that's starting to generate parent inquiries in [State]. Before I scale this, I need to understand what actually makes a lead valuable to practitioners.

Would you be willing to receive 3-5 inquiries over the next few weeks (completely free) and give me honest feedback on whether they're worth your time? I'm specifically trying to learn:
- What information you need to evaluate a case quickly
- What distinguishes a serious inquiry from a tire-kicker
- Whether these convert to consultations

No strings attached - I'm in pure learning mode and happy to send referrals elsewhere if the quality isn't there.

Interested in helping? Happy to jump on a 10-min call to explain more.

Sam

**Why this works:**
- Framed as you seeking education, not selling
- Lawyer gets free leads with zero commitment
- Asks for their expertise (flattering)
- Time-limited (3-5 leads, not ongoing)

**Send to 15-20 lawyers, expect 2-4 responses, need 2-3 to commit**

### Success Metrics
- 15-20 inquiry form completions (from Week 1-4 traffic combined)
- 8-12 flagged as "high quality" by your filter
- 2-3 lawyers agree to receive free leads for feedback

### Failure Signals
- <10 inquiries total = traffic strategy failing, need paid ads
- >20 inquiries but <5 high quality = filter too strict or wrong audience
- Zero lawyers respond to pitch = email too salesy or wrong target

### Time Investment
10-12 hours total

## Week 5-6: Place Leads + Track Conversion

### Lead Distribution

**Process (ongoing, ~2 hours/week):**
1. Each high-quality lead comes in → manually review
2. Send to validation lawyer within 24 hours via email:

Template:

Hi [Lawyer],

New referral from the child support calculator:

**Contact:** [Name], [Phone], [Email]
**Location:** [Suburb, State]
**Income Bracket:** [Band]
**Complexity Factors:** [List checked boxes]
**Situation:** "[Their free text description]"
**Urgency:** [Their selection]

**Why flagged as complex:** [Your 1-sentence assessment]

Let me know if this converts to a consultation - I'm tracking quality to improve the referral criteria.

Thanks,
Sam

3. Track in spreadsheet:
   - Date sent
   - Lawyer name
   - Lead details
   - Lawyer feedback received (Y/N)
   - Consultation booked (Y/N)
   - Client retained (Y/N)

### Conversion Tracking System

**Set up 3 follow-up touchpoints per lead:**

1. **Day 3:** "Did you have a chance to contact [Lead Name]? Any initial feedback on quality?"

2. **Day 10:** "Following up on [Lead Name] - did this convert to a consultation? If not, what was the issue? (They didn't respond, wrong type of case, couldn't afford, etc.)"

3. **Day 30:** "Final check on [Lead Name] - if they did consult, did they retain you? Trying to understand full conversion funnel."

**Critical questions to ask lawyers:**

After they've received 3-5 leads, schedule 15-min call:
1. "Of the [X] leads I sent, how many were actually worth your time to contact?"
2. "What separated the good ones from the bad ones?"
3. "What information was missing that you needed to qualify them?"
4. "If you were paying for these, what would make them worth $50 each?"
5. "What conversion rate (leads→retained clients) would you need to justify buying leads?"
6. "Would you pay for more leads like [specific good example]? Why/why not?"

### Success Metrics
- 10+ leads sent to validation lawyers
- 2-3 lawyers provide detailed feedback
- At least 20% of leads convert to consultations (2+ consultations from 10 leads)
- At least 1 consultation converts to retained client

### Failure Signals
- <5% consultation rate = leads are garbage, filter is broken
- Lawyers stop responding = you're sending junk and damaging relationship
- Lawyers say "these are fine but I wouldn't pay" = pricing model broken

### Time Investment
6-8 hours total (mostly email follow-ups)

## Week 7-8: Document Results + Build Proof Package

### Data Analysis (3-4 hours)

**Calculate these metrics:**
1. Lead→Consultation rate: [X] consultations ÷ [Y] leads sent = Z%
2. Consultation→Retained rate: [X] retained ÷ [Y] consultations = Z%
3. Lead→Retained rate: [X] retained ÷ [Y] leads sent = Z%
4. Average time to contact lead (from lawyer feedback)
5. Most common complexity factors in converted leads
6. Income correlation (do higher income leads convert better?)

**Identify patterns:**
- Which types of cases converted best?
- What information was most valuable to lawyers?
- What red flags predict non-conversion?

### Build Proof Package (4-5 hours)

**Create one-page case study PDF:**

**Title:** "Child Support Calculator Lead Quality Report: 6-Week Trial Results"

**Contents:**
- Number of leads generated organically
- Number sent to family lawyers for evaluation
- Conversion metrics (lead→consult→retained rates)
- Sample lead profile (anonymized) with lawyer outcome
- Direct lawyer quotes: "[Lawyer Name], [Firm], [City]: 'The leads were well-qualified. I booked 2 consultations from 4 referrals, and retained 1 client worth $3,500 in fees.'"
- Cost comparison: "At 20% conversion, a $50 lead costs $250 per consultation. If 50% of consultations retain at $3,000 average, ROI = $500 per retained client."

**Get testimonial quotes from validation lawyers:**

Email: "Thanks for being part of the trial. Would you be comfortable with me using a quote from you when I approach other lawyers? Something like: '[Your feedback about lead quality]' - [Your Name], [Firm]"

Aim for 1-2 solid testimonials.

### Refine Lead Quality Criteria (2-3 hours)

Based on what actually converted:
1. Update form fields to capture what mattered
2. Revise auto-flagging algorithm to match conversion patterns
3. Document "ideal lead profile" for future filtering

### Create Lawyer Pitch Deck (3-4 hours)

**Slide 1:** Problem - "Solo practitioners waste time on unqualified family law inquiries"

**Slide 2:** Solution - "Pre-qualified child support leads from parents actively seeking legal help"

**Slide 3:** How it works - "Free calculator→complexity detection→qualified parent inquiries→sent to you within 24 hours"

**Slide 4:** Trial results - "[Metrics from your validation]"

**Slide 5:** Testimonials - "[Lawyer quotes]"

**Slide 6:** Pricing - "$50 per lead, no setup fees, cancel anytime"

**Slide 7:** Guarantee - "If first 3 leads don't generate at least 1 consultation, I'll refund 100% and send 3 more free"

### Success Metrics
- 15%+ lead→consultation rate (industry standard is 10-25%)
- 40%+ consultation→retained rate (proves lead quality)
- 2 lawyer testimonials willing to go on record
- Clear understanding of what makes a lead "qualified"

### Failure Signals
- <10% consultation rate = model doesn't work, leads are too cold
- No lawyers willing to provide testimonial = they didn't find value
- Wide variance in conversion between lawyers = quality is inconsistent

### Time Investment
12-15 hours total

## Traffic Reality Check: What's Achievable in 6 Weeks?

**Realistic organic traffic (zero budget):**
- Week 1-2: 30-80 sessions
- Week 3-4: 80-150 sessions (Reddit/forum posts gaining traction)
- Week 5-6: 100-200 sessions (SEO starting to kick in, word of mouth)
- Week 7-8: 150-250 sessions

**Total 6-week traffic: 500-800 sessions**

**Conversion to inquiry form: 2-4%**
- Low end: 500 × 2% = 10 inquiries
- High end: 800 × 4% = 32 inquiries

**Quality filter pass rate: 40-60%**
- Low end: 10 × 40% = 4 qualified leads
- High end: 32 × 60% = 19 qualified leads

**Realistic outcome: 8-15 qualified leads to send lawyers**

This is enough to validate if you get 2-3 lawyers on board. Each receives 3-5 leads. If conversion is good, you have proof.

---

## When to Spend the $1000-1500 Budget

**DO NOT spend on Google Ads yet.**

If validation fails (lawyers say leads don't convert), the money is wasted.

**Spend budget only if:**
1. Week 6 results show 15%+ consultation rate
2. You have 1-2 lawyer testimonials
3. You've identified clear "qualified lead" criteria
4. You need more volume to pitch additional lawyers

**Then allocate:**
- $800-1000: Google Ads targeting "child support calculator Australia"
- $200-300: Freelance writer for 3-5 SEO blog posts
- $100-200: Paid listings on legal directories

---

## Viability Thresholds

**Minimum conversion rates to justify business:**

**Lawyer's math:**
- Pays $50 per lead
- Needs 1 retained client per 5 leads to break even (assuming $3,000 avg case value, 50% profit margin)
- Therefore: 20% lead→retained rate required

**Your math:**
- Lead→consultation: 15% minimum (industry standard)
- Consultation→retained: 50% minimum (typical for family law)
- Combined: 15% × 50% = 7.5% lead→retained rate

**This doesn't work.** Lawyer needs 20%, you're delivering 7.5%.

**To hit viability:**
- Need 40% lead→consultation rate (very high, requires excellent filtering)
- Or 50% consultation→retained rate (depends on lawyer skill)
- Or lower pricing to $25-30 per lead

**Be prepared to discover:**
- $50/lead is too expensive for the conversion rate you achieve
- You need to charge $25-35 to make economics work
- Or you need to take on lawyer qualification risk (only charge for consultations booked, not leads sent)

---

## Pivot Triggers

**If by Week 4:**
- <5 qualified leads captured → Paid ads required, organic won't scale
- Zero validation lawyers found → Pitch needs refinement or wrong target audience
- Lawyers ghost after receiving first lead → Quality is worse than you think

**If by Week 6:**
- <10% consultation rate → Lead quality filter is broken
- Lawyers say "wouldn't pay for these" → Business model doesn't work
- High consultation rate but zero retentions → Leads are borderline cases lawyers can't help

**If by Week 8:**
- Can't get 2 testimonials → No proof to pitch other lawyers
- Conversion data shows unprofitable unit economics → Need to rethink pricing or model
- Lawyers want to pay per consultation, not per lead → Different business model required

---

## What Success Looks Like

**End of Week 8, you have:**
1. 8-15 leads sent to 2-3 lawyers
2. 15-25% consultation rate (2-4 consultations booked)
3. 1-2 retained clients across all lawyers
4. 2 lawyer testimonials confirming lead quality
5. Clear documentation of what makes a lead "qualified"
6. One-page case study showing conversion metrics
7. Understanding of whether $50/lead is viable or needs adjustment

**This is enough proof to:**
- Approach 10-15 new lawyers with credible data
- Confidently spend $1000 on Google Ads to scale lead volume
- Negotiate pricing based on actual conversion rates
- Avoid wasting time on a model that doesn't convert

**This plan prioritizes learning over revenue.** You make $0 in these 8 weeks. But you gain certainty about whether this business works before investing serious money.
