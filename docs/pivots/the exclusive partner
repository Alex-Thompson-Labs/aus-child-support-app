# Strategic Pivot: The "Exclusive Partner" Pilot Program
**Project:** Australian Child Support Calculator Lead Gen
**Owner:** Alex Thompson (Developer / Founder)
**Date:** January 2026

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**The Shift:** Moving from a "Lead Vendor" model (high risk, buying ads upfront) to a "Tech Partner" model (low risk, client funds ads).
**The Goal:** Secure **one** mid-sized family law firm to fund a 4-week exclusive pilot.
**The Value Prop:** The partner gets exclusive rights to a proprietary pre-qualification tool (the calculator) and branded lead generation without paying agency retainer fees.

## 2. The Deal Structure
Instead of selling leads for $50, we propose a "Managed Pilot."

* **Ad Budget:** Paid directly by the Law Firm (suggested $500 cap).
* **Management Fee:** $0 for the first month (Waived).
* **Tech Cost:** $0 (Waived).
* **Exclusivity:** The firm is the *sole* recipient of leads during the pilot.
* **Transparency:** The firm owns the Ad account or has read-access; they see exactly where every dollar goes.

**Why this works:**
1.  **Eliminates "Scam" Risk:** You never touch their ad money.
2.  **Eliminates Cash Risk:** You don't spend your own $1,000.
3.  **Builds Trust:** You are investing time/tech; they are investing ad spend.

## 3. Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Prospecting (Week 1)
**Target Profile:**
* **Location:** Melbourne (or your local capital city).
* **Size:** 3-10 Partners (Too small = no budget; Too big = too much bureaucracy).
* **Current Marketing:** They are already running Google Ads (search for "family lawyer Melbourne"). This proves they believe in ads but might want better ROI.

**The Outreach Strategy:**
Send 10 hyper-targeted emails/InMails. Do not spray and pray.

**The Script:**
> **Subject:** Partnership inquiry: Pre-qualifying child support leads for [Firm Name]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm a local developer who has built a specialized "Child Support Complexity Calculator." It filters out simple administrative cases and identifies parents with complex asset/custody disputes who actually need legal representation.
>
> I am looking for **one** Melbourne partner to pilot this tool with.
>
> **The Proposal:** I will rebrand the calculator as *"Powered by [Firm Name]"* and manage a Google Ads campaign for you at no cost. You simply cover the direct ad spend (capped at $500). All qualified inquiries go exclusively to your inbox.
>
> I'm not an agency selling leads. I'm a developer looking to test my technology with a reputable firm.
>
> Open to a 10-minute chat to see the demo?
>
> Best,
> Alex Thompson

### Phase 2: The Setup (Week 2)
Once a partner agrees:
1.  **Co-Branding:** Update `auschildsupport.com` (or a subdomain) to feature the Law Firm's logo and color scheme.
    * *Headline change:* "Free Assessment provided by [Firm Name]."
2.  **Ad Account:**
    * Option A: Lawyer adds you to their existing Google Ads account.
    * Option B: You set up a new account, they enter their billing details.
3.  **Tracking:** Ensure the "Submit" button fires a conversion event in Google Ads.

### Phase 3: The Pilot (Weeks 3-6)
* **Budget:** $15 - $20 / day.
* **Review:** Friday Check-in call (15 mins).
    * *Agenda:* Review lead list. Which ones were good? Which were bad?
    * *Optimization:* If leads are "broke," add a question about "Combined Household Income" to the calculator to filter them out earlier.

## 4. Commercialization (Month 2+)
If the pilot generates clients for the lawyer:

**Option A: The Retainer**
* You continue managing the system.
* Fee: $1,000/month management fee + Ad Spend.

**Option B: The Asset Sale / License**
* The firm licenses the calculator for their own website.
* Fee: $200/month SaaS fee.

**Option C: The Hybrid (Performance)**
* You revert to the "Per Lead" model, but now you have data proving it works, and you charge $80/lead because they are pre-qualified.

---

## 5. Critical Success Factors
* **Speed:** The lawyer must agree to call leads within 4 hours. Make this a condition of the pilot.
* **Geography:** Keep ads tight to the lawyer's catchment area (e.g., 20km radius). Don't waste money on leads 3 hours away.
* **Filtering:** The calculator is your "Unique Selling Proposition." It **must** ask hard questions (income, asset values, domestic violence flags) to prove you aren't just sending them tyre-kickers.
