## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

1. **Parent uses calculator** → Free, instant calculation (auschildsupport.com)
2. **Complex case detected** → Alert shown ("High Value", "Court Date Urgent", "Change of Assessment")
3. **Parent clicks "Get Legal Help"** → Fills inquiry form (consent checkbox, case details)
4. **Lead saved to database** → Supabase (encrypted, Privacy Act compliant)
5. **Admin reviews** → 30-second quality check in admin dashboard
6. **Teaser email to lawyer** → Case summary (no parent contact details)
7. **Lawyer accepts** → Charged $50 via Stripe
8. **Full details sent** → **Secure Magic Link** (Time-limited access, no PII in email)

## ⚠️ KEY RISKS & MITIGATIONS

| Risk                                      | Mitigation                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validation fails (<10% consultation rate) | ✅ Validation-first approach - test with free leads before asking lawyers to pay                                |
| No Exclusive Partner interest             | Continue validation path with free leads, use organic leads for proof                                           |
| Lawyers won't pay $50/lead                | Use proof package from Phase 3A, adjust price based on validation data ($25-35 if needed)                       |
| Lead quality too low                      | Manual review before sending, tighten complexity thresholds, validate with free leads first                     |
| Not enough traffic                        | Organic traffic generation, Exclusive Partner ads (if signed), conditional paid ads only if validation succeeds |
| Privacy Act compliance                    | ✅ RESOLVED - Database with proper consent, privacy policy, audit trails, deletion capability                   |
