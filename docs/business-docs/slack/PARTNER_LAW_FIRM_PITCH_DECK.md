## Slide 2: The Problem You're Facing

**Headline:** You're Paying for Clicks from "Tire Kickers"

**The Current Reality:**

- **Google Ads:** $100-300 per click, but most clicks don't convert
- **Unqualified Leads:** Parents just browsing, not serious about hiring a lawyer
- **Time Waste:** Cold calls that go nowhere, no-shows at consultations
- **Unclear ROI:** Hard to know if marketing spend is working
- **Technical Complexity:** Managing ad accounts, pixel tracking, optimization

**The Cost:**

- **Example:** 100 clicks at $200/click = $20,000
- **Result:** Maybe 5-10 consultations, 2-3 retained clients
- **Real Cost Per Client:** $6,000-10,000

**The Question:** "What if you only paid for leads that were already pre-qualified?"

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Headline:** Pre-Qualified Leads Where Complexity is Already Identified

**What We Do:**

1. **Free Calculator:** Parents use our calculator (auschildsupport.com)
2. **Complexity Detection:** System automatically identifies complex cases
   - Court dates (urgent)
   - Change of Assessment scenarios (hidden income, self-employed)
   - High-value cases (>$15k annual)
   - Shared care disputes
3. **Lead Qualification:** Parents submit inquiry (with consent)
4. **Quality Review:** We manually review each lead (30 seconds)
5. **Lead Delivery:** You get pre-qualified leads via secure portal

**The Difference:**

- **Not cold clicks** - Parents have already spent 10 minutes calculating
- **Not generic leads** - Complexity already identified
- **Not expensive** - $50 per lead vs $100-300 per click

---

## Slide 10: ROI Comparison

**Traditional Google Ads:**

| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Cost Per Click**                | $100-300      |
| **Click-to-Consultation Rate**    | 2-5%          |
| **Cost Per Consultation**         | $2,000-15,000 |
| **Consultation-to-Retained Rate** | 30-50%        |
| **Cost Per Retained Client**      | $4,000-30,000 |

**Our Pre-Qualified Leads:**

| Metric                            | Value         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Cost Per Lead**                 | $50           |
| **Lead-to-Consultation Rate**     | 15%+ (target) |
| **Cost Per Consultation**         | $333          |
| **Consultation-to-Retained Rate** | 30-50% (same) |
| **Cost Per Retained Client**      | $667-1,000    |

**Savings:** 75-90% reduction in cost per retained client
