# Exclusive Partner Outreach Plan: Sage Family Lawyers

**Status:** High Priority Target
**Context:** Sage is currently running ~38 active Google Ads, making them the most aggressive "Challenger" firm in the market. They are the ideal candidate for the "Marketing Retainer" model.

---

## 1. Target Intelligence

- **Firm Name:** Sage Family Lawyers
- **Size:** ~7 Lawyers (Perfect "Goldilocks" size: big budget, small bureaucracy).
- **Location:** Melbourne CBD (Level 4/533 Little Lonsdale St).
- **Why Them?**
  - **38 Active Ads:** They are already spending significant money on Google Ads. They understand CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) and are likely looking for ways to lower it.
  - **Challenger Profile:** They are competing against the "Big End of Town" and are likely hungrier for an edge than the established giants.

_Do not email the general admin address._

- **Primary Target:** **Paul Ross** (Principal)
  - _Email Pattern:_ Likely `pross@sagefamilylawyers.com.au`

## 4. Execution Strategy

### Step 1: The "Sniper" Pitch Email

_Send this Tuesday morning (approx 10:00 AM)._

**Subject:** Exclusive pilot: Pre-qualified child support leads for Sage Family Lawyers

> Hi Paul,
>
> I noticed Sage is running about 38 active ads on Google right now—you're clearly the most active firm in the Melbourne market, so I'm reaching out to you first.
>
> I've built a new child support calculator (auschildsupport.com) that identifies complex cases (hidden income, self-employed payers) before they ever speak to a lawyer.
>
> I'm looking for **one** firm in Melbourne to pilot an exclusive partnership.
>
> **The Deal:**
>
> - **$500 Marketing Retainer:** You fund the pilot budget.
> - **I manage the campaign:** I run the ads in my optimized account targeting your region.
> - **I rebrand the calculator** as _"Powered by Sage Family Lawyers."_
> - **All qualified leads** go exclusively to you via a secure portal for 4 weeks.
>
> **Why this works for Sage:**
>
> - **Lower CPA:** These aren't cold clicks; they are parents who have already spent 10 minutes calculating their liability.
> - **Exclusivity:** Your competitors (Clancy, Coote, etc.) won't see these leads.
> - **Zero Dev Cost:** You get a custom pre-qualification tool without building it.
>
> Are you open to a 10-min demo to see the complexity filter in action?
>
> Thanks,
> Sam

### Step 3: The Demo Call Script (15 Mins)

_Goal: Get them to say "Yes" to the $500 retainer._

1.  **The Hook:** "I saw your ads and realized you're paying for clicks from 'tire kickers'. My tool filters them out."
2.  **The Demo:** Share screen. Show the "Change of Assessment" reasons.
3.  **The Control:** "You pay a simple $500 retainer. I handle the ad account, pixel tracking, and optimization. You just get the qualified leads."
4.  **The Close:** "If we turn this on for 4 weeks and you get 5 qualified consults, would you consider that a win?"
