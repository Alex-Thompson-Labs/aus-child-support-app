## The "Sniper" Email Script

**Subject:** Filtering your Google Ads traffic (Child Support)

> Hi Paul,
>
> I’ve noticed Sage is one of the few firms in Melbourne aggressively bidding on "child support" keywords right now.
>
> **The problem with those keywords:** You are likely paying ~$15/click for parents who just want the free DHS calculator or a shoulder to cry on. They clog up your intake team and rarely have the budget for a retainer.
>
> **The solution:** I built an independent calculator (AusChildSupport.com) that filters these users _before_ they contact a lawyer. It uses the "Change of Assessment" logic to flag high-value complexity triggers, specifically:
>
> - Reason 8A (Hidden income/wealth/trust distributions)
> - Reason 8B (Earning capacity - deliberately underemployed)
>
> I am looking for **one** Melbourne firm to pilot a "Sponsored Results" placement for these specific high-value cases.
>
> **The Pilot:**
> I am not asking for a management fee. You simply pay a **$500 Marketing Retainer** (100% goes to ad spend), and I manage the campaign targeting your region. You get every qualified lead generated during the 4-week pilot.
>
> Are you open to a 10-minute screen share to see how the complexity filter works?
>
> Best,
>
> Sam
> Founder, AusChildSupport.com

## Strategic Notes

### Why this specific script?

1.  **Retainer vs. "You Run It":** Asking for a retainer is actually _less_ friction for them than asking them to set up a new campaign in their own account. It also keeps the **data pixel** in your control.
2.  **Jargon signalling:** Explicitly citing **"Reason 8A/8B"** proves you understand the law.
