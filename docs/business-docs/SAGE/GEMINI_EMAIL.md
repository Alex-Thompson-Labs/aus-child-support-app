## The "Sniper" Email Script

**Subject:** Filtering your Google Ads traffic (Child Support)

> Hi Paul,

> I’ve noticed Sage is one of the few firms in Melbourne aggressively bidding on "child support" keywords right now.
>
> **The problem with those keywords:** You are likely paying ~$15/click for parents who just want the free DHS calculator or a shoulder to cry on. They clog up your intake team and rarely have the budget for a retainer.
>
> **The solution:** I built an independent calculator (AusChildSupport.com) that filters these users _before_ they contact a lawyer. It uses the "Change of Assessment" logic to flag high-value complexity triggers, specifically:
>
> - Reason 8 (Hidden income/wealth)
> - Reason 9 (Self-employed/Trust discrepancies)
>
> I am looking for **one** Melbourne firm to pilot a "Sponsored Results" placement for these specific high-value cases.
>
> **The Pilot:**
> I am not asking for a fee. I simply suggest you divert a small test budget ($500) from your existing generic campaigns to this pre-qualified funnel. You own the data.
>
> Are you open to a 10-minute screen share to see how the complexity filter works?
>
> Best,
>

3.  **The "Reallocation" Frame:** You aren't asking for _new_ money. You are suggesting
