# CHECKLIST.md Updates - Production Code Prompting

## What Was Changed

Added critical guidance on how to prompt Claude for production-quality code throughout the Phase 1 CHECKLIST.md file.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Section at Top (after line 7)
**"💡 CRITICAL: How to Prompt Claude for Production Code"**

Explains:
- The problem: "create a component" → working demo, not production code
- The solution: Always ask for error handling, validation, edge cases
- Real examples of good vs bad prompts
- Evidence from actual testing showing what gets missed

### 2. Updated Task Prompts

**Task 1 (Analytics Wrapper):**
- Added: Error handling for missing API key, initialization failures, offline state
- Added: "Think about what could go wrong"

**Task 3 (LawyerAlert Component):**
- Added: Handle undefined props gracefully
- Added: Accessibility labels
- Added: Disable button during press

**Task 5d (Form Validation):**
- Completely rewritten with production requirements
- Added: Error state management, validation timing, specific rules
- Added: Edge cases (10k character paste, spam submit, whitespace names)

**Task 5f (Form Submission):**
- Completely rewritten with production requirements  
- Added: Loading states, error handling, data sanitization
- Added: Success feedback, navigation error handling

## Why This Matters

**Before these changes:**
```
"Create a form with name, email, phone fields"
→ Claude builds working UI with no validation
```

**After these changes:**
```
"Create a form with production-ready validation, error handling, loading states"
→ Claude builds complete system with error management
```

## The Core Insight

Claude doesn't automatically add "the good stuff" - it builds exactly what you ask for. If you ask for a component, you get a component. If you ask for a production-ready component with error handling and edge cases, you get that instead.

**The difference is in the prompt, not in Claude's capabilities.**

## How to Use This Going Forward

For EVERY code generation task:

1. **Read the prompt template in the guide**
2. **Don't skip the "CRITICAL" or "PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS" sections**
3. **Copy the full prompt including the edge case questions**
4. **Add your specific requirements on top**

Example:
```
[Copy from guide]
Create form validation with:
- Error state management
- Validation rules: ...
- Edge cases: ...

[Add your specifics]
Also add: Australian phone number format validation
```

## Files Changed

- `/Users/sammcdougal/d/csc/guides/phase1/CHECKLIST.md` - Added production prompting guidance throughout

## Next Steps

When working on remaining tasks:
1. Always read the updated prompts in the guide
2. Copy them fully, don't paraphrase
3. Add the "what could go wrong?" questions
4. Review Claude's output against the checklist

This should result in production-quality code from the first attempt, rather than needing multiple rounds of fixes.
