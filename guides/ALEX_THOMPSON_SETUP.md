## PHASE 5: LinkedIn Warm-Up Strategy (Dec 27-Jan 1)

### How LinkedIn Account Warming Works

**New accounts are limited:**
- Days 1-3: Send max 5 connection requests/day
- Days 4-7: Can increase to 10/day
- Days 8+: Can do 15-20/day safely

**Your schedule:**
- Dec 27: Send 5 requests
- Dec 28: Send 5 requests  
- Dec 29: Send 8 requests
- Dec 30: Send 10 requests
- Dec 31: Send 10 requests
- Jan 1: Send 10 requests
- Jan 2+: Send 15 requests/day

**Total by Jan 2:** 48 connection requests sent

### Connection Request Template

**Use this message (personalize the name):**
```
Hi [First Name],

I've built a child support calculator that generates leads for family lawyers. Would you be open to a quick conversation about how we might work together?

Best,
Alex
```

### Finding NSW Lawyers to Connect With

**Method 1 - LinkedIn Search:**
1. Go to LinkedIn search
2. Search: "family lawyer NSW"
3. Filter: People, Location: New South Wales
4. Send requests to lawyers (not paralegals/admins)

**Method 2 - Use Your CSV:**
1. Open family_law_contacts_full.csv
2. Filter for NSW lawyers with LinkedIn URLs
3. Visit their LinkedIn profiles
4. Send connection requests

### When Someone Accepts (1-2 days later)

**Send this follow-up message:**
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick context on what I'm building:

I send family lawyers pre-qualified leads when complex child support cases come through my calculator—things like high-value amounts, upcoming court dates, or change of assessment scenarios.

The model is straightforward: $50 per lead, sent via email with full case details (income, care split, complexity triggers, contact info). No software to install, no calendar integration needed.

I'm currently partnering with 3-5 family law firms across NSW and looking to add a few more.

Would this be relevant for your practice? Happy to send you an example of what a lead looks like.

Cheers,
Alex

## TRACKING SPREADSHEET

**Create Google Sheet: "LinkedIn Outreach Tracker"**

**Columns:**
```
Date | Name | Firm | LinkedIn URL | Request Sent | Accepted | Date Accepted | Message Sent | Response | Status | Notes
```

**Update daily:**
- Track every request sent
- Mark when accepted
- Track responses
- Note interest level

**Example row:**
```
Dec 27 | Sarah Chen | Chen Family Law | linkedin.com/... | Yes | Not yet | - | No | - | Pending | NSW, Sydney
```

---

## CRITICAL RULES

**DON'T:**
❌ Send more than 5-10 requests/day in first week (you'll get banned)
❌ Use automation tools (LinkedIn detects and bans)
❌ Copy-paste exact same message 100 times (looks like spam)
❌ Connect with everyone - be selective
❌ Be pushy in follow-ups

**DO:**
✅ Personalize each request slightly (use their first name)
✅ Track everything in spreadsheet
✅ Wait 1-2 days after acceptance before messaging
✅ Focus on NSW first (your test market)
✅ Be patient - this is a warm-up phase
✅ Respond quickly if someone messages you

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**By Jan 2, you should have:**
- ✅ LinkedIn profile complete and professional
- ✅ AI headshot uploaded
- ✅ 40-50 connection requests sent
- ✅ 15-25 connections accepted (50% acceptance rate)
- ✅ 10-15 follow-up messages sent
- ✅ 2-5 conversations started
- ✅ Business email working
- ✅ Virtual phone number active
- ✅ Tracking spreadsheet updated daily

**That sets you up for Jan 2 launch with:**
- Warm LinkedIn account (can send 15/day safely)
- Some early conversations already happening
- Professional business presence
- Working contact methods

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**"LinkedIn says I can't send more requests"**
→ You hit the daily limit. Wait 24 hours. Reduce volume tomorrow.

**"People aren't accepting my requests"**
→ Normal. 30-50% acceptance rate is good. Keep going.

**"Someone asked if I'm real"**
→ "Yes, I'm the founder. I keep my profile minimal for privacy but happy to chat on the phone if you'd like - [your number]"

**"AI headshot looks fake"**
→ Try different style or service. Or use Canva logo instead.

**"I don't have a domain yet"**
→ Use Gmail for now: alex.thompson.csc@gmail.com (less ideal but works)
