    Hi [First Name],
    
    I found [Firm Name] on the Family Law directory and wanted 
    to reach out about something I've built that might interest you.
    
    I've created a child support calculator that Australian parents 
    use to understand their obligations. When complex cases come 
    through (high value, court dates, disputes), I connect them with 
    local family lawyers like yourself.
    
    The model is simple: I send you pre-qualified leads via email, 
    you pay $50 per lead. No software to install, no appointments 
    to manage - just warm leads who need legal help.
    
    Would you be open to a quick call to discuss?
    
    Alex Thompson
    Founder
    Australian Child Support Calculator
    
    E: alex@childsupportcalc.com.au
    P: [Your phone]
    W: www.childsupportcalc.com.au
    ```
