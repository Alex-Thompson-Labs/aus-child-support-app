- AI headshot: $29 one-time
- Phone: $12 one-time
- **Total: $61**

**Your first month (conservative):**
- 3 lawyers × 10 leads each = 30 leads
- 30 leads × $50 = $1,500 revenue
- ROI: 2,359%

**Your first month (optimistic):**
- 5 lawyers × 15 leads each = 75 leads
- 75 leads × $50 = $3,750 revenue
- ROI: 6,049%

**Break-even:** 2 leads (you'll send that in Week 1)

## 🚨 When Things Go Wrong

**"LinkedIn banned me"**
→ You sent too many requests too fast. Read ALEX_THOMPSON_SETUP.md warm-up schedule.

**"No one's responding"**
→ Normal for first 3-5 days. 40-50% acceptance rate is GOOD. Keep going.

**"I don't know what to say to a lawyer who replies"**
→ Use the follow-up template in ALEX_THOMPSON_SETUP.md. Offer to send example lead.

**"Phase 1 isn't finished"**
→ That's okay. Prioritize business identity setup. Phase 1 can wait.

**"I'm scared to reach out"**
→ Normal. Send just ONE request today. Then one more tomorrow. Build momentum.

**"This feels like too much work"**
→ It's 30-60 min/day after setup. Less than scrolling social media.
