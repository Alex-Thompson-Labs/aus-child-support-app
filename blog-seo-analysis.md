## Featured Snippet Optimization (EXCELLENT)

### ✅ What You're Doing Right:

**1. Direct Answer Paragraphs**
Every post has a clear, concise answer paragraph right after the H2 question:

**Example from "How to Calculate Child Support":**
```
H2: How Is Child Support Calculated in Australia?

Answer: Child support in Australia is calculated using an 8-step formula 
that considers both parents' adjusted taxable incomes and care arrangements. 
The formula is: (Your Income % - Your Cost %) × Total Costs of Children. 
Services Australia applies this to determine who pays, how much, and when. 
Most parents pay between $1,815 (minimum) and $30,000+ annually depending 
on income and care.
```

**Why this works for featured snippets:**
- ✅ 40-60 words (ideal length)
- ✅ Answers the question directly
- ✅ Includes specific numbers/data
- ✅ Uses natural language
- ✅ Positioned immediately after H2

**2. FAQ Schema Markup**
All posts include structured FAQ schema:

```javascript
const faqSchema = {
    '@context': 'https://schema.org',
    '@type': 'FAQPage',
    mainEntity: [...]
}
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Google can extract Q&A for rich results
- ✅ Increases chances of FAQ snippet
- ✅ Provides multiple snippet opportunities per page

**3. Bullet Point Lists**
You use bullet points extensively for scannable content:

```
✓ Income Information
• Your taxable income (from last tax return)
• Other parent's taxable income
• Any reportable fringe benefits
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Google loves lists for snippets
- ✅ Easy to extract and display
- ✅ High click-through rate

**4. Step-by-Step Guides**
Posts like "How to Calculate" use numbered steps with HowTo schema:

```javascript
'@type': 'HowTo',
step: [
    { '@type': 'HowToStep', name: 'Gather Required Information', ... },
    { '@type': 'HowToStep', name: 'Calculate Child Support Income', ... }
]
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Google shows step-by-step snippets
- ✅ Rich result eligibility
- ✅ High engagement
